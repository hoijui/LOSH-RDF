    okh:function "The idea behind this OSAT is very simple and nothing groundbreaking. A simple tent stake. To some it may not seem important or essential in any way but those that have pitched a canvas style structure know how valuable they can be. A tent stake doesn't have to hold up just a tent, it can be an anchor for many different kinds of shelters. That is why I thought this would be an appropriate OSAT project." ;
