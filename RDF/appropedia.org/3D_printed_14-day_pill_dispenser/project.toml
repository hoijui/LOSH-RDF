function = "I created a pill holder to hold daily pills for up to 14 days that a professor at Penn State University requested. This is my final project. I initially had a different idea for the lid that would be more efficient and prevent pills from flying everywhere if the dispenser was to be knocked over, but my idea didn't work out, unfortunately. The plan was to have separate slide-in lids, but they wouldn't hold properly. Therefore I went with a standard lid."
