function = "This project stems from the OXFAM equipment catalog and attempts to make a 3D printed version of a speed brace. The purpose of this tool is to quickly remove fasteners after they have been broken loose using a breaker bar or ratchet. This tool is meant to be used with 1/2\" drive sockets.   == Bill of Materials == Here is a bill of materials.
