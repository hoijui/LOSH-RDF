    okh:function "This project stems from the OXFAM equipment catalog and attempts to make a 3D printed version of a speed brace. The purpose of this tool is to quickly remove fasteners after they have been broken loose using a breaker bar or ratchet. This tool is meant to be used with 1/2\" drive sockets.   == Bill of Materials == Here is a bill of materials. Costs are based on a $20.00 / Kg of PLA filament price:  All STL files as well as source files can be found at youmagine.com [1]   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Hobby knife for print cleanup Hammer   == Skills and knowledge needed == Athena Printing Basics 3D Printing Basics:MOST   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions ==   === Recommended Print Settings === All STL files are orientated for printing." ;
