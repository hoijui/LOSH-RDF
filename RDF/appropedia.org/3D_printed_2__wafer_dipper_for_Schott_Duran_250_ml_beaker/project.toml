function = "Motivation for this project is that outside industruial semiconductor production the processed wafer quantities are small. In academia it is common to process 1-3 wafers at a time. Therefore wet etching and other dipping is often done in a beaker. It is quite difficult to find small dippers for 2 inch wafers that fit into a standard 250 ml beaker. This 2 inch wafer dipper is designed to fit into a 250 ml Schott Duran beaker.\neducation, academic research"
