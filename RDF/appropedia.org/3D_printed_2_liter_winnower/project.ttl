    okh:function "Winnowing is a process to remove lighter particles of chaff, dirt, etc from grain and other products typically by throwing it into the air and blowing air on it.   == Bill of Materials == 1 x Winnower Adapter 2 x 2-Liter Bottles 1 x Fan like device (hair dryer is what I used to test it)   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Something to attach the fan if needed.   == Skills and knowledge needed == 3D Printing Knowledge & Capabilities Understand the needs & application for the most efficient customization   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Print adapter. It is recommended to print around 30 mm/s with a 20% infill Print using supports and it is recommended to print with one of the thread sides on the print bed. Break off supports." ;
