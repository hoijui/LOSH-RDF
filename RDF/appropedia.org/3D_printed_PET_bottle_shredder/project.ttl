    okh:function "Included below is three different designs for PET bottle shredders currently designed for 20oz soda bottles but easily expandable for use with 2 liter soda bottles. The first design is a simple hand held shredder which is the simplest design and uses the least plastic. This makes this design ideal for areas which have access to a 3D printer but which filament might not be as readily available. The second design adds a bottle holder to the simple hand held shredder. This holder was added to possibly aid in efficiency." ;
