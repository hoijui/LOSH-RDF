function = "This project sought to demonstrate the viability of 3D printed PLA as a mold material for custom ceramics, investigated through an application to shield gas covers for metal 3D printers. Users of weld-based metal 3D printers sometimes complain of shield gas loss affecting the quality of their prints. A nozzle that fits the weld gun holder could keep the shield gas more local and improve print quality. A nozzle for this purpose must address certain issues:  Material. The material must hold up in a welding environment."
