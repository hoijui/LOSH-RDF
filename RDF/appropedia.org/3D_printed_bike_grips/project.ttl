This design features a substantially better gripping surface than the previous design.   == Bill of Materials == This bike handle is designed to be 3d-printed. It has been tested using standard PLA, but should work with any other standard printing material. Design files can be found here: [1]   == Tools needed == A MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Is sufficient to create this part." ;
