function = "Customizable Bike Handlebar Plug designed using OpenSCAD.   == Bill of Materials == A bike with a handlebar 3D printed Bike Handlebar Plug   == Tools needed == Jellybox or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge necessary to make the OSAT == None except for having an OpenSCAD software in order to customize the plug.   == Technical specifications and assembly instructions == Both a .scad and a .stl file will be provided through a Github link for easy download. Files To successfully print the file make sure your printer is calibrated for a successful print, ie. the extruder produces enough filament for an accurate and reliable print. A print time is estimated to be roughly 50 minutes at a 20 percent infill rate."
