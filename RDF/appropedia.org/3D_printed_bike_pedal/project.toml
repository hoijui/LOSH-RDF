function = "My goal was to create a printable item that would be useful in many regions and I realized that in many countries people rely on bikes. Biking is made much easier and more comfortable when the bike has large flat pedals. Bike pedals can cost much more than some people live off of daily in certain developing nations. The pedal is intended as a usable substitute for a factory bike pedal, though not totally equivalent. OEM components may not be available in certain countries so this pedal may be useful in countries that have access to 3D printing technology, yet do not want to spend the money/ do not have the time to wait months to get an essential part to an essential part of their daily life.\ntransportation, development, hobbyism"
