    okh:function "I have designed a small Bike seat and seat post that can be used to replace an original bike seat. I believe this could be beneficial to people that don't have access to conventional means of purchasing bike parts. The print is done in two parts so that it can be done without supports and takes approximately 5 hours for both prints, but the strength of the seat has not been tested.   == Bill of Materials == 1.75 mm filament (amount depending on size of seat) Plastic epoxy to secure seat top to seat Foam for comfort   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Using the STL's provided you can slice the parts with the settings that best fit your printer. I printed the seat post and topper (module named \"Seat Post\") upside down, which does have a little overhang, but produces a pretty nice print." ;
