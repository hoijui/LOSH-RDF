function = "The cider press is an older technology that has been used for ages to make juices from fruit. The cider press enabled people to move from manually crushing fruit via a mortar and pestle or even two rocks to a self-contained unit that produces more juice in less time. This allowed for the production of cider and other pressed juices at a commercial capacity - beyond subsistence farming. This extra revenue generated from commercial sales of cider can sustainably elevate people from financial poverty and produce a healthier local economy. The goal of the 3D-printable cider press is to provide an affordable means of efficiently pressing cider."
