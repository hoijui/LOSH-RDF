    okh:function "The cider press is an older technology that has been used for ages to make juices from fruit. The cider press enabled people to move from manually crushing fruit via a mortar and pestle or even two rocks to a self-contained unit that produces more juice in less time. This allowed for the production of cider and other pressed juices at a commercial capacity - beyond subsistence farming. This extra revenue generated from commercial sales of cider can sustainably elevate people from financial poverty and produce a healthier local economy. The goal of the 3D-printable cider press is to provide an affordable means of efficiently pressing cider." ;
