function = "An effective method for the diagnosis of severe acute malnutrition is the measurement of the middle upper arm circumference (MUAC). Current methods to measure MUAC in a pre-hospital setting is through the use of measuring tape indicators, which require users to be trained in how to apply, adjust the tightness and read the device properly. This represents a challenge to using MUACs in many developing world contexts. This study explores the technical viability to overcome some of these challenges with conventional MUAC measurement methods using open source 3-D printable click-MUAC bands.   == Source == Michaels, R.E. and Pearce, J.M.
