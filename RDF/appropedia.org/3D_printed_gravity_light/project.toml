function = "This project was to replicate the already produced gravity light into the 3D Printed and open source world.  \tOSAT 3D Printed Gravity Light \t\t \t\t \t\t   == History of the Project == So the project was taken from Gravity Light, and the goal was to turn this product in to a 3D printable product. The project seems so simple but was very hard to get working. We first started off gather some initial data, and it seem like we were going to need a gear reduction of 1:500 which is a crazy amount. So we started off with a small Planetary hand crank light, following the directions and scaling the part by 150% and upping the infill."
