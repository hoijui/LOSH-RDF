function = "In many countries, disposing of PET bottles has caused a major problem. Recycling these bottles proves a difficult challenge. This Bottle Stripper turns PET bottles into long strips that can be used to weave baskets, use as fishing line, use as a type of rope, or possibly even as 3D printer filament. This design spools the strips automatically as it operates.   == Bill of Materials == 1 - File:BottleStripper v2.stl 1 - File:Mounting Base v2.stl 1 - File:Razor Clamp v2.stl 2 - File:Spool Clamp v2.stl 1 - File:Spool Handle 1 v2.stl 1 - File:Spool Handle 2 v2.stl 1 - File:Spool Rod v2.stl 2 - File:Spool Stand v2.stl 6 - M3X10mm Bolts 8 - M3X16mm Bolts 14 - M3 Nuts 10-20 - M3 Washers Many - Standard Utility Blades   == Tools needed == Athena Delta RepRap or equivalent 3D printer PLA or ABS plastic filament .STL Slicer program (Cura/Slic3r/etc.) Appropriate driver for chosen bolts   == Skills and knowledge needed == Proficient knowledge in 3D printer operation Basic mechanical assembly skills   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Download files listed above Print specified number of parts Clean parts as needed with a razor blade Assemble parts as shown in the Completed Assembly photo above."
