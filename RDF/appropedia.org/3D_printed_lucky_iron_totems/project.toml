function = "In some places in the world, people struggle to meet their daily recommended dose of iron. In mild cases, iron deficiencies cause a variety of health problems, including weakness, dizziness, and headaches. More severe cases can lead to heart failure, hemorraging during childbirth, and stunted growth. In developing countries, traditional treatments such as enriching a patient's diet with meat or providing iron supplements don't work because they are either expensive or go against local culture. One inexpensive way to add iron to a person's diet is to boil water for cooking with a lump of iron for 10 minutes before adding any food."
