    okh:function "Soft actuators have grown to be a topic of great scientific interest. As the fabrication of soft actuators with conventional microfabrication methods are tedious, expensive, and time consuming, employment of 3-D printing fabrication methods appears promising as they can simplify fabrication and reduce the production cost. Complex structures can be fabricated with 3-D printing such as helical coils that can achieve actuation performances, which otherwise would be impossible with simpler geometries. In this study, development of soft magnetic helical coil actuators of iron oxide embedded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was achieved with embedded 3-D printing techniques. Composites with three different weight ratios of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % iron nanoparticles to PDMS were formulated." ;
