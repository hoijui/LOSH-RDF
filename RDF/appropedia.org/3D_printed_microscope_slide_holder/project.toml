function = "This fixture is made to hold a 45x75x0.1mm microscope slide on the print bed of a 3-D printer to analyze the warping of prints. This is especially useful when printing with polymers such as polypropylene, which have a tendency to warp at the edges. The slide holder has two feet on the bottom that allow it to sit flat on the print bed and a connection across the top so the fixture is one piece. There is a slot in the middle for holding the slide in place. The slot is 0.5 mm wide, to ensure it is large enough to be 3-D printable but not too large that the 0.1mm thick slide will move around too much."
