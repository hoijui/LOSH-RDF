function = "An otoscope is simple device used in the diagnosis of ear, nose, and throat diseases. It is essentially a magnification lens with a light and speculum to help open orifices and direct the light. It is commonly used to examine the eardrum, which as the border separating the external ear canal from the middle ear, often has characteristics indicative of various diseases of the middle ear space. OpenSCAD was used to make all the 3D printed parts used in this model.  \t\t \t\t \t\t   == Bill of Materials == Printed Parts:  The main otoscope body weights 20 grams."
