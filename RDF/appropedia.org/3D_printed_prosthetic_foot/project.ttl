    okh:function "An open sourced appropriate technology OSAT can be used to help people in need. This 3D printable prosthetic foot design was built to help reach out to those in need of a foot. Prosthetics have been around for a long time and are in the simplest form just sticks or the next level carved wood. Think of pirate's who had hooks or stick legs. Today there are a range of devices on the market to help aid those in need, even some that are very similar to the robotic hands that Luke and Darth Vader have in Star Wars." ;
