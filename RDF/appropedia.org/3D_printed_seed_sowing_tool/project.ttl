A handle can be attached to the device, using an 8mm bolt (not shown in figures or attached currently) (A hollow tube will enable seeds to be dropped from within the handle.)   == Calculations and measurements == Wheel diameter: 60mm base, 64mm including teeth. Shaft diameter: 30mm Number of seed holes on shaft: 3 Seed Hole maximum depth: 7mm Seed Hole maximum width: 10mm Length(along the shaft): 100mm Height from ground: 90mm, 92mm including teeth. Weight: 120g, including 3mm nuts and bolts The seeds fall at equal intervals(approx;6.3cm in the dimensions given:2*3.14*(Radius of wheel)/(No." ;
