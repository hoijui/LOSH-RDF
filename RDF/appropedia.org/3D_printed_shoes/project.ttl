    okh:function "\"A lack of adequate footwear is more than a simple inconvenience or lack of comfort. Millions are infected or dying each year due to the spread of diseases contracted through unprotected feet. It is estimated that two billion people worldwide are currently plagued with parasitic diseases that could be prevented by wearing proper footwear.\"  Walking barefoot hardens the skin on the bottom of your feet and cracks may form. These cracks allow parasitic infections such as hookworm and threadworm to penetrate the skin. In addition to shoes protecting against harmful parasites, shoes also protect against burns, cuts and punctures." ;
