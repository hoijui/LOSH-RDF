function = "This page contains the instructions and files necessary to 3D-print a loudspeaker. This isn't the best sounding speaker on the planet - it could definitely use some tuning, a better suspension, and a real enclosure, but it serves as a very low-cost (~$1.25) solution for producing audio. The original intention of this design is as an educational aide - a speaker is one of the most effective ways to illustrate the interactions between electricity and magnetism. A lesson plan will be included at a later date to guide this education.   == Bill of Materials == 3D Printed Components Enclosure - Holds the suspension and the magnet."
