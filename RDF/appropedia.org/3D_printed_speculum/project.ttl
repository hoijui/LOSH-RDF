    okh:function "3D printed parts are able to be rapidly produced at low cost making them ideal for disposable medical equipment. In areas where advanced medical equipment or lack of space for sanitizing existing equipment the 3D printer is the next best option. The speculum designed can be used for several different applications in the human anatomy all based on the scale and infill printed at. This speculum takes a different design that current production models to eliminate the need for pivot hardware or large joints. The open jaw design allows for greater operating and inspection area." ;
