function = "There have been news reports on Gizmodo and IFL Science of an experiment in Shanghai using 3D printers to create housing. Construction is fast — an experimental ten-house village went up in a day — and cheap, around $5000 a house. Some of the materials used are recycled waste. This uses a different technology than the Dutch experiment which aims at printing an entire house on-site. The Chinese firm, Winsun Engineering (site is in Chinese), instead prints components for pre-fab houses in a factory."
