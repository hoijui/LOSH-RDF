Also the new stand has a counterpoise or counterweight that can be pushed along and turned around the standard and which is connected via a rope to the protruding part of the longest arm. The movement of the protruding part of the longest arm is not limited by a stop. The hinge point is preferably subjected to friction and/or is preferably provided with a nut and bolt to make the adjustment of the parallelogram construction stiffer."
