function = "Built in the fall of 2003, this cob bench located at 4th and F St in Arcata, California, was completed by Humboldt State student Patrick McAuley. The cob bench was constructed in the garden of Arcata resident Lisa Jackson and is viewable from Samoa Blvd.  The project was organized through an appropriate technology class (Engineering 305) at Humboldt State University and served as a final project for McAuley. Project leaders were natural builder Kirsten Thompson, appropriate technology course instructor Lonny Grafman and Patrick McAuley.    == Materials ==  McAuley and crew gathered materials for the construction of the bench around the city of Arcata."
