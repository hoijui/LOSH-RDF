function = "For the Spring 2021 class project of the Engineering 535, Development Technology class at Humboldt State University, we were tasked with designing, building and testing an affordable and easily replicable wildfire smoke mitigating air filtration system for low income families or individuals. The Do It Yourself (DIY) air filter was deigned to efficiently filter particulate matter in wildfire smoke and PM 2.5 (particulate matter 2.5) from other indoor pollutants. The ease of use for people with physical disabilities was also considered as seen in the inclusion of swivel caster wheels at the bottom of the air filter. The efficiency and cost effectiveness of the DIY air filter was found to be equivalent to that of a typical off the shelf air filter system.   == Materials used: ==   ==== Essential materials ==== 4 Pieces of ACE 14*20*1 inche high performance pleated air filters with a MERV13 rating 1 Piece POLAR-AIRE Household 9\" Personal Fan 2 Pieces of hard cardboard 1 Roll Duct Tape   ==== Additional optional  materials ==== 4 pieces swivel caster wheels 1 piece long fiber string 1 Gorilla Glue I small piece of rubber   == Required tools == A pair of scissors, a marker or pencil and a hand saw.\nWildfire smog mitigation"
