    okh:function """For the Spring 2021 semester of Engineering 535, Development Technology at Humboldt State University (HSU), we partnered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the SAFE project team of the Schatz Energy Research Center at HSU (SAFE = Smoke, Air, Fire, Energy) to develop technology systems related to wildfire smoke mitigation. The goal of our team was to design, build, and test a low-cost air filtration systems designed to remove airborne particulates generated by wildfires and other emission sources from residential indoor spaces. When deciding on the final design of the DIY unit, we took into consideration the efficacy of the filter with regard to removing PM2.5 particulates from the indoor space, the relative costs of the filter systems (considering initial and operating costs), and other factors such as usability, replicability, accessibility, reliability, and convenience. A complete project report can be found here.   == Materials and Costs == Required Materials for the Triangular-shaped air filter design  The total costs for this design were slightly over $70, the price could be lower if one has any of the above materials already in their possession.
