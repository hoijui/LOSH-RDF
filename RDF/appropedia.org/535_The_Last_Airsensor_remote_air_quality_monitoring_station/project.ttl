    okh:function "This page documents the final course project for the Spring 2021 ENGR 535 (Development Technology) course at Humboldt State University. Our team was tasked to design and deploy a stand-alone air monitoring system that can monitor the air quality in a location which has cellular connectivity and reasonable solar access, but without access to power and internet. Our project was deployed at the Blue Lake Rancheria in Humboldt County, CA. This page includes a design and construction and user manual for our final product.   == Bill of Materials ==   == Wooden Mount ==   === Components and Tools === 1 (or two maybe) x wooden pallet 1 x pry bar ~10 1\" nails ~20 x 3\" wood screws ~50 x Â½\" wood screws ~20 x 1\" wood screws 1 x 12\" long metal plate 14 x Steel L Angles 1 x hand saw 1 x screwdriver or electric hand drill 1 x protractor or some kind of angle measuring tool 1 x hammer   === Assembly ===   == Junction Box ==   === Components and Tools === 1 x (16\" x12\" x7\") Electrical Junction Box 1 x 10A Charge Controller 1 x 12V 30Ah LFP Battery 1 x KuWfi Hotspot 1 x 5V KuWfi charging cable 1 x 5V Air Sensor Charging Cable 5 x Cable Weather-proof Glands 1 x DC disconnect switch 1 x 7.5A 12V Blade Fuse 1 x Inline Blade Fuse Holder 1 x Drill   === Assembly ===   == Final Unit Assembly ==   === Components and tools === Components that are constructed in the sub-assembly process are used to build the final unit    1 x Wooden mount 1 x Air Sensor 1 x Junction Box 2 x Solar panel 4 x M8 nylock nuts 4 x 2\" M8 bolts 1 x 2\" wood screw 2 x M8 Metal Washer 2 x metal braces 1 x Wrench/socket wrench 1 x Screwdriver (for whichever type of wood screw you purchase)   === Assembly ===   === Time-lapse of Assembly === In addition to the instructions above, this time-lapse of the assembly may help more visual learners assemble the system.   == User Manual == This section outlines how to set up the cellular hotspot, deploy the unit, and access air quality data." ;
