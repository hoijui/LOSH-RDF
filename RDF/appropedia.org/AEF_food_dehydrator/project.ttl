    okh:function """The purpose of building a solar dehydrator is to provide the Arcata Educational Farm with a reliable hybrid dehydrator. Its goal is to help preserve surplus crops. In addition to using this dehydrator as an alternative method in preserving vegetable, fruits, and meat, it will promote sustainable practices. This solar dehydrator will not only serve as a tool for preserving and storing foods, it will also be a demonstration. This display is designed for the farmers, share holders, and communities members so that they may witness and apply sustainable and alternative technology to their everyday lives.
