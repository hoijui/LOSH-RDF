    okh:function "As a student in Lonny's Engr. 305 class, I carried out a project that involved troubleshooting, repairing, testing and maintaining a preexisting off-grid photovoltaic system located at the Arcata Educational Farm, on Old Arcata road, Arcata, CA. This project was carried out over the 2009 spring semester. The goal of the project is to provide AEF with a renewable source of off-grid electricity. The electricity powers an answering machine and a portable stereo system for the enjoyment of the farmers. The AEF provided a binder full of literature on the photovoltaic system; including operating manuals for the inverter, charge controller, and answering machine, as well as troubleshooting guidelines and performance monitoring checklists." ;
