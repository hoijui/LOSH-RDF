    okh:function "The following is a statement from the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group (AIDG) about biodigesters and how they work: \"Unlike a septic tank, which is not sealed and vents methane, as well as passing ef- fluent to its leach field, a biodigester is a sealed system that intentionally promotes the controlled buildup of methane. As methane builds up in the chamber, it in- creases to a level that kills parasites and cysts. More waste is added to the cham- ber and is slowly consumed and sterilized by the . . . bacteria. As time passes, this sterilized effluent builds and flows through the exit of the chamber." ;
