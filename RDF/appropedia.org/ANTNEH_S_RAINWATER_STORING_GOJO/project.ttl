Gojo in the local term) that also act as a rain water collector and storage.   == Understanding the market == According to resources, there are more than 1 billion migrants in the world today and water deficits are linked to 10% of the rise in global migration. The World Bank’s just-released flagship publication “Ebb and Flow: Water, Migration, and Development” shows that it is a lack of water, rather than too much, that has a greater impact on migration. Water has always influenced where we live.
