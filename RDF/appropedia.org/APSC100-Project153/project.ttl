    okh:function "APSC100: Project #153: Design for Health in Peru Preliminary work on the design of a Health Care Centre in Peru found that one of the primary health care problems in Peru is the lack of access to safe drinking water. Although, the water and sanitation sector in Peru has made important advances in the last two decades (including the increase of water access from 30% to 62% between 1980 and 2004 and sanitation access has also increased from 9% to 30% from 1985 to 2004 in rural areas), the majority of people living in rural areas do not have reliable access to safe drinking water. Current issues with water in Peru include contamination with fecal coliforms and poor sanitation. This results in bacterial contamination and sickness. To reduce the number of patients at the Health Care Centre and thus limit the size to meet the low budget â€“ people in the region could be given household-scale solar water pasteurization devices." ;
