function = "Solar Powered XO Laptop - the use of photovoltaic technology   === Community Sponsor === Queen’s Applied Sustainability Research Group TA: Nabeil Alazzam Faculty Consultant: Dr. Pearce, MME   === Background === The Queen’s Applied Sustainability Research Group has partnered with several organizations focused on providing open source appropriate technology to developing communities. One method of technology transfer is using information built into the XO. The XO, previously known as the $100 Laptop (or OLPC), is an inexpensive subnotebook computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world, to provide them with access to knowledge, and opportunities to \"explore, experiment and express themselves\" (constructionist learning). The laptop is developed by the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization and manufactured by Quanta Computer. The subnotebooks are designed for sale to government-education systems which then give each primary school child their own laptop."
