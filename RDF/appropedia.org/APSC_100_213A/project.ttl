    okh:function "The XO laptop can only reach its full potential if it can be powered. In many of the areas that the XO laptop is being deployed, electrical sockets are not available. Another way must be found to charge and power the laptop for the device to be an effective tool. Although these countries may not have electricity available from their walls, another solution exists. The XO laptop can be powered by the sun, which can power technology through solar panels." ;
