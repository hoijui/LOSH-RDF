The organization has produced a laptop known as the XO laptop to be distributed to children in developing countries. Unfortunately the majority of these children have no access to electricity in order to power the laptops. Solar energy has thusbeen proposed as a convenient alternative to energy that requires a great deal of infrastructure." ;
