function = "The Spring 2020 semester required rapid adaptation and cooperation in order to stay resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, our project also had to adapt and change. Our group includes Scarlett Trippsmith, Gilbert Trejo, Christine Marks, and Joseph Hajduk of Lonny Grafman's ENGR 305 course. While we had originally planned to create a project for Abuelita's Garden, a community garden in Eureka, CA, we had to change plans after finding ourselves in quarantine. Our project now reflects the spaces and resources we are limited to and our ability to adapt!"
