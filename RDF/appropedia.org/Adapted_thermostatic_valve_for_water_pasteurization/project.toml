function = "The task is to adapt a widely available thermostatic valve for use in the solar water pasteurizer. The thermostatic valve that will be used comes from the coolant system in automobiles. The thermostat in automobiles utilizes a wax core which expands with increased heat, pushing a piston and ultimately opens the valve.   == Project requirements == To alter an existing thermostatic valve for use in a water pasteurization system using simple labour and cheap materials. The device must be readily accessible and easily modifiable.\ndevelopment, industry, water"
