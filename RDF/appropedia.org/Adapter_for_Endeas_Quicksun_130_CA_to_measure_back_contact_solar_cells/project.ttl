    okh:function "== Designer == Ismo T.S. Heikkinen' Aalto University, Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering   == Project == Nanostructured silicon surfaces (black silicon, bSi) show great promise in solar cell applications due to their superb absorbance on a wide spectrum of light and wide angle of acceptance. In order to get all the benefit out of the high-absorbing bSi surface,it is beneficial to build high-efficiency bSi solar cells so that all the electrical contacts are on the back of the cell. However, the Electron Physics research group currently lacks the experimental setup for measuring the efficiency of these kinds of solar cells. In addition to this, there are no simple commercial solutions for measuring the angle dependence of solar cell efficiency, at least to my knowledge. In this project, I aim to overcome these limitations by designing a 3D-printable measurement stage adapter for the Endeas Quicksun 130 CA solar simulator using OpenSCAD. The parametrized wafer adapter can be customized to fit round wafers of all sizes, and it is possible to equip the adapter with a rotating motor that enables angle-dependent measurements." ;
