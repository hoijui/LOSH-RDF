    okh:function "Dr. Parker within the ME-EM department at Michigan Tech University has had a need for components capable of adjusting the level at which the waves in the wave tank meet the wave gauges mounted above the water. Currently, a block is just being rotated between the intersecting cross members to raise all wave gauge levels at once, and they have no way to individually adjust the locations of each wave gauge. The solution posted here includes an interconnecting system to slide onto the 8020 where it intersects on each side of the wave tank, to use in order to be able to raise the cross member and all wave gauges mounted on it a specified level at once. The top and bottom blocks slide onto the 8020, where the middle block connects the top and bottom to add or remove height." ;
