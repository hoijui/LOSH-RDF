    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality across the world. Although there is a safe and effective drug, oxytocin, that is widely administered to prevent excessive bleeding, the method of administration is often risky in resource-poor settings. Currently, oxytocin can only be administered via injection into the bloodstream by trained medical personnel, and furthermore, the drug needs to be refrigerated to retain its effects. Thus, administration of oxytocin requires sterile equipment, clean water, skilled practitioners, and electricity, all of which are not easily feasible in many developing countries.   == Detailed description of the solution == Researchers have developed a more stable, low-cost, aerosol formulation of oxytocin that can be inhaled through a basic, disposable device and does not require cold-chain storage." ;
