function = "The natural hut is to encourage more use of the Nature Park. This is a space to sit and to learn more about environmental education A Nature Hut was built at Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village during September-October 2012. We used a fusion of building techniques including: traditional Rwandan building techniques with grass, wood frame and Earthbag/Superadobe construction. We prepared a picture filled instruction manual on How to Make A Nature Hut so as to help others continue a project like this in the future. It is a very simple design and can be adapted to different places, using different materials."
