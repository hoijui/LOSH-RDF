function = "At Agricultural Innovations, we are trying to find ways to leverage communities like Appropedia to do real time development and deployment of appropriate technologies for development projects in the Third World. Our focus is Bolivia, South America, a fantastic place but the poorest country on the continent. We believe that through decentralized, network-based technology development we can provide better services and products more cheaply and efficiently than would be possible through a traditional top-down approach. Help us make this dream a reality.   === The Project === Our project has multiple components, but the central thrust has three primary objectives:  To develop a model for community-based technology centers, with a focus on tech transfer using appropriate technologies that can be prototyped, validated, and commercialized for future business and community development To focus on the rehabilitation of degraded and eroded lands, with a special focus on soil and water resource management To develop a North-South axis of interaction, where Northern professionals can provide technical and financial resources to Southern tinkers and innovators   === Technological Possibilities === We do not want to limit potential collaborators to a specific area of intervention."
