It is a stationary technology for the production of vegetables whereby the gantry is attached at one end to a fixed joint and at the other has an electric motor propelling a wheel. A steel frame is used as a carrier unit for different instruments. The fields are therefore circular, and the system is also known as "Agrocircle".
