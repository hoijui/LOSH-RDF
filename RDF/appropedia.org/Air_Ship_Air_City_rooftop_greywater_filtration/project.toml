function = "How can an individual, especially in an urban setting, reclaim their water? Grey water filtration has become increasingly popular here in the US as part of the movement towards sustainability. Grey water can be remediated through mechanical, biological, and chemical processes. Our project will focus on using reclaimed materials to construct a system that filters grey water through the use of biological and mechanical filtration processes. For this project our team will be developing a small system for a rooftop application in Brooklyn, NY. As water use rises its is increasingly important to use the water to it's full extent and explore ways to remediate and reclaim water that has become contaminated.\nwater purification"
