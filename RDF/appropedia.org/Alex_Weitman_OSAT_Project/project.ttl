Her page can be found here: Alex.weitman  This OSAT project was completed for the Engineering 242 class at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois.   == Project Background == The purpose of the OSAT project is for me to improve upon another project that someone else has done. Here are the original project and my improvement project side by side (my project is still in the STL file stage, not printed yet):  	OSAT Projects 		 		   == OSAT Pointed Tent Stake == Project developed by User:Alex.weitman   == Abstract == This project is done to create a better version of a tent stake that I found. My version has a better head to use a hammer on, it is twisty like the original, but it also has a point on the end of it so it can pierce the ground better and is able to twist in after that." ;
