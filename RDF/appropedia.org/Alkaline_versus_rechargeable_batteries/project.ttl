    okh:function "This is a review of the available literature pertinent to a life cycle analysis (LCA) of standard and rechargeable closed cell batteries. This category of battery includes the consumer familiar AA, AAA, C, D, and 9V battery types. Although the scope of this project is not to perform an LCA from scratch, the hope is that available literature, and additions from readers like you, will complete the content of this page. The sections of this wiki include: (1) basics of battery technology, (2) the distinction between primary vs. secondary batteries, (3) specifics of three different battery types that are a representative sample, (4) an LCA review including aspects of manufacturing, distribution, use and disposal." ;
