function = "== Problem being addressed == There is a strong need for improved laboratory diagnosis for TB.  Stains such as the Ziehl-Neelsen are inaccurate, time intensive, and subject to interpretation.  A new fluorescent stain called Auromine O (AuO) appears to be the future of TB microscopy, but the issue is the availability of fluorescent scopes.  The AFTER LED fluorescence device is an add-on component that can be used as an attachment to most of the already available microscopes.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device is an add-on to Olympus, Carl Zeiss, Nikon, Leica, and Motic microscopes that uses low-cost LEDs for fluorescent microscopy.  The LEDs provide an upgrade over old technologies like mercury and xenon by allowing for significant increase in performance, lifetime, and operating costs."
