function = "The capstone project for Queen's University 4th Year Mechanical Engineering Class,\"Engineering for Sustainable Development\", is to design and construct an Appropriate Technology with a quantifiable engineering result (to see other class projects, click here). I have chosen to construct a greenhouse, review the heat requirement on the system for the whole year; then, based on the materials and conditions selected, review costs associated with this and build a scaled model. This project is the first step to easy community greenhouse development - the goal of the affordable greenhouse is to:  Improve greenhose design and awareness for residential application. Demonstrate the feasibility (i.e costs) of a greenhouse in the winter months and determine the best time to install such a system for optimal crop yield. Due to the materials selected and the cold Canadian Spring, it is not effective to construct until late April."
