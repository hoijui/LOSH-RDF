function = "Solar cookers are not a new idea. Designers as far back as the 19th century recognized the potential of the sun's energy to provide heat for cooking and other purposes and designed appropriate tools to harness it.It is indeed likely that solar energy was used for cooking long before then. Solar cookers have many potential benefits, both to their user and to the environment. A frequently cited advantage of solar cookers is that they reduce users' dependence on fuel sources for cooking. This reduction has economic benefit to the user by reducing their expenditure on fuel and also environmental benefit by reducing deforestation (in regions where wood is used as a cooking fuel) and release of combustion products into the atmosphere."
