    okh:function "Plantar Fasciitis is a common foot disorder which can cause severe, sharp pains in the heel due to inflammation of the plantar fascia, tissue which runs across the bottom of the foot. It's common in both athletes and non-athletes, and while the symptoms tend to reduce within the first hour after waking in the morning, the pain can return after long periods of walking or standing up. Continued non-treatment can lead to chronic plantar fasciitis which can lead to serious degradation of the tissue and constant pain, rendering the patient unable to walk. An easy treatment in the earlier stages of the injury can be the use of ankle splints during sleep which helps lengthen the plantar fascia to reduce inflammation. Night tension splints, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and viscoelastic heel cushion and stretching program can be used as an effective treatment for plantar fasciitis, according to one study [3]." ;
