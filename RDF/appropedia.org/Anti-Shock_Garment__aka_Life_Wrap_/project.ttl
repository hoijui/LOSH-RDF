    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == The leading cause of maternal mortality is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). PPH can result from a number of conditions, including uterine atoney and cervical lacerations, which can cause severe blood loss, shock, and then death. Shock can occur due to a lack of oxygen in the heart, lungs, and brain due to a low blood flow in these areas.   == Detailed description of the solution == The anti-shock garment applies pressure to the legs in order to push blood out of the legs and back into the upper body. Other devices rely on pumps or bladders to dynamically change the pressure applied to the lower body." ;
