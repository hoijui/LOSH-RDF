function = "== Problem being addressed == Research shows that children in Africa that are born at home are extremely unlikely to receive drugs within 24 hours of birth to prevent the spread of HIV from mother to child.  Because conventional containers cannot store the drug because they destroy the active ingredient, the only way for mothers to administer the antiretroviral drugs to their newborn child is to travel to a clinic immediately after birth. This is often quite difficult and leaves millions of infants at risk of becoming HIV+ during the birthing process.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Pratt Pouch is a foil pouch lined with plastic that holds a dose of anti-retroviral medication. The pouch resembles a ketchup packet and can effectively store the medication to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV for months."
