function = "Scalable Aquaponics System Bins. The OSAT project I wanted to tackle was Goal 2, \"No Hunger\". For this goal, I decided to design a scalable aquaponics system that can be modified to be used in most water sources (pond, lake, river, ocean inlet). The idea behind this prototype is that you can buy a singular block and then scale the layout later. This is especially helpful for third-world countries where individuals are living off about a dollar a day and can only afford one block to start."
