function = "== Abstract == The Mechanical Munchy-Maker is a mechanical bicycle that turns human leg power into mechanical rotation and generates energy to power a kitchen appliance, such as a blender. It is designed to turn human leg power into mechanical rotation. As the user begins to pedal the stationary bike, the crank turns the front wheel using a chain drive. The front wheel is in contact with a spline-shaft that converts vertical circular motion into horizontal motion. The spline-shaft utilizes the friction produced by the contact of the spinning wheel with the spline-shaft to turn the blade on the blender."
