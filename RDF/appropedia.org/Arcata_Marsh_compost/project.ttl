    okh:function "The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant processes the biosolids from the digester into compost at its onsite composting facility. The finished compost is used as a soil amendment by the City of Arcata Parks and Recreation department throughout Arcata city parks.   == Compost Ingredients ==   === Biosolids ===  Biosolids are the solid and semisolid organic matter produced from wastewater treatment facilities. Although historically called \"sludge,\" biosolids (as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency) differ in respect to the fact that sludge refers to untreated, raw sewage, whereas biosolid refers to the beneficial by-product of sewage treatment that can be used in composting. The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant processes its sludge into Class A- Exceptional Quality biosolid." ;
