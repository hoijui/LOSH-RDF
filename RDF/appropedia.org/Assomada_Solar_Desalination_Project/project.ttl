    okh:function """With <200mm of rainfall, saltwater infiltrated wells and expensive oil-guzzling desalination plants as the main source of fresh water in Cape Verde, it is important to consider researching alternative sources of production. As an island country with endless supply of seawater and over 3000 hours of annual sunlight, Cape Verde is an ideal country for solar desalination. The goal of the project is to design a high output, cost-effective model using local materials. If a cheap design with reasonable output can be engineered, it could create both an industry of employment for young Capeverdeans and, given the abundant supply of sun and saltwater, a reliable source of fresh water for the country. Project developed by Brian Newhouse, bri.newhouse@gmail.com   == Project Analysis == This is the third phase of this solar desalination project: Phase I-The first phase was a 0.82m2 prototype model completed and tested in December 2007.
