function = "The Athena 3D printer is a RepRap derived from the Most Delta Printer with the additional design goals:  Even simpler assembly Perfect match for Franklin firmware Clean wire management Easier maintenance Greater flexibility Efficient use of materials Improved print quality The design borrows heavily from the Most Delta Printer, keeping all of the features that have proven to be effective and adding some new. It has the same build volume but uses metal GT2 pulleys and GT2 timing belt with approximately twice the positioning precision of the MOST Delta. All electronics are tucked away under the build platform and wiring management is improved with the addition of built-in passages and anchor points in idler and motor ends. The design utilizes the improved extruder drive and the MOST Delta's end effector fitted with quick release pneumatic couplers for simplified assembly and easier maintenance. The open top makes for better use of wood and removes a resonator, making the machine quieter and more flexible."
