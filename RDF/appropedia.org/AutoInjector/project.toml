function = "AutoInjectors are a spring-loaded device that aides in delivering the proper dosages of certain medicines. The have built-in adjusters to ensure the medicine is delivered at the proper depth in the body. They are useful for those that have trouble using a simple needle for injections, possibly children, the elderly, or those with needle-phobias. They are also useful for injecting pets with their medication. The AutoInjector keeps the needle covered until injection time to prevent injury, and some have a built-in safe measure of requiring the injector to be pushed against the skin before the trigger button can be pushed to prevent accidental discharge."
