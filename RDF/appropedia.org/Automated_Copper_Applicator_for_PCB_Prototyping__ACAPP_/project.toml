function = "The goal of this project is to create a machine capable of manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCB) in an efficient and \"green\" way. There are many methods which could be used, but it was decided that the best method to use would be a unique copper tape applicator. Because of this, the machine is named Automated Copper Applicator for PCB Prototyping (ACAPP). ACAPP is still a work in progress, but all of the methodology is planned and is within the range of execution. In this report I will discuss how processes are selected, as well as the finer details of execution."
