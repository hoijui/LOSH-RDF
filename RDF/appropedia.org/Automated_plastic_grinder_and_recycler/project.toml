function = "There is a very large need for an affordable and strong plastic grinder. With current models on the market that are made from steel and require numerous parts and fittings costing upwards of $400, cheaper versions could be appealing to customers. We have created a mostly 3D printed grinder using a combination of PLA and Polycarbonate parts and a few other pieces of hardware. This design utilizes two hex shafts with 5 teeth per shaft, encased in a solid 3D printed box. The shaft is driven using a windshield wiper motor which is powered by an old computer power supply."
