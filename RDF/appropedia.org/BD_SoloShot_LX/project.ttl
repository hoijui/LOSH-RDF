    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Systematic immunization of newborn children plays a vital role in reducing the disease burden around the world, and syringes and needles are obviously of utmost importance in performing immunizations.  However, the misuse of these devices contributes to the transmission of deadly blood-borne diseases such as Hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS.  Each year, more than 12 billion injections are administered worldwide; last year in developing countries an estimated 50 percent of injections were deemed to be unsafe.  When syringes and needles are reused on multiple patients, disease can easily be transmitted from one patient to another.   == Detailed description of the solution == The BD SoloShot LX Syringe is designed to prevent the syringe and the needle from being reused.  After an injection is given to a patient, the plunger automatically locks and the syringe and needle cannot be reused." ;
