    okh:function "The BREAD (Broadly Reconfigurable and Expandable Automation Device) Servo Motor Control Slice is a circuit board with an Arduino Nano and five ports at which one can connect a servo motor. Commands can then be sent through the Arduino, allowing the motors to be controlled.   == Documentation == Command Structure Argument 1: Command ID   Command 1: mode command Command 2: value command Argument 2: read / write bit (!R/W)  0: read 1: write Argument 3: Parameter 1  Currently always used to specify the motor channel Argument 4: Parameter 2  Currently always used to specify data to be written when !R/W = 1 (write), and always ignored when !R/W = 0 (read) All 4 of these arguments are stored as integers for the time being.  Command 0 - Test Does nothing.  Command 1 - Mode !R/W:  0: read The command will return the motor's mode 1: write Set the motor's mode Param1: Channel - Select which motor to apply the command to  Acceptable values: 0 <= X <= 5 Param2:  Read Mode: N/A Write Mode: Mode to set the motor to Acceptable Mode Values:  0: Normal Mode Motor will move as fast as possible 1 - 5: Slow Mode Motor will turn more slowly, with 5 being the slowest Values greater than 5 may work, but are untested  Command 2 - Value !R/W:  0: read The command will return the motor's current position 1: write Set the motor's target position Param1: Channel - Select which motor to apply the command to  Acceptable values: 1 <= X <= 5 Param2:  Read Mode: N/A Write Mode: The position to move the motor to  Slow Mode When the mode of a motor channel is set to a non-zero value (1 <= X <= 5), the motor will not move at its mazimum speed." ;
