function = "I decided to construct a bike trailer for personal use. Since I am an Arcata resident, I find to easy and enjoyable to bike everywhere except when I have to move around things that don't fit into by backpack. Thus, a bike trailer would be the logical solution to my problem. It will allow me to be self reliant. A rain flap will be incorporated into the design for usage in foul weather, since it tends to rain quite often here."
