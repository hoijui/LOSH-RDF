    okh:function "This simple motor was constructed from a 10.5cm section of bamboo, a set of battery terminals, a magnet, roughly one meter of wrapping wire, and about 10 cm of standard shielded wire. It was inspired by a quick suggestion by my teacher Lonny Grafman. In the midst of our Appropriate Technology instruction for the Parras 2008 program, it seemed only acceptable to build it out of already available materials. It is a project that can be done by almost anyone with a little patience and some extra time. It is a valuable for teaching some of the basic principles of electricity as well as the basics of a direct current electric motor." ;
