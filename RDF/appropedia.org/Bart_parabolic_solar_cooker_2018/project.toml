function = "Parabolic solar cookers are designed to utilize the sun's vast supply of energy to do what we all need to do from time to time, cook food! Instead of cranking up the gas oven or turning on an electric stove, we can harness the sun's energy to focus light to generate enough heat to make food, or even distill water. This project was originally inspired by Bart Orlando in Spring of 2018, for a class project in Appropiate Technology Course at Humboldt State University.   == Problem statement == The objective of this project was to make a solar cooker with Bart Orlando as the client. The idea of solar cookers has been around for quite some time now."
