    okh:function "Bayside Park Farms in Arcata is a community supported agriculture (CSA) that provides positive benefits for its members and for the community at large. The farm wishes to be able to bake the food that it produces on site into pizzas and otherwise for the purpose of community building as well as for fundraising events for the farm itself. This earthen oven project will fill the farm's stated need for such an oven and will allow the farm to engage in further community building/fundraising activities.   == Background == For Engr305 Appropriate Technology at Humboldt State University we will be constructing an earthen at oven at Bayside Park Farm in Arcata, CA. An earthen oven is an ancient device and is constructed primarily of clay, sand, and straw. Once a fire is burned inside the oven and removed the oven's walls can cook food via radiant heat." ;
