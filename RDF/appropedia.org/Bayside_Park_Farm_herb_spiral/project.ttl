    okh:function "The Bayside Park Farm is a three-acre vegetable farm located in the City of Arcata's Bayside Park and became the first Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) in Arcata. A CSA is a community supported agriculture program where shareholders pledge their support in the spring and receive a share of the harvest every week for the growing season. Bayside Park Farm is also a permaculture farm demonstrating sustainable farming practices and appropriate means of energy use. In 2010, the Engr305 Appropriate Technology class at Humboldt State University in Arcata built an herb spiral on the farm. The current farmers flattened the herb spiral since it was not functioning as hoped, and had issues such as insufficient water drainage and mint and weed overgrowth." ;
