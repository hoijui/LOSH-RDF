function = "This project seeks to plan and implement a rainwater catchment system on the rooftop of one of the buildings of the Bayside Park Farm (Figure 1). The main goal is to canalize the rainwater in order to water part of the crop during the dry months.   == Background == Bayside Park Farm is an educational farm located in Humboldt County in the city of Arcata, CA. The farm has the goal to connect citizens, students and local farms through sustainable and organic agriculture methods.  For the course ENGR 305: Appropriate Technology at Humboldt State University (HSU), our group will develop a project for Bayside Park Farm with the intention of reusing rainwater to supply some needs of the farm. According to the people who work in the farm, the rainwater collected in the winter should be stored to be used in the summer."
