function = "Our project was to rebuild the Bayside Park Farm solar hot water heater that was disassembled during construction of the new dish washing/vegetable washing station. We started our project by assessing how we wanted to set the system back up, how we wanted to improve it, and by doing research on the system. Once we knew what we wanted and understood the heater fully, we began construction and completed it in steps. Step 1 was to fix the broken sink plumbing. Step 2 was to build a rack for the solar collector."
