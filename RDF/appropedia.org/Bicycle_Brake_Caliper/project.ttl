Open source bicycles could reduce the cost of transportation for people that cannot afford to buy a commercial bicycle. This project can be combined with others to make a largely cheaper and printable bicycle.   == Bill of Materials == (Makes Two Calipers) Files  Brake Caliper SCAD Model File:Caliper.stl Commercial Parts  2x Commercial Brake Pads Cost = $4.98 8x M6x1 Torx Bolts Cost = $0.63 8x M6 Nuts Cost = $0.04 8x M6 Washers Cost = $0.05 1x Brake Line Guide Cost = $1.59 (For two)   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer T30 Torx Screwdriver 10mm wrench   == Skills and knowledge needed == N/A   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == (I do not currently have all the necessary materials so they will not all be shown here." ;
