    okh:function "A bicycle is a common form of transportation in developing countries. It is relatively cheap, fast, and effective. Since bicycles are used for transportation, a cargo rack is a helpful accessory for hauling goods or personal items. A 3D printable cargo rack was designed to fulfill this purpose in a very economical way. The rack is symmetrical and can be easily adjusted in the script for different bike sizes, seat tube angles, and seat tube diameters." ;
