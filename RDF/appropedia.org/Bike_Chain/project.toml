function = "This design can be printed to produce a bicycle chain to be used with a bike. This design can fit under multiple OSAT goals that involve cheaper transportation for creating a mostly 3D printed bicycle. There is one other design for a 3D printed chain, however the design is not listed for actual use due to its lack of strength. This design has more strength to it, without taking away the ease of assembly that the other option has.   == Bill of Materials == [Github Source Code & STLs] [Thingiverse Link]   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == N/A   == Technical Specifications == Print settings for bike chain used (feel free to experiment with other options):  Layer Height: 0.1 mm Shell Thickness: 1mm Bottom-Top thickness: 0.5mm Fill Desnity 30% Print Speed: 30mm/s Print Temperature (PLA): 190 C Flow: 100% Print time estimate: 26 minutes for one link   == Assembly Instructions ==  Assembly Time for entire chain: 10-20 minutes:   == Headline text ==   === Common Problems and Solutions === Not being able to snap a link into place onto the existing chain: Place the link that is being added in parallel to the existing link."
