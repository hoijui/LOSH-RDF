    okh:function "Turbines are a much more efficient way to harvest the energy of water in a stream or river than a paddle wheel. A Pelton wheel takes the kinetic energy and harvests it in two ways. It uses the static pressure to push the blades and then uses the added force due to the tangential acceleration of the water around the curve of the blade to harness more power out of the jet. This design is tough to make by hand, but is a lot more efficient than a water wheel. Therefore, using a 3D printer to enable affordable use of this technology in developing nations." ;
