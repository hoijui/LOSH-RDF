    okh:function "A bike is a very useful mode of transportation that many people in first-world countries take for granted. There has been a goal set to create a cheap bike using primarily 3D printed parts. This bike pedal is a good prototype for what the possibilities are for this project. This pedal is fully 3D printed and clips together around a bar/axle. The goal is that this pedal would be easy to switch out and allows for rotation around the axle but not in other directions." ;
