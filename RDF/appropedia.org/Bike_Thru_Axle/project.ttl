    okh:function "This OSAT Project helps multiple goals, primarily goal 10 by helping to make bike transportation more accessible and to decrease the cost and increase the ability to repair a bike that has a broken axle. This part was designed to replace the original axle on my 2017 Raleigh Tokul 3 mountain bike, but could easily be modified to fit any \"Thru\" style bike axle. This part features a hollowed center section to reduce the material used in the print, and otherwise uses a 75% infill for strength. The first iteration used a 50% infill, and due to that and a misplaced thread relief, it was not able to withstand the abuse of being ridden hard. The current model has been ridden and tested thoroughly, and has survived numerous hash riding conditions." ;
