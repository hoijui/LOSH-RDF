    okh:function "This OSAT project is to build upon previous bike fender creations. This is an extension to the \"Duck Flap\" bicycle mud flap. This is intended to cover the gaps that the Duck Flap does not cover and to extend as far as the user can print. This is appropriate for the practical user that is tired of the excess mud and liquids flying onto the user's person while riding a bicycle. Fender has proven to be difficult to print and extremely brittle when printed." ;
