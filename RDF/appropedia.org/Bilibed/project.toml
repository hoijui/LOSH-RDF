function = "== Problem being addressed == Sixty percent of all newborns develop some form of jaundice after birth, and about twelve percent of these newborns need to receive immediate treatment for severe jaundice. If left untreated, severe jaundice can cause life-threatening brain damage. Although this condition can be treated with phototherapy, this treatment method is currently too expensive to be used in low-resource health facilities.    == Detailed description of the solution == Bilibed is a phototherapy treatment option that is cheap, portable, and can be placed next to the mother for follow-up and feeding. The device uses a 30W bulb that has a 1500-hour lifespan."
