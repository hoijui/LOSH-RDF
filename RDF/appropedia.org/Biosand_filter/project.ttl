    okh:function "The BioSand Filter (BSF) is a simple and affordable low-tech water filtration device designed for household use in developing countries. Using sand, gravel, and natural biological processes, the BSF removes pathogens from drinking water. A pathogen is anything that can produce disease. In the case of drinking water, this can include bacteria, protozoa (single-celled organisms), helminths (parasitic worms), and viruses. The BSF relies solely on gravity, not any mechanized or moving parts, making it ideal for off-grid communities." ;
