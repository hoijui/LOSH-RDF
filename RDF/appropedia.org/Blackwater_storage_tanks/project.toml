function = "When urine or faeces cannot be used immediately or transported using a Conveyance Technology (i.e. Jerrycans or oil drums) it can be stored onsite in containers or tanks. The Storage Tank must then be moved or emptied into another container for transport.   === Urine === The Storage Tank should be appropriately sized to accommodate the number of users and the time required to sanitise the urine. Urine collected in small containers (up to 20 litres) can be easily transported and used as fertiliser in the household's own vegetable garden."
