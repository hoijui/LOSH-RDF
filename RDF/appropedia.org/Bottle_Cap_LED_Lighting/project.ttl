    okh:function "Partially prototyped -- needs full test with photovoltaics.. The main goal of this Mech425 project is to design a simple, cost effective indoor light source that can be used in areas of the world that do not have access to electricity or safe lighting at night. If this design proves viable, the technical specifications as well as methodology and costs will be available to anyone who has access to the internet or to programs such as the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) Program. The proposed design utilizes a recycled bottle and cap (with a cap diameter equal to or greater than that of a 2L pop bottle) as a portable, durable platform for a high efficiency LED lighting system that is charged using a small solar panel. The bottle cap will house the lighting equipment and act as the bulb ballast and the pop bottle will act as the diffuser and stand." ;
