function = "I have always been curious about working with natural building and earthen materials. Then as fate would have it I was given the opportunity at Humboldt State University, located in Arcata, CA, in an Engineering course called Appropriate Technology: 305. For Engineering 305 I had to choose a semester project. The co-directors of the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology were just finishing the completion of a strawbale[1] wall and needed someone to plaster the wall. Thus began my sojourn into the use of earthen plaster."
