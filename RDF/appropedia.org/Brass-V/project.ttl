    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Postpartum hemorrhaging is one of the most severe causes of maternal mortality. PPH (Postpartum hemorrhaging) rates in the developed worlds have severely decreased, but they are still a great threat in developing countries. The World Health Organization suggests that there are over 100,000 deaths due to postpartum hemorrhaging every year.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device is classified as one which helps in PPH estimation.  This single use blood collection drape consists of a funneled and calibrated collection pouch that is attached to a plastic sheet, which is placed under the womanâ€™s buttocks immediately after delivery, tied to her abdomen with two belts located in the upper end of the drape, to estimate the postpartum blood loss." ;
