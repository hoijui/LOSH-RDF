    okh:function "Our work provides the foundation for what we hope might become a possible solution for reducing the transmission of HIV from mother to child via breast milk. This report summarizes some of the current research aimed at reducing this transmission and develops several novel approaches to the problem. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate is identified as a promising compound to deactivate HIV in breast milk, though copper filtration and flash heating are also considered. The team is currently working to identify laboratories to test the efficacy of the nipple shield and thus the next step depends on these initial results. For further information, send us an email: team@justmilk.org." ;
