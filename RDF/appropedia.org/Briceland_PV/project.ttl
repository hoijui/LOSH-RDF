    okh:function """This project was to install a photovoltaic (PV) array with sufficient capacity to support all of the household demands, including a electric refrigerator, as well as a wood shop. There is a micro-hydro system on the property as well that delivers power in the winter when the creek is running strongly but can not keep up with demand in the summer when the rains have stopped. For this reason we had to install a power source for the summer months. Briceland gets a lot of sun in the summer, so with the installation of this PV array there is now plenty of power all year-round.   == Getting Started ==   === Array Components === Panels Breaker Box Outback MPPT charge controller Batteries Inverter   === Array stand === Post Array rack   === Array Design === The PV array is made up of 8-120 watt modules so at peak power we should get 960 watts.
