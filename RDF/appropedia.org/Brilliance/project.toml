function = "== Problem being addressed == About twelve percent of newborns worldwide need to receive immediate treatment for severe jaundice. This problem can be solved through the use of phototherapy treatment, but in low cost settings existing phototherapy options are often ineffective, costly, difficult to maintain, and improperly used.   == Detailed description of the solution == Brilliance is an inexpensive, energy-efficient phototherapy device that provides jaundice treatment. While traditional phototherapy machines use compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs, Brilliance uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that last ten times longer. The device has proven to be more effective than traditional devices and costs only $300, a tenth of the cost of other phototherapy devices."
