function = "Bucket-Shower for Developing Countries/Places with no Running Water Countries that are not as developed as the United States and others have access to very little running water, if any at all. This means that not everyone can take a shower or has the means to do so. My solution to this was to design an apparatus that can be mounted to a 5-gallon bucket, or larger, that would be able to convert said bucket into a shower for these countries.   == Bill of Materials == PLA plastic filament 1 Shower Base 1 Shower Head 1 Shower Bolt 1 - 2\" Shower Drain Plug ~5 feet of rope   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Pliers or sharp tool to remove supports   == Skills and knowledge needed == N/A   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions ==   === Printable Stl files & FreeCAD Files === All files available at Youmagine   === Print Instructions === For all printed components Material: PLA Layer Height: 0.25mm Shell Thickness: 0.8mm Fill Density: 10% Print Speed: 85 mm/s Printing Temperature: 200 C Supports necessary (Helps keep the bolt holes circular) Total Printing Time: 15+ hours Assembly time: >5min   === Assembly Instructions === Using the .stl files above print out the following (from left to right)  1 Base 1 Shower Head 1 Bolt  After printing each part of the assembly, take your bucket (assuming one is already owned) and cut a hole in the bottom that is no larger than the base plate. Once the hole is cut, insert the base through the hole, then slide the shower head into the base."
