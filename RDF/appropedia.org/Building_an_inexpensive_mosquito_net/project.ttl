In many developing countries, Malaria represents the biggest threat to infants under 5 years old. It is responsible for 20% of all infant deaths in Africa and kills over 3000 people per day (mostly children). In countries such as Sierra Leone, the second least developed country on earth, Malaria cases account for 40% of medical expenditures, making malaria one of the most expensive preventable illnesses in Africa today. Currently, malaria is a serious medical concern for over 40% of the world population; mostly in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa." ;
