    okh:function "Open source, lightweight, sturdy bulb and seed planter.  The idea of this OSAT is a small, easily producible, hand sized, bulb and seed planter. The current opening fits groupings of seeds or a small bulb, but can easily be sized to fit a larger bulb as well. The interior of the planter is designed to have a ridged blade edge for ripping and tearing into dirt with a twisting motion. As the designers home is currently covered in permafrost, testing has not yet occurred." ;
