function = "== Problem being addressed == Postpartum hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in low-resource settings.  The CAPP (Tire/Pressure Circumferential Abdominal-Pelvic Pressure) device is a simple contraption made of basic, local materials such as bike tires that aims to control postpartum hemorrhage by reducing blood flow to the pelvic organs.   == Detailed description of the solution == The CAPP device consists of three mountain bike tubes that are tied around a woman's waist and legs and function to restrict blood from flowing to the uterus of the hemorrhaging woman. One tube is placed around each leg and one on the lower abdomen/pelvic area.  Each tube is then secured tightly with sheets."
