This project is the second incarnation of a freestanding wall made from natural materials as part of CCAT's greenhouse project. The wall's interior is made from packed beach grass and clay slip. The exterior is a lime and clay plaster which protects the interior of the wall. The project was completed in 2013 and provides the structure and thermal mass for the CCAT greenhouse."
