    okh:function "The composting toilet at the Campus Center For Appropriate Technology (CCAT) was designed by students in Humboldt State's engr215 class. The purpose of project CCATBox was to design a composting toilet system to be used at CCAT in order to save water and recycle the nutrients that were being flushed away. This page will detail the design and use of the CCATBox.   == Background == The CCAT house, located on the Humboldt State University campus in Arcata, CA, is an example for sustainable living and strives to educate the public about appropriate technologies. A composting toilet is an appropriate technology because a composting toilet will recycle human fecal matter, changing a waste into a resource." ;
