    okh:function "== Problem Definition == This page is devoted to documenting the process of building the west wall of CCAT's Greenshed using the natural building method called clay-straw slip. CCAT, or Campus Center for Appropriate Technology is a student run demonstration home at Humboldt State University which showcases the use of appropriate technologies in a residential setting. CCAT is located at the the south end of the Humboldt State University campus in Arcata, CA.  Like many of the technologies featured at CCAT, our clay-straw slip wall was undertaken to fulfill the requirements of our Appropriate Technology class (Engineering 305). Here's a link to an informational video about the construction of the frame for CCAT's Greenshed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owdwpbwe6Xo  Project Members: Carrie Schaden Juliana Willsen Phoebe Sager   == Research == In researching alternative building methods for this project, we discovered that there are very many inexpensive, environmentally responsible, non-toxic alternatives to common modern building methods. We looked into sustainable building methods, such as wattle-and-daub, earthbag, rammed earth, adobe, cob and papercrete." ;
