    okh:function "This page was created by Radical Earth Solutions (RES) Engineering design team on behalf of the DraftMaster appropriate technology clothes dryer design that was created in Lonny Grafman's Engineering 215 class at Humboldt State University (HSU). With Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) as the client, RES was hired by CCAT to produce a new clothes dryer technology to replace CCAT's previous clothes drying technology to a more efficient, durable, low maintenance. After an extensive design process, in one academic semester (12 weeks), RES produced the DraftMaster appropriate technology clothes dryer design for CCAT to use, display, and demonstrate in the CCAT house.   == Background == CCAT was dissatisfied with their current clothes drying technology and requested RES produce a new clothes drying technology. CCAT's past clothes drying technology (as shown to the right) consisted of draping wet clothes from the clothes washer onto a bamboo drying rack and allowing the clothes to dry ambiently." ;
