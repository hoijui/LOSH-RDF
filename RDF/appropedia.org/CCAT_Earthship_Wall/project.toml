function = "The goal of our project was to build a retaining wall with a culinary herb garden for the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) on Humboldt State University. This design is intended to support the growth of annual and perennial plants on a steep incline by creating step-wise levels for them to grow and to collect water and nutrients. The earthship building method is discussed at length here: Earthships Recycled materials such as tires and wood are used with the clay found at the site to shape the swale garden.   == Benefits of Tire Retaining Walls == Freezing and thawing will NOT cause the wall to crack. Moisture passes through the wall without effecting structure, eliminating expensive drains."
