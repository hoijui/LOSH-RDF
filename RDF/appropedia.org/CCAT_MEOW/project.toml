Specifically, this page describes the work that took place on the second version of the trailer (MEOW V2) after the first version was stolen in 2010.   == Background == In December 2010, CCAT lent their Mobile Energy Operations Wagon (MEOW) V1 to a local eco-hostel. While away from the CCAT house, the 720 W photovoltaic (PV) trailer was stolen and vandalized. Some days after the burglary, CCAT received a call from the local police who said they had found the MEOW V1 abandoned on the side of a nearby highway.\nTransport"
