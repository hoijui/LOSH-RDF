function = "== Abstract == The Mobile Energy Operation Wagon (MEOW) is a mobile source of energy for events. It generates renewable energy through the solar panels and the bikes attached to it. Since the MEOW was vandalized in the past, it was in need of new batteries and a change in the position of the battery case. The following project was conducted by a group of Humboldt State University students in the spring of 2015 in order to prolong the life of the new batteries and reestablish the MEOW to working order.   == Background ==  The Mobile Energy Operation Wagon or MEOW is a trailer that has mounted solar panels that generate renewable energy and stores that energy in batteries."
