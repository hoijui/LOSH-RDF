function = "This is the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manual for CCAT mobile energy operations wagon (MEOW). Please refer to it and keep it up to date with any O&M changes.The MEOW was constructed originally in 2003 to showcase solar electric power at concerts and other public gatherings. At these events the bikes are removed from the interior of the trailer and can generate electrical output when used. This power charges the same battery bank associated with the PV system and in turn the system together can power different loads at the event such as the sound system.   == Operation == The following sections describe general operation procedures for the MEOW trailer and PV system."
