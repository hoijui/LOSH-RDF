function = "The CCAT solar photovoltaic system has gone through many changes over the years that it has been used. The current solar panels were always grid-tied, first installed in 2001, ran til 2005, was taken off during the CCAT move, and put back on in 2008. In Spring 2018, after Co-director Anh Bui checked CCAT PG&E bill and checked on the system inverter located in the basement in 2017 that kept blinking \"Waiting on Sun\", it was found out that the inverter has not been functioning properly. A new inverter Fronius Primo 3.8 kW was purchased under the understanding of HSU Contract and Procurement, Facilities Management, and CCAT Co-directors. The inverter was replaced by our local solar experts Solar Roger and Paul Woodworth on 2/29/19 who volunteered their time on a rainy day."
