Parameters analyzed include embedded energy, life cycle cost, system performance, carbon buyback, and a building energy audit.   == Background ==   In May of 1991 CCAT installed a PV solar system. This system ran off the grid for 10 years generating power for the CCAT house along with a wind turbine and backup bio diesel generator. In 2001 a new grid tied PV system of 8 ASE-300-DGF/17 modules of 300 Watts each."
