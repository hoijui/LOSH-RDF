    okh:function "This project is pretty straight forward. CCAT has 6-7 fallen redwood trees in various diameters that are located toward the rear of the property adjacent to the BSS building. CCAT for the past 3 years has without any success been trying to get the logs milled for in-house projects. The management of this project will be divided into 3 phases: removal, milling and kilning (I hope that's a word), and the eventual delivery of usable processed lumber. \"If trees could talk, they would probably be to busy stomping on us.\"   == Criteria == The criteria in which we will rate the success of this project will be on the following:  Locally Milled Top soil disturbance Safety Yield Educational Opportunities Cost   == Project Requirements == The main goal is to get the logs processed into usable lumber." ;
