    okh:function """Slope erosion causes sediment transport in water runoffs that is drained to waterbodies through rainwater sewer. High sediment levels impair aquatic life and reduce water quality. In that context, it is then important to control soil erosion by different methods. Moving the CCAT building to a new location has caused new problems related the topography of the new location and should be addressed.   == Description of Opportunity == The big open space by the concrete slab near the orchard has a sloped section that could need some erosion control.
