    okh:function "The Campus Center of Appropriate Technology is a demonstration house located on the Humboldt State University campus, Arcata, California that is a resource for students and faculty. CCAT has many different technologies on display such as: solar panels, rainwater catchment, organic gardens, a greywater marsh, and an experimental composting toilet, among other things. These projects are on display as educational tools to the community and  information is provided through CCAT/Appropedia on how to recreate these technologies on your own. The Solar Charging Station at CCAT will align with the mission of CCAT to provide education and resources to the community, by clearly expressing how off-grid solar works, while being functional for cell phone/laptop charging.   == Understanding the market == What we have:  10 functioning solar panels donated to CCAT A kiosk in the center of CCAT as a space to set up our system Scrap metal and wood High quality 2 x 4s CCAT tools/hardware Materials for making a guest book Some materials for charge controller housing  What we need:  A sealed battery Charge controller Waytek USB plug for load USB split plug for multiple chargers Copper wire #8 bare, 20 feet Ground rod, 8 feet Acorn nut Panel wire, 8 feet MC 4 branch 10 gauge PV wire MC 4 wire 60 inches cut in half Conduit Battery box Lock for battery box 8 gauge wire from battery to charge controller Fuse block, 10 - 15 Amps near battery  		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		   == Project goals == By the end of the project we want to have accomplished the following goals:  Have a functioning solar charging station at [CCAT][1] Provide an effective demonstration of off-grid solar Complete a step by step guide to construction here on Appropedia for those who want to build it themselves Complete a project report with a cost, buyback time, and energy return on investment analysis Create a prototype and precedent for future such stations on the HSU campus   == Design == Energy calculations: The project location will be the roof of the CCAT demonstration wall kiosk." ;
