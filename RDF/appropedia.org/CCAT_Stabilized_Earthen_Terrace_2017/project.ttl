    okh:function "The scope of this project was to investigate past work on the CCAT earthbag garden terrace at CCAT, identify the best cobb recipe for a project in Arcata, CA, and to begin repairs of the terraces themselves.   == Abstract == The Pacific Northwest climate is humid year round with long seasons of rain. Due to this earthen building projects must be properly prepared for and carried out in order to last for multiple years. Certain Earthbag terraces located at CCAT had been degraded to a level which required repair. Students from a Humboldt State University appropriate technology class were tasked to initiate a repair process and to discover why past attempts had failed." ;
