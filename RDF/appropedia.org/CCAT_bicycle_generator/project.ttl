    okh:function "THE MULTIPLE BICYCLE POWERED GENERATOR. Designed and Built By Bart Orlando At CCAT. This generator preceded the Human Energy Converter and was used one time at the Hog Farm Pignic in 1994. It was built at CCAT. Nine bicycles were held in place with straps and braces made of plumbing pipe fixtures. Arlo Hagler provided help with the electrical wiring. The rear wheel of each bike rested upon a friction drive \"wheel\" made from a fence post peeler core which was drilled through its center and cut in half so that it could be clamped to one of the long drive shafts, each coupled to one of two permanent magnets, 1800 rpm 24v generators. The generators (shown in the lower left corner above) were wired in series to sum their voltages." ;
