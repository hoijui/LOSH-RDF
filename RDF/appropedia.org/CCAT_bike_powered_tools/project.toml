function = "For the Spring 2015 Engineering 305 class at HSU, the bike powered tools team's goal is to make a bicycle powered system to provide an outlet primarily for the use of power tools in the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) tool shed. Currently, CCAT has to use a few extension cords that draw energy from the grid to run their power tools. The bicycle power system uses the energy provided by the rider to charge a battery to be used for power tools. Since a human can usually maintain around 100 Watts of power output for around an hour, a battery is needed to be able to power tools such as a chop saw that needs between 1080-1200 W of power to run. Ultimately, the stationary bike will turn a motor that will charge a battery that will have power tools plugged into an inverter."
