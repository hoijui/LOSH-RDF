function = "The biodiesel refinery at CCAT consists of five stages. The University of Idaho Department of Agriculture in 1991 defined making biodiesel, or transesterification, as the \"process of using an alcohol (e.g., methanol or ethanol) in the presence of a catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, to chemically break the molecule of the raw renewable oil into methyl or ethyl esters of the renewable oil with glycerol as a byproduct (Making Biodiesel).\" The process of making biodiesel will be described in the next three paragraphs.   === Stage 1: Initial Filtering ===  Used vegetable oil from two different restaurants  Simple but effective screens Once the used vegetable oil has been obtained it is filtered through a wire screen to remove all of the food particles. At CCAT we make 30 gallon batches in donated oil barrels (Thanks Spectrum!), and the filtered oil is then poured into a fifty gallon barrel. We begin heating the oil in the barrel to a temperature between 100-120 degrees F using a propane burner.\nFuel generation"
