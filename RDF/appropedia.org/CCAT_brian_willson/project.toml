function = "Brian Willson led a march against the start of the Iraq War in 2003 as it arrived at a protest rally in Eureka, California. The PA system for the event (attended by 4,000 people) was powered by the CCAT pedal powered concert generator. Brian, a veteran of the U.S. war against Vietnam and member of Veterans For Peace, is shown hand-pedaling his custom built trike. It was designed with hand cranks instead of foot pedals. Brian lost both his legs just below the knee during a protest in which he and many others were attempting to halt a munitions train carrying weapons to the Contra (death squads) in Central America."
