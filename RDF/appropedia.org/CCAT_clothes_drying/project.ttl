    okh:function "The purpose of this project was to come up with an attractive, sustainable, and space efficient clothes drying system for HSU's CCAT. With the general goal to help educate and inspire others who seek alternative solutions to everyday waste problems. This project was replaced with CCAT DraftMaster Historically clothes drying has taken place on clothes lines that we could view hanging off peoples balconies throughout the city. This occurred through solar radiation and wind convection causing evaporation. As many energy conservationists may already know, drying clothes in a traditional drier contributes to a large part of the average households energy use.[verification needed] At HSU's CCAT building, three student co-directors reside and have clothes drying needs every week. Since CCAT's main focus is to \"educate the public about the impacts of our technologies on the environment\"  it would seem fitting to design and build a energy free drying system for their washed clothes." ;
