function = "The purpose of a cold box is to create a naturally controlled environment that provides short-term housing for fresh fruits and vegetables. In Arcata, the cold box works best if constructed on the northernmost wall of the home or building, due to our location in the Northern Hemisphere. The cold box is designed to take in cool air from the outdoors through a vent. The air drops through shelves of food and pushes warmer up where it exits through a top vent. The air that circulates through is not only a method of cooling the fruits and vegetables but also removes any of the odors resulting from the ripening process."
