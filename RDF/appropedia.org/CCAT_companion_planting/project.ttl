    okh:function "With the recent completion of CCAT's Raised Garden Beds, CCAT thought it would be an excellent idea to plant companion plants within the beds. Part of my Engr305 project was to design a plan for which plants to plant and to do research to see what plants work well together. CCAT is very excited to have the space for a vegetable garden, as of right now there is no real plot for vegetable cultivation. Companion planting is a beneficial way of growing like fruits and vegetables together. CCAT would like to utilize the small space they have within the Garden Beds to produce as much food as they can." ;
