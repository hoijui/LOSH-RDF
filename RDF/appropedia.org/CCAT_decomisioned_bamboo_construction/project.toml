function = "The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology, needed a way to shelter its vermiculture bins and Biodiesel refinery--but not just any building would do; the co-directors were looking for construction materials that would be in line with their mission to value a healthy planet and to demonstrate living lightly. Alec Cooley, waste reduction manager for Humbolt State University, originally planned to build the shed from Douglas fir, but Derek Toups (a previous CCAT co-director) introduced him to bamboo as a more appropriate building material   === Origin and Purpose === Bamboo is more sustainable than conventional timber. The supply can be maintained without any residual damage; in fact, harvesting at the right time actually helps the plant to grow more quickly in the future.For every crop of timber, a plot of bamboo can be harvested 17 times. The small (15 by 90ft) grove behind the structure, once it has established itself, will produce enough bamboo to replace the entire structure once every year. Since bamboo lasts about 30 to 40 yrs, CCAT will be able to provide bamboo for other alternative construction projects."
