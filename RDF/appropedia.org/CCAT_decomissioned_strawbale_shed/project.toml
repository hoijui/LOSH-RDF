In hopes of using this strawbale structure to demonstrate successful appropriate development to viewers, this web page also includes information about strawbale structure construction in general. If crafted with love, strawbale structures provide economical, energy-efficient, and beautiful shelters that will stand strong on their foundations for centuries. This site attempts to give the viewer, who is hopefully excited about the idea of strawbale construction, resources and links to learn more."
