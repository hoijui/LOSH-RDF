function = "Welcome to the page for the CCAT Earthbag Terrace, located in front of the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology at Humboldt State University. The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) is located near the Behavioral and Social Sciences building on the Humboldt State University campus in Arcata, California. Our original project idea was to build a small informational sign wall to welcome students to the northern entrance to CCAT, and alert readers to upcoming events hosted at CCAT. Due to bureaucratic rigamarole, this project has been changed to a natural plastering project on the CCAT grounds. This project's purpose is to provide a sturdy, natural plaster covering to the EarthBag gardening terrace being built in front of CCAT. This project is to be completed during the Spring 2012 semester of ENGR 305 class by Danielle Burkhart, Morgan Murphy and Cody Hill. The objective of this project is to protect the EarthBag terrace at CCAT from the elements and add an aesthetic element by layering natural plaster over the wall to give it an adobe effect."
