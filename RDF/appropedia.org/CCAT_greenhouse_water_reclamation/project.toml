function = "Humboldt State University's Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) is looking to further increase the sustainability of its practices. CCAT recognized that the water used on plants in its greenhouse was not being utilized to its fullest potential, especially when watering plants on the gardening tables. The water would run off to the ground and sometimes damage the plants that are grown under the tables. A water reclamation system was created to recycle the runoff water and protect the plants that grow below these tables.   == Background == The Four Peppers: Harry Jones, Lauren Virzi, Mario Kaluhiokalani, and Amanda Madden are four spicy Humboldt State University students and creators of the greenhouse water reclamation system at CCAT. CCAT recognized the possibility of recycling water from the gardening tables within its greenhouse by installing a reclamation system."
