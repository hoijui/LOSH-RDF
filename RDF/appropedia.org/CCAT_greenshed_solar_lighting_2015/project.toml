Student staff and volunteers work weekly at CCAT to keep it running smoothly. The Greenshed is a building where the workers store tools and work on small projects. The Greenshed solar panel powers a solar lighting system that workers can use to light the shed at night. The solar lighting system was installed in early 2013."
