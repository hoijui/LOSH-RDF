function = "Spring semester 2017 at HSU, our team of four ENGR305 students were assigned the task of revamping the greywater system located at CCAT. While researching the past project we came to the conclusion that the current system had major problems that needed more than a simple fix. Researching many different forms of greywater systems, it became clear that this three person household didn't need an entire pond, it was oversized. Resulting in the system described to you below, set up with the same basic principles just flowing through a recycled bathtub. Another problem with the previous CCAT system was its inability to provide the campus with educational inspiration. The new installed system is very visible to the daily passerby and its small, above ground components are much clearer to understand."
