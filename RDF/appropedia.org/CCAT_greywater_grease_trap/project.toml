function = "The Campus Center for Appropriate Technologies (CCAT) is a student run organization that promotes sustainability through an environmentally responsible lifestyle. One way they demonstrate their mission to the public is through a greywater marsh system. A typical greywater system reuses effluent from bathroom sinks, showers, and laundry operations. The CCAT greywater marsh system is unique, because it incorporates kitchen effluent into the gray water system. The addition of the kitchen effluent requires the use of a grease removal unit, and a particulate filter."
