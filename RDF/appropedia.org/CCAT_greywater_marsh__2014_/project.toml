This page will record the efforts made by Linsey Payne and Tyler Ebright during the Spring 2009 semester at HSU to research, complete, and provide an end-use for the treated greywater at CCAT.   == Criteria ==   === Existing Conditions ===  The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT)'s greywater marsh we inherited has been an on-going project since 2007 when it was relocated to its current location. It is a subsurface marsh off the southwest corner of the house. The greywater comes from the sinks, the shower, and the laundry machine inside the house. The original design had a settling tank first with a sock filter and a siphon system."
