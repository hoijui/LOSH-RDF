    okh:function "Welcome to the CCAT Greywater Marsh Project Continued! This page will record the efforts made by Linsey Payne and Tyler Ebright during the Spring 2009 semester at HSU to research, complete, and provide an end-use for the treated greywater at CCAT.   == Criteria ==   === Existing Conditions ===  The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT)'s greywater marsh we inherited has been an on-going project since 2007 when it was relocated to its current location. It is a subsurface marsh off the southwest corner of the house. The greywater comes from the sinks, the shower, and the laundry machine inside the house. The original design had a settling tank first with a sock filter and a siphon system." ;
