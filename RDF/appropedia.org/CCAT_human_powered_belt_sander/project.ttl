    okh:function "To many woodworkers, a belt sander is a very important and useful tool that is typically found in woodshops throughout the world. Belt sanders come in all different sizes, models, and styles depending upon the preference of the user. A pedal powered belt sander provides a method of sanding and shaping wood for many different sanding jobs. It will produce a smooth surface on a wood board in much less time than hand sanding. The following design has the basic woodworker in mind, wanting to complete small, non-sophisticated operations, plus the advantage of conserving electricity." ;
