    okh:function "Pedal power is a great way to teach kids how the energy they produce while riding a bike can be used to power entertaining electronic devices. While this writeup is incomplete, hopefully the next team to make kid's bike power for CCAT can use this information. This project began as two separate ideas by two individuals. Both of us; Dana Martin and Julian Klehr, are focused on pedal-power with similar goals, but are both admittedly novices in the field of electricity. We saw this as an opportunity to join forces, share knowledge, and create something even better and more efficient than we each would have accomplished individually." ;
