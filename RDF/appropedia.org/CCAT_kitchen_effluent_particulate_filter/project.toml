function = "The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology contracted our team, The ECO-PLUMBERS through Engineering 215 Intro to Design at Humboldt State University in order to design a filtration system that would remove the particulate matter from their kitchen sink and improve the functionality of CCAT's greywater marsh. To accomplish this, Team ECO-PLUMBERS used the five phases of the design process shown below:  Project Formulation Problem Analysis and Literature Review Search for Alternative Solutions Decision Process Specification of Final Solution As a result of the design process Team ECO-PLUMBERS designed constructed and implemented The Pizza Box a sustainable filtration device that is safe and effective. For more information about the design process and about The Pizza Box please view the document we created while designing the filter: ECO-PLUMBERS   == Background == CCAT is a student run organization dedicated to the practice and teaching of sustainability and appropriate technology. Over the last 31 years, CCAT has demonstrated sustainability and appropriate technology to the students of Humboldt State University and the surrounding community. One aspect of CCAT's practice of sustainability is their use of a greywater marsh to clean household wastewater to use for the irrigation of their landscape agriculture, and to reduce the amount of wastewater entering city sewage."
