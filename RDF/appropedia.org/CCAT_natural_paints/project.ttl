    okh:function """The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California is completely remodeling the inside of their building. When all of the construction is finished the entire interior of the house will need to be painted. As an ENGR 305 project, Spring 2007, Andrea Lanctot and Jill Anderson have decided to make all the interior paints from scratch using safe natural ingredients. The project has four main goals. The first is to research natural paint ingredients, recipes, and techniques.
