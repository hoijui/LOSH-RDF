function = "It has been almost ten years since CCAT has been painted. The last natural paint project was in 2007: CCAT natural paints and since then some of the walls have faded, cracked and chipped. In spring of 2017, students of Engineering 305 researched and developed new natural paint recipes to repaint CCAT. As time has passed, the natural paint of almost a decade prior has faded. We will be using different pigments to create an appropriate paint that adheres to the guidelines of what is considered a natural paint and repaint a certain section within CCAT.   == Team == The 4 person team that worked on this project:  Jonathan Derek Tess Amy   == Problem statement == The objective of this project is to use natural and local materials to repaint CCAT. Through research, development and documentation we will publish our findings and make natural painting more accessible to the general public.   == Project Criteria == The following criteria were determined by spending time with the students living at CCAT. This involved asking for their input directly, observing their interactions with their space, and gauging their reactions to certain aspects from the last project or suggestions from our team."
