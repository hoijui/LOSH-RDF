    okh:function "The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California has an outdoor area that has potential to be utilized and protected better if there was proper rain cover. The team Under One Roof was originally planned to construct the entirety of the roof but due to the COVID-19 Pandemic of early 2020 their plan had to be altered. Under One roof developed two prototypes and a guide book on the best way to move forward with the roof project. Through this page there is a tentative timeline, budget, literature source, construction steps and suggested next steps. These prototypes are meant to be a launching pad to move this exciting new project forward." ;
