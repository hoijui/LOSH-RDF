function = "The pedal powered battery charger was designed and built by Bart Orlando at CCAT in 1996. It can be used to charge a 12v battery. The system consists of an exercise bike placed upon a pedestal as shown in the photo below. A fanbelt raps around the outer circumference of a 40lb - 16\" flywheel and passes through a slot in the top of the pedestal. It then raps around a 2.5\" pulley on a 1800rpm permanent magnet 24dc generator, mounted on the underside of the pedestal."
