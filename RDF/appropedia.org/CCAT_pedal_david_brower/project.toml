function = "In 1993 Bart Orlando began his volunteer efforts at CCAT by receiving permission to pedal power the PA system used at a speech given by David Brower at HSU. A crowd of over 400 people attended the event. The bike with the ape-hanger handle bars is Bart's Bike back when it was still a 15 speed. A friction wheel rolling along the rear tire spins when the bike was pedaled in place, like an exercise bike. The friction wheel was a 2\" diameter skate board wheel, adapted to attach to the 5/8\" drive shaft of the 1/4hp, 24v, 1800rpm permanent magnet DC motor/generator. Because of the relative size of the skateboard wheel and 27\" rear bike tire, the rpm of the generator was approximately 900 rpm."
