function = "The mission of the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) at Humboldt State University (HSU) is to promote the use of appropriate technology through demonstration and education. A popular element of these demonstrations is the decades old use of human and pedal power to complete everyday tasks, such as clothes washing or watching TV. The CCAT Pedal Powered Blender was first designed and built by Bart Orlando with the help of HSU student Saremy Graves in 1997. Since then, it has been a favorite feature of many campus and community events. It has even been featured front and center on the cover of the San Francisco Chronicle. The blender was built by modifying an old exercise bike; the flywheel of the bike turns a skateboard wheel, which is attached to a driveshaft connected to the blender."
