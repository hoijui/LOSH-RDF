function = "The pedal powered/hybrid solar electric lenticular airship. By Bart Orlando, (in memory of Lawn Chair Larry) This is a diagram of a human powered airship. It is shaped like a disc and so can be considered a lifting body. The lenticular/parabolic shape of the airship is very aerodynamic and has a low cross-sectional surface area, reducing the effects of cross-winds. The weight of the vehicle, pilot, passenger and cargo is balanced by internal chambers filled with buoyant helium gas, rendering the vehicle almost lighter than air."
