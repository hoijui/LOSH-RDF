function = "Bart Orlando built his first pedal powered electric generator in 1989 while traveling through New Mexico with the Global Walk For A Livable World. (PHOTO of the Global Walk arriving in New Mexico). It consisted of an exercise bike and a belt driven car alternator. While at the Santa Fe Renewable Energy Fair, Bart met Windy Dankoff who donated a permanent magnet dc generator and explained how it was more suited for pedal power application because it had a much lower rpm rating then the alternator. Windy further explained that alternators were less efficient than permanent magnet generators because a significant portion of the electricity generated by the alternator was used to power an electromagnetic coil within the alternator."
