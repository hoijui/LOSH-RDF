    okh:function "The CCAT pedal power lab was located in the basement workshop of the CCAT house. Bart Orlando began building pedal powered devices there with the assistance of HSU students in the mid - 1990s. Students who worked on pedal powered projects with Bart received class credit in the engineering courses. In 1998 Steve Sakala, Daniel Poten and Bart Orlando co-authored a grant proposal to the Society for Sustainability and Innovation. The grant requested $10,000 for a variety of pedal power projects including the conversion of the basement workshop into the pedal power lab." ;
