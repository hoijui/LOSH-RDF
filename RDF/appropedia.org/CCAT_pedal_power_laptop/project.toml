There is a necessity for appropriate technology to be compatible with high technology. Pedal Power may be the answer to your computer troubles if you are in a geographic area that does not have a dependable electricity source or if you would like to get off the grid. This task is a little difficult because computers are very sensitive to power surges. If you tried to plug your computer right into the generator you would more than likely crash your computer."
