function = "In 1978 a group of students collaborated to create the 'Campus Center for Appropriate Technologies' (CCAT) at Humboldt State University. (HSU) in Arcata, California. CCAT provides many services to the student community at HSU, a few examples are:  providing information about appropriate technologies offering a hands on learning experiences and demonstrating different uses of appropriate technologies in a residential setting With the help of students and the support of the community CCAT was able to acquire the Buck house on the campus of HSU. Since then CCAT has been used as the testing ground for alternative building and energy practices. This project serves as a great educational tool that spans across all age ranges. The bike is equipped with a voltage and amperage meter so more advanced students can calculate power output, while younger students can learn how much energy is needed to power an everyday device like a T.V. When we first approached the project in February 2010 the T.V. was not functioning properly."
