    okh:function """Sure, you can harness energy and cruise around town on a bicycle, but have you ever wondered what else that energy could feed? A human on a bike can produce enough energy to power a laptop, needed lighting, or (with simple connections) a grain mill. While electronic devices require a wired design, a pedal-powered grain mill requires mechanical attachments. And in the spirit of localizing production for self-sustaining communities, the ability to mill grain on a small scale offers independence from corporate and urban production systems.   == Description of Opportunity == At the Humboldt State University Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT), a demonstration house for engineering work and appropriate design projects, there sits a hand-crank grain mill without an easy way to power it.
