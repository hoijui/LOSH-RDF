function = "The pedal powered tablesaw was built by Bart Orlando in 1998 at CCAT, for use in the pedal powered workshop. A Rockwell Delta tablesaw was modified by removing the original off-set 2hp 110v electric motor. In its place, a recumbent excercise bike is used to power the tablesaw via a fanbelt, wrapped around the outer circumference of the bike's 16\" - 40lb flywheel. The fanbelt is also wrapped around a small pulley attached to the driveshaft which spins the circular saw blade. A moderate pedaling effort is required to cut through 1\" thick pieces of wood."
