    okh:function "This is the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manual for CCAT rain water catchment drip irrigation system. Please refer to it and keep it up to date with any O&M changes.   == Operation == The main components of the system are the storage tanks, valves, main line tubing, drip emitter tubing, and the fittings to connect the tubing. Additional components to the system are the soil moisture sensors and mulch. The following guidelines should be followed for optimal use of stored rainwater:  Open valves to initiate water flow Ensure that watering events are timed appropriately (approximately 8 minutes per week) Schedule irrigation activities to occur early in the day to minimize water loss by evapotranspiration Monitor moisture, read outputs from moisture meters in food forest soil to confirm need for watering   == Maintenance == To keep the system functioning efficiently, it is important to check the condition of the drip irrigation lines carefully." ;
