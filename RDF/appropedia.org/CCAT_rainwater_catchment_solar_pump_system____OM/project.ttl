    okh:function "The goal of the operation and maintenance plan for this system in 2019 is to ensure the system fulfills its role in CCAT. The plan is based off the concept of CCAT as a learning laboratory for appropriate technology, meaning that every project must be (a) appropriate, (b) educational, and (c) adaptive. In our conception of appropriate, we require the system to fulfill the appropriate technology (AT) field-specific meaning and align with CCAT’s mission of  helping users to ‘live lightly on the land.,’  But more, it must be appropriate for the specific circumstances of CCAT, in which it must be flexible so future students can adjust or use the system;, it must be educational for CCAT visitors, and it must fulfill its purpose in CCAT. In terms of operations and maintenance (O&M), these mandates mean that the O&M plan must be straightforward, relatively low maintenance, accessible, and carried through multiple CCAT generations.  An overview of the plan is that the system is interacted with in summer, otherwise, the operation of the system is passive - it can catch, pump, and store water by itself.  The maintenance plan has weekly, monthly, and yearly components. The most important part of the maintenance plan is the annual cleaning, which should involve all Co-Directors as it is the main mechanism for the transfer of knowledge across CCAT generations." ;
