    okh:function "Humboldt State University's Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) was started in 1978 and has been going strong since. With three live in students per year, and 18 student employees, CCAT is a \"live in demonstration home\" where the students of Humboldt State University and the local community actively partake in creating and maintaining a home in a sustainable way, by incorporating many aspects of Appropriate Technology. CCAT is in need of a reinstallation of their rainwater catchment system. A system had been installed at the original Buck house, but due to construction and relocation, it was dismantled. With many supplies ready for reuse, and the advantage of hindsight, it is now time to reinstall an efficient and aesthetically pleasing rainwater catchment system." ;
