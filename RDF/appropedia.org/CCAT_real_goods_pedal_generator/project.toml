function = "The real goods - solar living center pedal powered generators. In 1995 Jon Schaffer, the president of Real Goods, approached Bart Orlando at the Hog Farm Pignic and asked if a pedal powered generator like the HEC could be built for display at the Solar Living Center in Hopland, California. When asked how much it would cost, Bart responded that he would build it in exchange for vegetables. Before work began on that project, Real Goods commissioned Bart to build a pedal powered tv/vcr. They paid Bart $1,000 in advance."
