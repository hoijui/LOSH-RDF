    okh:function "The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California wants to incorporate an insect-a-garden on their grounds. This project focuses on CCAT's North-Eastern Slope (see figure below for location). The project includes researching and planting a combination of beneficial and aesthetic plants in order to stabilize the slope as well as attract helpful insects and beautify the area. A retaining wall will be designed and constructed in order to prevent further erosion. As an ENGR 305 project for Spring 2009, Jamila Ghoul and Carolan Raleigh-Halsing have decided to take on this project." ;
