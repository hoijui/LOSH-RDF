    okh:function "In the Spring semester of 2019, our Engineering 305 Appropriate Technology course at Humboldt State University was asked to design the following project as a living and evolving installation of appropriate technologies. The project reflects integrated teamwork, strong communication across the institution, creative problem solving, and over 150 hours of physical labor. Team Rocket Power was assigned the Rocket Mass Heated (RMH) cobb bench on the grounds of Humboldt State University's Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) in front of an existing outside fireplace. CCAT is a student-run instructional home that demonstrates appropriate technology to promote sustainable living and design. The cement foundation and plastered brick chimney will serve as foundation backrest for the bench where the back of the bench will be set directly against the fireplace." ;
