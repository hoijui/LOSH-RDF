function = "This Improved Fuel Stove, or Rocket Stove, is the final project for Engr305 at Humboldt State University. The project goal is to construct a demonstration rocket stove for the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology on the campus of Humboldt State University. The rocket stove will serve as an example of improved fuel stove technology and development; students and public touring the center will learn about the design, function and need for improved fuel stoves around the world. The rocket stove will also enable the residents of the center to cook with traditional biomass, reducing their dependence on petroleum based energy sources. It is important to note that rocket stoves are designed for populations around the world who depend on biomass for their cooking fuel."
