Please refer to it and keep it up to date with any O&M changes.   == Summary == The rocket stove was built in 2007 by an ENRG 305 class using the design principles for improved cookstoves from the Approvecho Research Center. It gets moved about the CCAT grounds, but has recently been moved to a space near the cob oven by the Greenshed. It is heavily rusted and often misused." ;
