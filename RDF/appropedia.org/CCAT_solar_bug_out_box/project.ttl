    okh:function "This project was presented to the group as a learning opportunity for the community through CCAT (Campus Center of Appropriate Technology). The idea for this project was to create a solar-powered box that could charge laptops and phones and other small essential items during times when there is no power or in the event of a disaster. Our group was tasked with creating a reproducible small scale photovoltaic system. Our system was designed to be small enough so that it is easily traveled with and mobile but also large enough to power multiple devices. the system we designed utilized a deep cycle golf cart battery and an 80W repurposed solar panel." ;
