    okh:function "right now, the project has been canceled due to regulations and liability issues with placing a body of water on state property (Humboldt State University).   == Introduction == The CCAT solar heated hot tub will take advantage of the properties of water density.  Anyone who slowly wades into a small body of water on a hot, sunny day will notice the temperature change as they go from the surface to deeper down, with hot water near the surface and cold water below it.  This is due to the convective movement of water, and in our case, eliminates the need for a water pump.  Using this property, I plan to design and build a solar heated hot tub at CCAT using at least one of their solar water heating panels as well as the materials listed under budget." ;
