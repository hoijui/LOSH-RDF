    okh:function "The CCAT solar stereo system was designed and constructed by four students from Humboldt State University during the Spring 2021 semester for class ENGR 305 Appropriate Technology. This project was built for the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) to play music for volunteer days and special events using only solar power. We used a prebuilt bluetooth speaker and powered it using three 15W solar panels. The system is contained in a single structure that can be rolled around for convenient use and storage.   == Background == This project is a solar powered stereo system to be used at the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) at Humboldt State University." ;
