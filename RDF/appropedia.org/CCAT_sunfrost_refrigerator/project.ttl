    okh:function "The locally made Sunfrost refrigerator, running on 12 volt DC electricity, is 600% more efficient than a conventional refrigerator. The three factors that make the Sunfrost more efficient than any other refrigerator are:  The compressor's location The compressor on the Sunfrost rest on the top of the unit, unlike traditional refrigerators which have the compressor located at the bottom of the unit. The advantage to this is that in a traditional refrigerator the compressor generates heat which rises and creates an electric blanket of air around the refrigerator. The Sunfrost has no such problem. Compressor design The small, well designed compressor, lack of fan and low percentage run time all contribute to the Sunfrost's exceptionally quiet operation." ;
