function = "Vertical Garden is a state-of-the-art vertical growing system that is an ecological nutrient recycling system . It's perfect for rooftops, patios, balconies, terracesâ€”just about any relatively sunny place outside. Easy to manage by having a mobile structure and not too heavy, featuring a cylindrical frame which involves multiple sites with plants growing food with a central pipe that is disposed decomposing food remains. The garden tower is highly practical because it combines several benefits at the same time. By using food remains to feed the compost-nutrient delivery system vermi integrated, thereby contributing to the reduction of waste food and litter, and consequently lower consumption of purchased food."
