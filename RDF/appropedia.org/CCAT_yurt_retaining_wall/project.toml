function = "Hello, and welcome to our Spring 2013 Appropriate Technology project at Humboldt State University (HSU). Our team is comprised of Ivan Diankov and Alex Kato. We will be designing and constructing an erosion control system on the slope behind the CCAT yurt house at HSU's Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT). Erosion control and slope management come in many forms. From retaining walls to bio-engineered erosion control (BEC) techniques, there are various methods to maintain and control a hillside."
