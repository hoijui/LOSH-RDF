    okh:function "The CCAT Yurt was designed as a place where students and community members could come in and achieve a sense of relaxation. It fits in quite well at CCAT for its educational space for appropriate technology. The roof of the yurt has undergone some renovation in order to reduce it's impact on the environment, and add some aesthetic significance to it. Time has taken its toll on the yurt, and there is visible wear and tear to the roof. The roof has begun to leak and this could lead to damage inside." ;
