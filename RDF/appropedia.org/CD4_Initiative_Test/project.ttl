    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == The vast majority of patients needing diagnosis and treatment for HIV infection live in rural areas of developing countries. There is a need for a CD4 counter that does not require a laboratory or expensive equipment. The test will assist healthcare workers in district hospitals and health centers of developing countries to make clinical decisions in the management of antiretroviral therapy.   == Detailed description of the solution == The CD4 Initiative Test is a rapid and robust, point-of-care diagnostic to count CD4 T cells in adults living with HIV or AIDS in resource-poor countries. Specifically designed to be used in peripheral health centers, the test will be used to aid diagnosis of HIV or AIDS patients as well as for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy." ;
