function = "The goal of this design is to allow a lubrication and chip clearing module addition to a CNC router. This system consists of an external unit which served to feed the air and lubrication with an actuating arm mounted on the spindle to better direct the fluid/air onto the tool piece. This simple and easy solution would allow individuals to use their CNC Router with metal.   == Bill of Materials ==   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Soldering Iron to use filament welding method to connect parts Use solding iron to melt filament together. A short piece can be ran through holes and melted on either end."
