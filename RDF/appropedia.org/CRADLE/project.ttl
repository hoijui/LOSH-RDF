    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Women in resource-limited settings are seven times more likely to develop pre-eclampsia than women in developed countries. Regular blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a cost-effective means of identifying such hypertensive diseases in their early stages. However, medical facilities in resource-limited settings lack the ability to take accurate BP measurements.   == Detailed description of the solution == CRADLE is a cheap, automated blood pressure monitor that is a feasible and sustainable solution to accurately measure blood pressure in rural antenatal clinics. The device generates reliable results and requires minimal training, and also features a prolonged battery life." ;
