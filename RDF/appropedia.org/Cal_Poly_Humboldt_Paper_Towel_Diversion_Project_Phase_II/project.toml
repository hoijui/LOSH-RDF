function = "The 2012 Spring semester class of Engr370 Energy, Technology and Society continued the 2011 Cal Poly Humboldt Paper Towel Diversion Project. Phase II of the project culminates in a memorandum of understanding supported by documented research. This document asks participating stakeholders to take a vested interest in the project. The memorandum is not meant to be contractual but rather a step towards an easy facilitation of the project through understanding and agreement to the proposed elements of the project. The document is supported by further research into an effective paper towel collection system and a community based social marketing plan to change social norms on the campus."
