function = "All modern vehicles have a center consol that can charge your electronic devices. This is all very convienient becuase everyone is always looking for a charger. However if the driver is attempting to plug in his or her phone they often times need to travel through what seems like Narnia to find the USB port. Then once they finally find the USB port it'll be their luck that it is upside down. This product brings out these ports and makes it mindless to plug in cables while driving."
