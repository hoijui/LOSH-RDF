    okh:function "This page lays out the steps required to convert your current Delta Athena II printer to reduce the rattling of the connecting rods during printing.   == Design and Printing ==   === Design === This is a relatively simple design, meant to cover the plastic bags which are actually doing the sound dampening. The plastic parts cover the plastic bag so it doesn't interfere with other components of the printer and the rubber band holds the covers stable.   === Printing === These can typically print with no problem, with printing at 20% infill at a speed of 140 mm/s and layer size of .15, this design costs about 20 grams per cover and about 120 g overall. To avoid too tight of a gap on the printed parts, print at about a scale of 110% if you're having problems with getting the parts to slide over the plastic bags after wrapping the connecting rods." ;
