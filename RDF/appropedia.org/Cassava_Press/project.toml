function = "A Cassava Press, or a general food press, is a tool used in many parts of the developing world for increasing the longevity of food by pressing part, or all of the liquid out of the food. Many cassava presses are very large (about the size of a washing machine) and allows for the village people to preserve a large amount of food at once, either for personal use or to sell in their micro-economy setting.[1] The cassava press designed as a piece of open source hardware is a small scale press that could be used in a household, or for personal use if needed. Additionally, with minor design changes the press design could be adapted for other uses, such as for pressing ash to form activated carbon filters for use in rudimentary water filters.   == Bill of Materials == 3D Printed Parts Cassava Cylinder File:Cassava cylinder.stl File:Cassava cylinder.scad Cassava Nut Plate (optional) File:Cassava nut plate.stl File:Cassava nut plate.scad Cassava Top File:Cassava top.stl File:Cassava top.scad Cassava Handle (optional) File:Cassava handle.stl File:Cassava handle.scad Cassava Plunger File:Cassava plunger.stl File:Cassava plunger.scad Purchased Parts 5 1/4-20 nuts 5 1/4-20 wing nuts or standard nuts 5 1/4-20 x 7.5in threaded rods 3 1/2-16 nuts (jam nuts if available) 1 1/2-16 threaded rod (at least 6 inches)   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Specifications and assembly instructions == Once all pieces have been printed (~12 hours) or purchased, the press is ready to be assembled (15 minutes)by following the steps below.   === Common Problems and Solutions === When customizing parts make sure that: holes are given proper tolerances appropriate to the printer being used proper thickness is used where needed to ensure strength (depends on food being processed) screen size that is used is appropriate for the food being processed   == Cost savings == While the food press can be used for many different foods, there are not many commercial equivalents for \"home\" use."
