function = "Traditionally in many parts of Oaxaca and especially in the central valleys, roofs were made from successive layers of reeds, clay and tile hoisted on thick log supports. The system is excellent in terms of insulation and wind resistance, however it can encourage the proliferation of pests and needs to be regularly maintained and replaced. In response people have started to use cardboard, tar, and cement instead of clay for their roofing. A cheap and effective alternative is the use of milk containers or other liquids, known commercially as \"tetra pack.\" These containers are waterproof and are composed of cardboard pressed to plastic and aluminum, making them unrecyclabe in most places. Though they can not be recycled they can be reused as great insulation, as well as resistant and durable material for roofing and other building needs."
