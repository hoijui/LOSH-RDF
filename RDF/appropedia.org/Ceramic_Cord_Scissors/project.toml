function = "== Problem being addressed == Right after childbirth, infection is a large problem during the cutting of the umbilical cord for both mother and child. 277,376 neonatal deaths alone attributed to tetanus in 1997 according to the World Health Organization, which are due to improper sterilization of the cutting tool. Additionally, there is a high cost associated with the use of disposable scalpels, which may encourage developing nations to reuse them and thus perpetuate the risk of infection.   == Detailed description of the solution == The device is a pair of ceramic scissors which is easily sterilized. The device is expected to reduce the risk of infection related to tetanus and other diseases due to improper sterilization of disposable scalpels or using a rusty scalpel."
