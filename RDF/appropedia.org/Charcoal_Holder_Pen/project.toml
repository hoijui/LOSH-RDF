function = "This is a pen that will hold charcoal for an artist to use. From what I found in my research there aren't many holders out there for pens and of the pen holders they're usually about 77 dollars and are found online from specialty stores.[1] This makes it very difficult for those in developing countries to have such a holder. This pen is apart of the OSAT movement because of this. I could see this pen being printed for students in art classes around the world, giving them the opportunity for mess free sketches.The pen will keep the canvas that they are using free from excess smudges where the charcoal would have made their hands messy. Having the charcoal in a well-protected space it will keep the canvas and the artist safe from the mess."
