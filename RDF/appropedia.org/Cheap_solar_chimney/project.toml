function = "This solar chimney can be made with low cost materials and a little labor. It has no moving parts. The sunnier the day, the more effective it is.   == The principle == A black painted, 150 mm diameter metal tube stands out of the roof, 6 to 8 meters high; the air inside gets hot and rises creating an airflow which draws cool air into the building, possibly through an Evaporative cooler.   == Making it == In order to have the air swirling (to improve heat transfer between the air and the pipe) you also need a slotted cylinder 200-300 mm in diameter, welded to the bottom of the black tube."
