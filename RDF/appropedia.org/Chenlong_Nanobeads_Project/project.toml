function = "For full details see MethodsX paper: Fabricating Ordered 2-D Nano-Structured Arrays Using Nanosphere Lithography  cleaning: Si wafer or glass should be cleaned using a modified piranha cleaning process, specifically, H2O2: NH4OH: H2O = 1: 1: 5, 1' x 1' wafer soaked into the solution mixture and heated to 110 C for about 1 hour. Then the wafers rinsed in DI water and dried in N2 flow. Stored in DI water before use, note that it can't be stored in DI water for more than a week, cleaned it again if a week elapsed from last cleaning beads deposition: the beads solution should be first ultrasonic for 30 minutes, be sure to put the suspension at the center of the ultrasonic bath (or other position gives the strong vibration, based on your observation). Move to clean room to use the spinner for beads deposition. The recipe for monolayer on silicon or glass:1' x 1' wafer placed at the center of the spinner wafer holder, set the speed = 8000rpm, accel = 800rpm, time = 2min."
