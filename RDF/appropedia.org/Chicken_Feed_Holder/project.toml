function = "Most people in the developing world are engaging in poverty alleviation projects such as small-scale farming (irrigation based), poultry and small flock livestock (goats, pigs and ships). Poultry is proving to be among the most popular projects for villagers since returns can be realized within a short period of time (approximate 6 - 8 weeks).,. Most of these projects have failed due to diseases outbreaks which results in high poultry fatalities,poor production performances (eggs,slow growth rate, etc), financial loss to farmers and human infections. Almost all the chicken diseases are transmitted through contaminated chicken feces and other fluids discharge. Appropriate chicken feed holders can help keep feed isolated from being contaminated by feces and hence makes minimizes the outbreak of diseases."
