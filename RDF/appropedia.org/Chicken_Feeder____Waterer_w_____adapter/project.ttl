    okh:function "This is a baseplate for a poultry feeder and waterer, which a gallon jug would be used as the hopper. This solution provides safe, short-term storage for either poultry feed or water that will fill the feeder when it begins to run low. This also allows for chickens to be well fed/watered and allow for the owner to refill the feeders less often, allowing them to tend to other responsibilities. A gallon jug is easy to fill with the desired feed, and is easy to screw into the baseplate.   == Bill of Materials == Printed Parts:  Feeder or Waterer Other Materials  Plastic Gallon Jug Poultry Food or Water Files:  FreeCAD and STL files can be found here: Youmagine Chicken Feeder and Waterer FreeCAD Feeder: File:Admitche feeder.FCStd FreeCAD Waterer: File:Admitche waterer.FCStd   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Knife to cut hole into the top of the milk jug (if desired, feeder only)   == Skills and knowledge needed == Basic 3D printing skills Basic CAD skills to adjust threads if necessary   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Download the STL file from above (Bill of Materials, admitche_feeder.stl OR admitche_waterer.stl) Convert the STL to a gcode file using Cura ." ;
