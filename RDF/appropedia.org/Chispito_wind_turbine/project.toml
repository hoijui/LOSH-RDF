function = "The Chispito wind turbine or \"Chispito Wind Generator\" is a simple DIY HAWT wind turbine. It is primarily used as an educational project for those interested in wind turbine construction, and generates little power so as to allow actual use in off-grid homes.   == Charisteristics and construction == Most of the parts can be sourced in junk or salvage yards, and the construction requires minimal tools and skills. The project is designed to be open source and simple to create and maintain. Chispito can produce 100 watts in a 30 mph wind."
