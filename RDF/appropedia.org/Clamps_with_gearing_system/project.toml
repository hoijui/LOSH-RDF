function = "A clamp is used in many stages of manufacturing and assembly. Holding things in place during these processes will yield higher quality parts and enable more complicated pieces to be built. By using a geared system, much more force can be placed on objects compared to an un-geared clamp. Cost efficient and expandable geared clamps will help enable growth in technologically deficient countries.   == Bill of Materials == The clamping system is made up of the rack, and clamps."
