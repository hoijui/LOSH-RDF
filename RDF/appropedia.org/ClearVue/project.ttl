    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Maternal deaths in low-resource settings can oftentimes be prevented if women had access to antenatal care during pregnancy. Ultrasound imaging is especially useful to make accurate diagnosis for first trimester conditions such as ectopic pregnancy or gestational trophoblastic diseases. Many health centers in low-resource settings do not provide imaging equipment to provide screenings leading up to the birth, which ultimately leads to an increase in infant mortality.   == Detailed description of the solution == ClearVue is a group of ultrasound equipment that provide cost effective yet high quality imaging that will allow clinicians to examine pregnant mothers during the term of their pregnancy. The device has a lightweight, modular, and energy efficient design, with low energy needs and easy serviceability." ;
