    okh:function "A RepRap 3D printer hanging from the ceiling. The RepRap project first showed the world cheap small scale 3D printing in 2006. Their design was intentionally not very well thought out. The idea was that a 3D printer that could print its own parts would be improved through evolution like iterations, no matter the quality of the first design. This turned out to be quite correct, as a large community quickly grew around the first few RepRap designs." ;
