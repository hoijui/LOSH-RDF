function = "This page summarizes life cycle assessment (LCA) studies that focus on how cloth and disposable diapers differ in cradle-to-grave impacts. Life cycle analysis follows resource consumption and environmental impacts from a product's \"cradle to grave\", meaning, from the product's creation to disposal (Figure 1). Every diaper type has differing associated impacts for production, use, and disposal. Impacts are broken into four categories: water consumption, energy consumption, raw materials consumption, and solid waste. Raw materials consumption describes natural and man-made resources needed for production of the diaper type and solid waste describes specific impacts related to disposal of diaper type."
