Club foot is a congenital, physical deformity that is characterized by infants being born with a foot turned inward or to the side. It is easily and typically treated in developing countries, but in rural, developing areas where treatment options may be less available, club foot can lead to life-long disability. It has been estimated that prevalence of clubfoot in Africa is approximately 2 in 1000 births [1] and as high as 8 in every 1000 births in East Africa [2]. This project was inspired by conversations with Kenyan orthopedics specialists that occurred in Kisumu, Kenya in 2016." ;
