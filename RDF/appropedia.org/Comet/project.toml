function = "== Problem being addressed == Twelve percent of newborns need to receive immediate treatment for severe jaundice. This problem can be solved through the use of phototherapy treatment, but in low-income settings existing phototherapy options are often ineffective, costly, difficult to maintain, and improperly used.   == Detailed description of the solution == Comet is a low-cost, high-performance, and compact jaundice treatment device intended to be used in rural clinics or as a backup for urban hospitals. This device is a cheaper, smaller and more energy-efficient device than Brilliance, another phototherapy device developed by the same design team. Comet utilizes high intensity light-emitting diodes (LEDs) which provide the intense blue light to treat jaundice."
