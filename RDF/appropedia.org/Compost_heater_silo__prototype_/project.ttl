    okh:function "This article describes the prototype of a compost heater silo, which is the heart of an internal Compost heater, in an early development state. The prototype on the photograph on the right has been build by modifying a usual rainwater tank (polyethylen). It is 1.80 m high at a volume of 300 liters. This is too small for a substantial contribution for the heating requirements of a regular dwelling house, however its purpose is the analysis and optimization of the system's behavior, a feasibility study. The prototype has an inlet for the biomass and an outlet for the resulting compost." ;
