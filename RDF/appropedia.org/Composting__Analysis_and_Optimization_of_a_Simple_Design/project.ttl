    okh:function "Composting is defined as the biological decomposition and stabilization of organic material. The final product of such a process should be free of pathogens and weed seeds, and of sufficient quality that it can be applied to land without adverse environmental effects. At the most basic level, composting requires virtually no additional materials, structures, or work, so it has the inherent properties of an appropriate and sustainable technology. The extent to which materials, labor, and knowledge are appropriately applied toward the refinement of a composting process ultimately determine its efficiency and effectiveness, however, this should not be taken to mean that complexity and efficiency are mutually dependent.The design proposed herein outlines an effective method by which composting of yard and food waste will produce humus that can be spread directly on crops as a soil conditioner, immediately increasing yield.   == Introduction == Many forms of composting exist, ranging from backyard piles to complex industrial processes." ;
