    okh:function "According to Construction in Africa, investors are looking to invest $100 billion dollars in the infrastructure of Africa per year starting in 2013 in the next decade. A way to put this money to use in the developing continent and to save money in the building of infrastructure, 3D printers could be used to make tools more available and cheaper. One tool is the concrete trowel which could be 3D printed as a cheaper method for smoothing out concrete walls and plaster on walls for the building of infrastructure in developing countries. This trowel would help fulfill the needs of affordable tools for concrete and interior work on houses and buildings in developing countries. Also the light weight of a 3D printed trowel would ease the strain on the wrists of construction laborers." ;
