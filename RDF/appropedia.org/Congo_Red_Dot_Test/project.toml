function = "== Problem being addressed == Preeclampsia is pregnancy-induced hypertension, or high blood pressure, and is associated with high protein levels in the urine. While high blood pressure is the most distinguished sign of the disease, it is also linked to damage in several organs such as the kidneys, liver, and endothelium. There is a critical need in the developing world for low-cost diagnostics for preeclampsia. Preeclampsia occurs in as many as 10% of pregnancies, usually in the second or third trimester, and after the 32nd week. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when preexisting disease such as hypertension is present."
