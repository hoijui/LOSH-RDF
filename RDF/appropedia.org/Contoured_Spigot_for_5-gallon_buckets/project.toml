function = "Spigots manufactured for self-attachment typically rely on large gaskets to maintain a seal, which works with varying success on the curved surface of a bucket. By modeling a bucket with just its top and bottom diameters and its average thickness, it's easy to design a spigot with contours that fit well. This design is expected to fit a wide range of bucket sizes effectively. The main attachment is reasonably easy to print, and typical modification requires changing only 4 parameters in two files.   == Bill of Materials == OpenSCAD & the files located at http://libre3d.com/category/655/Plumbing/listings/800/Parametric-Contoured-Spigot-for-5-gallon-buckets.html  Appropriate feedstock for printer - be aware that some plastics like PLA absorb water readily Will likely require a gasket of some sort between outer section and bucket - 3.5cm gasket or flat rubber cut to size will probably be sufficient   == Tools needed for fabrication == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Tools necessary to make 3.5cm hole in bucket   == Skills and Knowledge Necessary == Need to know top and bottom outer diameters of bucket, average thickness of bucket, and desired height of spigot - scripts will do the rest, assuming no other changes to geometry Useful site for bucket dimensions: http://fivegallonideas.com/5-gallon-bucket-dimensions/    == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Like many interlocking parts, especially those with threads, this is sensitive to print quality - use 100% fill, a reasonable layer thickness, and printing speed Expect total print times for the whole assembly between 3-5 hours - obviously dependent upon print parameters Assembly time is negligible, expect drilling the bucket to take longer Be sure to orient prints for slicing in a sane manner - flat ends down, etc."
