    okh:function "The basis for this project was a component of a semester long team project at Michigan Tech to design, develop, and test a robot of our own imagination. Our team decided on creating a grilled cheese making robot, and as part of that a circuit board to control the robot was necessary. The electrical design for the board was simple in concept-- create a board capable of controlling 3 separate stepper motors and a resistive heating device, while taking in human input, mechanical positions, and thermal readings (to allow for closed-loop control). This could be accomplished (and was accomplished) quite easily using a microcontroller with pulse width modulation capabilities and a few breakout boards for stepper motor control.   == Design ==  Pictured above is the finished schematic for Mr." ;
