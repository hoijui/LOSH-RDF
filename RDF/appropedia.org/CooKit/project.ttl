    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Cholera is a growing epidemic in many places in the world with limited or no access to clean water. Cholera, and other waterborne infections, can be effectively prevented by pasteurization, but many current devices are costly, or require fuel or electricity.    == Detailed description of the solution == CooKit is a commercial solar-powered cooker. It is composed of cardboard and foil in a shape that most efficiently reflects sunlight. A heat-resistant bag must be placed around the pot in order to retain heat." ;
