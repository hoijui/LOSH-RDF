function = "Humboldt State University engineering students working with community groups to design, build and plant a system for growing potatoes above ground at Abuelita's Demonstration Garden in Eureka, CA. The structure uses materials sourced and/or donated from local businesses and partners in attempt to encourage communities to become more self-sufficient by growing their own food. The team put on a follow-up workshop for community members that consisted of a miniature replica of the permanent structure showing that food can be produced independently and at home, even with a limited amount of space.   == Background == During the spring semester of 2018, students from the Engineering 305 Appropriate Technology class at Humboldt State University implemented a vertical food growing operation in Eureka, California. The project is in conjunction with Cooperation Humboldt and Redwood Community Action Agency as a directive to increase community access to local and healthful food. The mission statements of these local organizations align with the values that we hold as active community members."
