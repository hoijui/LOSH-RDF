    okh:function "Steven Covey's stuff is about developing 'habits' that can make us more effective in whatever life-goals we are trying to achieve. A lot of the stuff was derived from a 'business' model, and is a bit 'American' if you know what I mean -- you'll find Covey's books in the 'Business & Management' section of WH Smith as well as the 'self- help' section -- which made me quite resistant at first -- but if you too harbour those sort of prejudices it's worth overcoming them and checking out his Seven Habits of Highly Effective People where you will find much that can be transfered to permacultural practice.   == Summary == Most of us (by 'us' I mean society at large) have learned habits through our culture, upbringing, etc that tend to make us ineffective, we tend to focus on problems, get caught up with 'negative' campaigning, don't manage our time effectively, behave competitively, etc, etc. Covey argues that just as these 'bad' habits have been learned and become ingrained, we can learn and develop 'good habits' that increase our chances of being effective within our lives, and in achieving both personal and public 'victory'.  HABIT 1; Be proactive, or 'seek to act before you are acted upon'." ;
