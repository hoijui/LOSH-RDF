function = "Crawler Harnesses can be cumbersome to keep in your tackle box without a holder and more often than not, if you're walleye fishing, you have a tackle box FULL of crawler harness holders just to keep up. Instead of buying out Dick's Sporting Goods, or not having a place to buy these holders nearby and getting them all tangled, why not print one of your own? This 3D printable crawler harness holder just needs foam or cork to make it very useable as it is a very easy print. Link to .STL and FreeCAD Files can be found here   == Bill of Materials == 28m of filament- $1.68 ($20 MatterHackers Build Series and about 330m per kg so $0.06 per meter) 1 Tube of super-glue- $0.59 1 square foot of foam or cork- $1.30 (4 pack is $5.19 on Amazon) Total: $3.57 or about $0.43 cheaper than a standard one   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Cutting tool such as scissors or a knife   == Skills and knowledge needed == 3D printing   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Make sure one end is down on the build plate when slicing, no support should be necessary I printed this at 80 mm/s with 25% fill and 0.6mm wall thickness, it shouldn't need to be any stronger or more precise Keep the layer height small to avoid the need for supports. I would recommend 0.2mm layer height Print should take about 2.5 hours depending on your speeds, infill, wall thickness etc."
