    okh:function "The amount of plastic waste being accumulated on a daily basis is higher than ever, which raises the problem of plastic collection, transportation, and processing. The idea of this project is to make a tool that breaks the plastic down into smaller pieces so as to make it easier for transportation as well as further processing. An ideal outcome of this project would be a compact plastic shredder, which can easily be used even at remote places.   == Understanding the market == This is where you can describe what already exists, what is needed, etc. You may want to include inline references." ;
