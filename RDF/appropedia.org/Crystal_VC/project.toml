function = "== Problem being addressed == Cholera continues to be a major cause of illness and death in developing countries, especially in post-natural disaster or post-conflict settings. In these settings, laboratory diagnosis of cholera may not be possible due to lack of electricity and trained personnel. Timely diagnosis is essential for appropriate treatment.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Crystal VC dipstick test is an immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic test for cholera, which detects cholera strain-specific antigens in human fecal samples. It is highly sensitive and specific for detecting both O1 and O139 strains."
