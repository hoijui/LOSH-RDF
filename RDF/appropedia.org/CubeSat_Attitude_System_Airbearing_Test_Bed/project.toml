function = "Goal of this project is a design of a tool for attitude system testing for CubeSat class of satellites. It is based on the airbearing principle. Satellite is to be placed and secured inside an enclosing sphere. This sphere is then to be placed on the tool's platform part, which is connected to the source of compressed air, that it distributes to the nozzles. The nozzles are positioned tightly on the sphere surface and create thin air layer in between them."
