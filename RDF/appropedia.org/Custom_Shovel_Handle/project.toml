function = "This is a shovel handle to either replace broken ones, or add one in where the shovel/hoe/whatever tool has only the wooden handle. Grips such as these can offer not only greater leverage but also comfort and wrist relief preventing long term injuries such as carpal tunnel. Due to tools having different diameters and users wanting different sized grips, everything about this has been mapped to easily changed variables which require only the easily measured constants inputted; all the trigonometry for the supports with be automatically adjusted. The number and placement of screw holes and also thickness and length of the section that overlaps the shovel can also be easily altered to user preference for strength.   == Bill of Materials == 2-6 screws to connect grip to shaft screwdriver File for removing support residue Scad and STL files available here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:555240   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == Nothing more than basic 3D printing and altering well commented variables to get desired size required   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == I used Openscad for the model, Cura for the slicer, and Pronterface for the controller  Open the .SCAD file in Openscad, and adjust the given parameters to fit your needs."
