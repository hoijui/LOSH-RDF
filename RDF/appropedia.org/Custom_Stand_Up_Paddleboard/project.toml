function = "== Members ==  Cleyton Cavallaro Christopher Grace David Swanson   == Background == The Custom Stand Up Paddleboard project is part of Michigan Technological University's BoardSport Technologies Enterprise. It is a senior capstone project that aims to develop a cheap and open source method for manufacturing top of the line paddleboards.   == Materials and Techniques ==   === Epoxy ===  Epoxy was chosen as a layer of Solarez epoxy between foam and fiber. This layer will give a more resilient layer to help with adhesion. Solarez epoxy does not harden fully, but remains a tacky epoxy to help give these properties."
