function = "Biking is not only an enjoyable hobby or exercise, but a practical and sustainable way of getting where you need to go. Biking at night can be especially dangerous which is why many places require a light to be mounted to the front and back of any bicycle. These lights can be needlessly expensive, so I designed a customizable mount that can be used with any standard flashlight. This, paired with the many other parts designed by my colleagues, will allow anybody to print their own bicycle, making for a cheap and sustainable method of transportation.   == Bill of Materials == Flashlight .013 Kg of filament Part Files: File:Light Mount.scad, File:Light Mount 2.scad STL Files: YouMagine M3 Nut and bolt M3 Hex Wrench   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer M3 Hex Wrench   == Skills and knowledge needed == Basic knowledge of 3D printing   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Print Specifications: Material: PLA Layer Height: 0.1 mm Wall/Top/Bottom Thickness: 0.8 mm Infill: 15% Extrusion Temperature: 200˚C Print Speed: 60 mm/s Support: Everywhere at 50˚ Bed Adhesion: Skirt Print time estimate: 1 Hour 35 Minutes Assembly Instructions: Place snap-fit rings in base mount slots."
