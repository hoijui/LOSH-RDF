    okh:function "There was a request to design a customizable shovel handle. A previous student designed one years ago and I was not impressed with the design or that I was not able to customize it on thingiverse. I remade it with a different design and made the shaft diameter and the length of the grip variable. Printing a shovel handle is an easy way to ensure you are getting what you need and my design will make sure it is also comfortable in your hands.   == Bill of Materials == OS compatible 3D printer 2- M6X140 bolts 2- M6x1.0 standard nuts https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3263057%7C necessary files to download here   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer M6 screwdriver   == Skills and knowledge needed == None!" ;
