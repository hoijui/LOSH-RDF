function = "== Problem being addressed == There is a severe shortage of trained health care workers in developing nations and this has tremendous implications for maternal health.  Pregnant women are encouraged to travel to health care facilities to have safe deliveries; however, their health is often compromised in the hands of inadequately trained birth attendants.    == Detailed description of the solution == D-Tree has developed a mobile health algorithm to be used by healthcare workers that will aid them in effectively assessing labor and delivery, accurately detecting complications, and arranging and paying for transportation to a health facility.  Electronic protocols guide healthcare workers through a series of questions that ultimately lead to a diagnosis and treatment.  These protocols allow healthcare workers to conduct proper antenatal care checkups, encourage facility delivery, and provide specialized counseling regarding healthy behaviors and nutrition and family planning as well."
