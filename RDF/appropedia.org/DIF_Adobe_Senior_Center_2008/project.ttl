    okh:function "The construction of the DIF senior center in Parras began in 2006 after DIF approached Humboldt State University to request assistance with the project. DIF hopes to provide a center for activities for the elderly within the community; this stems from a desire to physically and mentally stimulate the elderly community of Parras in order to promote healthier lifestyles. This yearÂ´s work will involve finishing the pouring of the foundation for the kitchen, which was added to the floor plan last year. Also, this year will entail constructing the kitchen walls with adobe, leveling out the partial walls that were built in past years, building up the walls to a greater height, minor repairs for problems caused by weathering, and completion of the structure, including the roof. This is the third year that the Humboldt State University Appropriate Technology Program in Parras has worked on this project." ;
