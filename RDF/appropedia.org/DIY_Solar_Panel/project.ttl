    okh:function "The purpose of this Solar Panel project is to show how to construct a solar panel by yourself at home, that produces enough power to charge any small devices or a small battery. The idea to build a solar panel by myself came about as my final project for my alternative energy systems class. Originally the plan was to build a solar panel that would charge the batteries on an electric bike, however there were a few set backs. The biggest one being the amount of power needed to charge the batteries exceeded the amount of solar cells that were bought. Therefore the project turned into a learning experience with a couple roadblocks and of course solutions that eventually led to a solar panel that produces enough energy to charge a smaller battery or a device." ;
