function = "It's a lot of fun hauling cargo around on a bike. A bike trailer can make a bicycle more practical for transporting groceries, laundry, friends, etc. One of the least-expensive bike trailer designs out there, all that is needed to build this backpack-frame bike trailer is an old external-frame backpack, 18 feet of metal conduit, and some other hardware (see materials). The prototype trailer was designed and built by Russell Kramer, who also brought us the Sunny Brae Yurt. This Appropedia article is by Aaron Antrim with Russell's help."
