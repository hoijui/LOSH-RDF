    okh:function "The amount of materials present in our waste stream grows everyday with only a fraction of these materials reclaimed through current recycling establishments. The objective of Humboldt State University and our group \"The Trailer Park boys\" in the Engineering 215 Introduction to Design class is to creatively upcycle materials in order to construct a bike trailer. The bicycle trailer will then be utilized by SCRAP Humboldt as an environmentally friendly alternative to collect and transport additional reusable materials back to Scrap Humboldt. SCRAP Humboldt is a non-profit organization that strives to educate the local community about effective and imaginative reuse of waste materials through projects, as well as provide easy access to reclaimed materials. Being one of five creative reuse centers that are a part of the program SCRAP USA, SCRAP Humboldt opened their doors on April, 12, 2013 for the beginning of Humboldt County's first creative reuse center." ;
