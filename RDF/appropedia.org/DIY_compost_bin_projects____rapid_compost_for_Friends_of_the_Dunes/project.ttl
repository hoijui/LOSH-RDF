    okh:function "A rapid composting system was designed by Engr215 Introduction to Design Team 6 to find a better use for the green waste generated at the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center. Below is a detailed page on the process and cost of building the rapid compost system.   == Problem Statement == The Friends of the Dunes invites volunteers every week to remove invasive plants in the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center. Each week, a volume of approximately 6'x6'x6' of green waste is generated and shipped off the site to be disposed of miles away. In an effort to manage the waste on site, rather than shipping it, this rapid composting system was designed." ;
