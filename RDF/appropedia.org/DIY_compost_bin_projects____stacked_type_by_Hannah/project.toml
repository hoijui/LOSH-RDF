function = "I created a compost system for a 2 person household in Williams Bay, Wisconsin. I wanted the system to be simple easy to use and made from things around the home. The upkeep of this system is straightforward. There are links provided to help troubleshoot and learn more about making your own compost   == Background == In this household there are 2 people who cummulate a fair amount of green waste and yard trimmings along with food scraps from the kitchen. One major concern was deer being able to access the bin, and a want was for quick compost turnover with ease."
