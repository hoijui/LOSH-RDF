    okh:function "The project outlined in this page is a small and manageable worm bin designed so that kids ages eight to twelve can recreate it, without the help of their parents, following the instructions. Giving a child the opportunity to build a worm bin enables them to get hands-on experience with composting and sustainable living, and allows them to see waste transformed into something useful! After the projects have been finished and released, material regarding the details of the various projects will be compiled and published tentatively due out Fall 2011. The design outlined below is a product of Onycophora, a group of the Introduction to Design Engr215 students.   == Background == Locally Delicious is an organization based in Humboldt County with a commitment to raising awareness of the importance of community and sustainable living." ;
