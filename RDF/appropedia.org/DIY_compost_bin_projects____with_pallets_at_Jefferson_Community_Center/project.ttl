    okh:function "Our team worked with the Westside Community Improvement Association (WCIA) during the 2012 Spring semester at Humboldt State University for the Appropriate Technology course. Our project site is at the Jefferson School located on 1000 B St. in Eureka, CA. The people of WCIA would like a large composting system to handle all of their green yard waste. This waste will include all grass clippings, waste from the community gardens, and waste from pruning shrubs and trees. To become more sustainable, they would like to process their waste on site instead of their current plan to transport it over to Wes Green landscaping in Arcata, CA. We hope that this large scale composting system will be a viable option for their waste issues long into the future." ;
