function = "Food dehydration is both a desirable and appropriate technology for many reasons which include increasing the shelf-life of food without having to use refrigeration, and reducing product size which can maximize storage space.  Also, the process of dehydration is used to enhance foodstuffs directly (e.g. jerky, fruit leather) and indirectly (e.g. spices). The main principle behind food dehydration is simple:  to remove an ample quantity, or the majority (depending on the desired product), of water content from food products."
