    okh:function "Beginning in the Spring semester of 2011, Team SodHoppers joined together to work on a semester long project assigned to them by Lonny Grafman. Their client, Locally Delicious, gave them the opportunity to design and build a solar dehydrator that will be placed in a nearby elementary school. This design will ultimately reside in Locally Delicious's new book \"Lunchbox Envy,\" enabling schools across the country to implement the design also.   == Background == Locally Delicious is a group of women collaborating on a new book titled \"Lunch Box Envy.\" Several different Engineering 215 projects are to be included. The school solar dehydrator is one of them." ;
