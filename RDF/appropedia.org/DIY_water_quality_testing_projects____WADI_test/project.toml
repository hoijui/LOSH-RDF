function = "Over one billion people have little to no access to clean water. There is a need for disinfected water suitable for drinking, especially in developing areas of Africa, Asia, and South America where water is often contaminated with bacteria and other contaminants.   == Detailed description of the solution == WADI is a device that employs solar water disinfection, a simple, ecological, and cost-effective approach to treating water. A transparent PET-bottle is filled with contaminated water and exposed to the sun for some time. A progress bar indicates duration and displays a smiley face when the water has been successfully disinfected."
