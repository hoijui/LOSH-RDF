    okh:function "This project is a desktop menstrual cycle tracker, that one simply uses by moving the pointer as each day passes. In many countries and cultures, contraceptives are expensive and frowned upon, even with married couples. Couples in poverty struggle with having too many children, nevertheless. A method for preventing pregnancy without use of conventional contraceptives is by having sex at the correct time in a menstrual cycle to minimize the chance of a birth. This device cheaply allows women to track their cycle easily, and can also be used when a couple is having trouble having kids." ;
