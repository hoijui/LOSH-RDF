function = "== Problem being addressed == There is a need to develop CD4 counters that do not rely on laboratory workers and expensive/complicated equipment. A counter that can be used by rural clinicians in the field without extensive training would greatly assist in managing HIV in rural areas.   == Detailed description of the solution == Microfluidic cell chromatography isolates cells and other particles in a miniature sensing chamber, without the complex manual steps of blood tests.  The system takes advantage of electrochemical sensing, using lysate impedance spectroscopy. The system uses a simple sensor that counts the captured CD4 cells by measuring their internal contents electrically."
