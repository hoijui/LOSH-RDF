    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Diabetics need to measure their blood glucose levels on a daily basis to effectively monitor their disease, however test strips and glucometers are often too expensive for people in developing world settings.  There is a need for simple, cost-effective monitoring devices in these low-resource areas.   == Detailed description of the solution == The DeNovo Meter pairs an optical reader and disposable paper strips, which allows for safe, accurate, and inexpensive measuring of blood glucose levels. The locally manufactured colorimetric paper test-strips cost only 2 cents, which is 1/50 of the market price.    == Designed by == Designed by:  3 juniors at MIT; Paul Hlebowitsh, Allen Lin and Deepali Ravel 3 MIT alumni; Priyanka Jain, Shichao Liang and Yi Wang Location: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States   == When and where it was tested/implemented == Clinical trials were conducted in two rural areas of Nicaragua." ;
