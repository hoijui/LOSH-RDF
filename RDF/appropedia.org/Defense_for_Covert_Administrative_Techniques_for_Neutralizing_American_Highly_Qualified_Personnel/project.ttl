    okh:function "Ph.D. scientists and engineers are highly qualified personnel (HQP) that improve U.S. economic efficiency and generate new products including weapons of interest to the intelligence community. HQP represent a small fraction of the population, which make them favorable targets to compromise. This study analyzes how to defend against a novel approach of covert infiltration that uses administrative techniques to neutralize HQP without recruiting them directly. The approach follows five hierarchical strategies to replace the innovation cycle with administrative time expenditures. This approach is critically analyzed to further national security goals by providing intelligence service guidelines for defensive measures needed against this new weapon." ;
