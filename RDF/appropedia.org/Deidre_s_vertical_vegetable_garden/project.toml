function = "The Vertical Garden is a unique indoor/outdoor modular planter with multiple levels of vertically spaced pots/planters. Its superior vertical design saves space and water. With a flow through irrigation system, when you water the top plants it will water all the lower pots, with no waste of water. You can create different size racks to fit your garden needs. It can be tall with five levels of plants for a larger garden, or it can be built lower to the ground and longer if one so desires.\ngardening"
