    okh:function """The equations on this project need to be checked.. The original rope pump is a relatively inexpensive solution for pumping water out of relatively deep man-made wells. Using multiple pistons connected to a rope, the pipe system sits partially underwater, while the user turns a crank above the well. As the crank turns, the rope is moved down into the well, up the pipe system, and around the crank wheel, repeating itself over and over again. As the rope passes through the partially submerged pipe system, these pistons connected to the rope draw water up the pipe system, to a spout at the surface, where the water can be used.
