function = "== Abstract == This paper covers about detection of cancerous tumors in human breasts using a microstrip patch antenna which emits radiation in the microwave range. Fabrication of the patch antenna was done after analyzing simulation results of several patch antennas which were designed for different operating frequencies, using HFSS software. The cancer detection method mainly depends on the significant difference of electrical properties between a cancer tissue and a normal tissue. To validate the suitability of fabricated antenna to the purpose of detecting the breast cancers, two breast phantoms which have same electrical properties as an actual breast where only one phantom contains an artificial tumor, were prepared using different chemical recipes. Two patch antennas were used in the experimental set up for the purpose of transmitting and the receiving of the radiation."
