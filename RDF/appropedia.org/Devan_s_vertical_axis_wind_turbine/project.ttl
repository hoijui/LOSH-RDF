    okh:function "This is a project designed and built by a student in ENGR 305 at Humboldt State University. The student, Devan Hemmings, with the help of his father Rick, designed and built a Vertical Axis sing Turbine. The turbine uses principles of lift generated by three rotating airfoils and is similar to a design called the \"gyro mill,\" but is unique in some ways as well.   == Background == My experience and interest in alternative energy and appropriate technology have been growing steadily for the last few years, but I have just recently begun to really dive into it. I believe that taking ENGR 114 last semester and ENGR 305 this semester significantly supported that process." ;
