function = "This work offers a primer to the topic of AWVPs, and a description of how to build a dew collection rig. Unfortunately, dewfall is not currently recorded in most standard meteorological archives; so the next step for this project is to offer a reliable means of regional assessment that is accessible to a layman. The problem of obtaining clean drinking water is very widespread among developing nations. The atmosphere contains an abundant amount of water in the form of vapor; however it can be difficult and costly to harvest. Atmospheric water vapor processing (AWVP) is a new field of research that is developing ways to obtain that vapor."
