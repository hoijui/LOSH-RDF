function = "A dial indicator is a tool used to measure linear displacements. It accomplishes so via the use of a plunger that's constricted to a measured linear movement. Simply, when the plunger is pushed into the body of the tool, the distance it is pushed in is \"indicated\" on the \"dial\" face of the tool. This is useful for any kind of precise measurement of thickness, depth, width, and can even be used to ensure a machining device or tool is accurately trammed. https://www.youmagine.com/designs/dial-indicator OSAT: https://www.appropedia.org/Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology   == Bill of Materials ==   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Number 2 Phillip's Head Screw Driver 1/4 inch Open End Wrench TOOL REQUIREMENTS MAY VARY BASED ON NUT & BOLT SELECTION   == Skills and knowledge needed == 3D Printing Knowledge & Capabilities Understand the needs & application for a dial indicator Ability to assemble fasteners and critically aligned plastic components   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Download and print the plastic components listed in the bill of materials Recommended: Material: PLA Layer Height: 0.25 mm Shell Thickness: 0.8 mm Fill Density: 100% Print Speed: 50 mm/s Printing Temperature: 215 C Clean burrs and excess plastic from parts that may be remaining from print Align the corresponding components from the bill of materials to the pictures posted below while ensuring: All holes align All gears mesh together  \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t  Assemble Fasteners so that the head of the screws are on the face of the indicator Lightly tighten fasteners so that gears spin freely with minimal slop Assemble needle so that needle is spaced away from dial face Once completed, use a protractor to mark the face of the indicator in whichever scale is desired   == Common Problems and Solutions == If the gears don't align and interface properly, first ensure they are oriented with the proper gear in the proper location and proper orientation."
