    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == In remote locations, emergency situations and in the aftermath of disasters, medical facilities may be limited or virtually non-existent. Emergency surgical procedures requiring anaesthesia, such as caesarean section, may be necessary in these situations, where power supplies and medical gases are absent or unreliable.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Diamedica Portable Anaesthesia (DPA) Series provides a complete inhalation anaesthesia system in a case, suitable to carry as aircraft hand luggage and robust enough for any field, emergency or remote situation. Designed for field use the DPA series requires no electrical supply or compressed gases to function. It uses ambient air as a carrier gas, although supplementary oxygen can be used if available." ;
