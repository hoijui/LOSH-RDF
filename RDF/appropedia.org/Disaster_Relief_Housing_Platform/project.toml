function = "Simple and easy to produce, temporary housing platform to to aid in living conditions after a natural disaster   == What's Going On ==  Survivors of natural disasters, such as the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean and the 2009 earthquakes in Haiti, are left homeless. As a result victims will construct shanty camps, neighborhoods, and towns to fit the need of shelter. These camps are crowded and typically very unclean. Residents live at ground level with the camp's sewage, garbage and debris from the disaster. These living conditions cause the spread of disease and can contaminate living conditions for an entire family."
