function = "The Practical Action donkey plough was developed in Sudan in the Darfur region over a period of time where a number of trials and adaptations were made to make the design suitable for local conditions. The size and weight of the plough would be varied to suite different farming conditions In 1990 Practical Action's (then ITDG) work with an Oxfam animal traction project in Sudan was rekindled after suffering from logistical difficulties. The project was based in the Northern part of the country in Darfur province around Kabkabiya. This work led onto the Darfur Integrated Rural Livelihoods Programme that covers activities such as:  Training farmers in agricultural techniques - terracing and wadi (valley bottom) cultivation, which extend the range of crops that can be grown and make more efficient use of scarce water resources. Around 1000 farmers are trained each year, mainly by local extension workers Strengthening of the capacities of local village committees to manage and develop agricultural and water projects Construction of dams for rainwater harvesting, and training in dam construction, as well as improvement in the techniques of construction of tumad (shallow wells) in the wadis and the construction of haffirs (channels) for water supply Establishing several irrigated demonstration farms Introduction of donkey carts for transporting water - for household use, and other goods, reducing the time and drudgery of collecting water, especially for women.\nPreparation for the planting of seeds"
