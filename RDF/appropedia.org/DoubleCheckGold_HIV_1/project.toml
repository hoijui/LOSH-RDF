function = "== Problem being addressed == HIV/AIDS is an extreme health threat in much of the developing world. To diagnose HIV, blood samples are often required to be sent to a central laboratory to be processed, which is time-consuming and costly.   == Detailed description of the solution == This small and portable immunochromatography assay allows for rapid testing of HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. This assay can use whole blood, plasma, or human serum to test for HIV antibodies. The fluid is put in through the lateral flow assay and results can be achieved within 15 minutes with 99.9% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity."
