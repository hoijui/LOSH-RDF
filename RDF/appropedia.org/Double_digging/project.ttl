    okh:function """Bed preparation is the number one important thing you can do for you plants. Double-digging is a method of bed preparation that aerates soil to a depth of 24 in (2ft). This creates an environment in which plant roots thrive due to a more even distribution of nutrients, water, and air and loose soil so roots can spread out and reach a farther depth.   == When is it necessary? == Traditionally, double-digging was done when first starting a new bed and then repeated as necessary.
