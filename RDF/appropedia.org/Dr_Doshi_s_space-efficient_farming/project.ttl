    okh:function "Dr. Doshi, of the large densely packed city Mumbai, India, has developed food production techniques for his context. His city garden methods are appropriate to apply in reduced spaces as terraces and balconies, even on civil construction walls, and for not requiring big investments in capital or long hours of work. His farming practice is purely organic and is mainly directed to domestic consumption. His gardening tools are composed of materials available in the local environment: sugarcane waste, polyethylene bags, tires, containers and cylinders, and soil." ;
