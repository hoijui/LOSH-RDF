    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == In low resource settings, tuberculosis is typically diagnosed with sputum microscopy, which currently costs $30 for each test. While this method is low cost, the microscope method requires a culture of sputum, a mixture of saliva and phlegm, and can take up to 8 weeks to grow the culture. During that time, there is a possibility of the patient infecting others with tuberculosis.    == Detailed description of the solution == The Draper device is being designed to be a more cost and time efficient device to diagnose tuberculosis. The device is projected to cost around $1000-$2000 USD and each test is projected to cost $1 USD and it will give immediate feedback." ;
