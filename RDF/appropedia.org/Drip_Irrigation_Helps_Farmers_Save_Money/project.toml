function = "Krishnappa is a small farmer in a rural district of the south Indian state of Karnataka. In April 2006, he received assistance from a USAID-supported program and switched 3.25 acres of his 6.5 acre plot from flood irrigation to drip irrigation. This improvement reduced the use of his electric water pump from 84 hours to 25 hours a week. Thrilled with his savings on energy, water and labor costs, Krishnappa convinced other farmers to follow suit. Govindraj, another farmer, says: \"Time and money saved because of drip irrigation has helped me grow additional crops and increased my income.\" With this additional income, Govindraj's wife bought two cows and now manages a dairy micro-enterprise."
