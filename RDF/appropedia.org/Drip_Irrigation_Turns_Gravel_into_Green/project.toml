function = "What used to be a patch of gravel behind the Makombe homestead in Musipami village is now a thriving 100-squaremeter garden of green leafy vegetables — a small miracle in a remote and overpopulated village in a country (Zimbabwe) suffering from a complex economic, political and agricultural decline. USAID helped Mr. and Mrs. Makombe install a drip-irrigation kit for their garden — one of 24,000 plots established with the lowcost systems. Designed to save labor and water, enhance nutrition and improve food security, the average drip-irrigation kit is easy to install."
