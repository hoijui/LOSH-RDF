function = "The Drop Spindle is an ancient tool used for spinning fibers such as wool, cotton, flax, and hemp into yarn, without the need for a large, expensive, and complex spinning wheel. Traditionally Drop Spindles are made out of wood with with a notch, groove, or metal hook on the end for securing the yarn. The drop spindle provides the tension necessary to spin yarn and provides a convenient way to introduce twist into the yarn as well as a place to wind yarn as it is being spun. Spun yarn is used for a multitude of processes such as knitting, weaving, crocheting, thread-making and rope-making in order to produce final products. Aside from personal use, products such as clothing and rope are a necessary and marketable product in any society and can be sold or traded in exchange for other necessities."
