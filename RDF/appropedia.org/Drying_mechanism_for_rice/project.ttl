    okh:function "This article features instructions on how to build a fixed batch heated air drying bin from local materials. For further information on rice farming and appropriate practices, see Rice.   == Methods of Drying ==   === Field Drying === Rice is left to dry in fields Very low relative cost Advantages: Loosens panicles for ease in threshing Disadvantages: Very poor quality rice, cannot dry in rain (eg. wet season) or at night   === Sun Drying === Rice dries on pavement or drying mats by heat from the sun Very low relative cost Advantages: Better quality than field drying, relatively inexpensive Disadvantages: Poor milling quality, labor intensive, cannot dry in rain (eg. wet season) or at night   === Heated-Air Drying ===   ==== Fixed-Bed Dryer ==== Heated air flows through batch Low relative cost ($150 for circular batch – also can be considered in-store dryer due to long drying time, see below – and $1500 for flat bed) Advantages: Simple, inexpensive, fast drying Disadvantages: Reduction in milling yield (due to re-wetting of dry grains), risk killing seeds, labor intensive   === = Re-circulating Batch === =  Rice moves through sections that alternately dry and temper it Medium relative cost ($10,000) Advantages: Good quality yield, large capacity, low labor for mixing, lower moisture gradient Disadvantages: Requires servicing and skilled laborers, moving components   ==== Continuous Flow Dryer ==== Rice and air flow in two distinct directions High relative cost (large scale productions) Advantages: Large capacity Disadvantages: Complicated mechanisms   === In Store Drying === Low temperature deep bed drying High relative cost (large scale productions) Advantages: Energy efficient, large bins, excellent grain quality, dries in storage Disadvantages: Very long drying time, need bulk handling system, risk spoiling with faulty power supply   === Additional Notes === Research done into enhancing sun drying with solar collectors has shown that the sun cannot be intensified enough to increase drying time enough to justify the added cost." ;
