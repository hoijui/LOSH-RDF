    okh:function "This is a 3D printed Security Siren that could be used in low income areas where theft or other problems are an issue. The purpose of the siren is to get the attention of others nearby when a crime or other emergency is happening. Because crime rates are sometimes higher in lower income areas it would be beneficial to provide a low cost alternative to these areas. This siren has a 5:6 frequency ratio, also known as a untempered minor third. Having two clashing tone simultaneously makes the siren more noticeable." ;
