function = "Appropriate technology is designed to be \"appropriate\" to the context in which it is used. Most appropriate technologies are sustainable, small, and cost efficient. They help put power into the hands of the people at a more grassroots level. I designed a simple dust mask that can help protect people during construction and cleaning activities where they can inhale potentially harmful debris. This is appropriate because it allows people to create their own dust masks to fit the correct size (by scaling up or down), and it uses more readily available materials."
