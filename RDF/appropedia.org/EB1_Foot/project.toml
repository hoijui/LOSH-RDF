function = "== Problem being addressed == Prosthetic feet are usually the first part of the prosthetic leg to fail, particularly in developing country settings where people are often subject to poorly constructed roads and semi-wild trails.  At the same time, durable prosthetic feet need to be affordable for these patients.   == Detailed description of the solution == The EB1 is a single piece of vulcanized rubber shaped to resemble the human foot. Aluminum and wood are used to reinforce the foot.  The model is designed to last for three years, to be manufactured locally using local materials, and to cost less than $5.00 USD.   == Relevance to developing country settings == The EB1 is designed for use in Vietnam and is currently manufactured in that country."
