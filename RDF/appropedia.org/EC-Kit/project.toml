function = "== Problem being addressed == Microbiological water quality tests are expensive and often require electricity. Those areas most in need of water testing are often lacking electricity for incubators and other lab equipment.   == Detailed description of the solution == The EC-Kit has two tests for assessing water quality: the Colilert tubes and Petrifilms. The Colilert tubes have a reagent powder that indicates the presence or absence of total coliforms and fecal coliforms (e.g. E. coli) in 10 mL of water."
