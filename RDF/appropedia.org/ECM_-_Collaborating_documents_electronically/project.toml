function = "Couriers contribute greatly to global greenhouse gas emissions; in 2008 UPS emitted 13.2 million metric tons of CO2. Emissions are the result of shipping across great distances and consuming fossil fuels to power cars, locomotives and airplanes. When a company chooses to ship a document/package, a significant amount of carbon dioxide is emitted. This is a problem because carbon dioxide is classified as a major pollutant by the EPA and is believed to be the main contributing factor to global warming. In shipping documents in hard copy, businesses incur costs that may be avoidable."
