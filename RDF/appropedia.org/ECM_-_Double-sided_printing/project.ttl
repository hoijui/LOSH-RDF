    okh:function "Double-sided printing is one the easiest ways to save money, reduce waste, and improve your carbon footprint. If your printers already have the ability to print double-sided, then making a simple change on the default settings can substantially reduce the amount of paper used. This tool allows you to explore the potential savings accompanying this change. Below is an example of the potential environmental and cash savings that could be achieved by increasing your use of double-sided printing.   == Specific technology == Most printers found in a business settings are capable of printing double sided already, meaning no new hardware is required and the change can be completely implemented by changing the default settings to automatically print double-sided." ;
