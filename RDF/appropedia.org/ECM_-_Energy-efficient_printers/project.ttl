Please note that this analysis is not constructed for determine which device meets your organization's technical requirements (i.e. duplex-printing, integrated fax/scan capabilities, etc.). However, after narrowing down your selection to a list of devices that meet the technical requirements of your organization, the decision of purchasing one device over another should also be influenced by the energy usage of each device in its various states of operation. This type of analysis evaluates a portion of the operating expense of the device by allowing you to explore the savings from replacing your printer(s) at the end of their useful life with more energy-efficient printer(s).
