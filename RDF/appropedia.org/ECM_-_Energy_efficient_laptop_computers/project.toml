function = "Replacing your current desktop configuration with a laptop and docking station can save a great deal of money and electricity, as well as increasing productivity due to the inherent mobility in laptops. In general, desktop computers use much more energy than notebooks or netbooks. Even an EnergyStar certified desktop can use up to 160 kWh of power in one year, while the average EnergyStar certified notebook uses 37 kWh. May offices may be wary of switching to laptops simply because they are used to having a desktop with a large monitor and external hardware, such as keyboard and mouse. This obstacle is overcome by using a laptop with a docking station.\nsaving energy"
