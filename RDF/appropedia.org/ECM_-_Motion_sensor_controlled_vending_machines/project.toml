function = "Vending machines operate 24 hours per day, seven days a week and can use large amounts of energy throughout those hours of operation. In addition to consuming 2,500 to 4,400 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy per year at average electricity costs of about 8 cents / kWh, the annual operating costs can range from $200 to $350. New, efficient vending machines are available that can greatly reduce operating costs through the use of infrared motion sensors. These sensors allow some of the machines functions to only work when a person is present in front of the sensor. The compressors run only enough to maintain a suitable temperature throughout the workday while the lights and other components remain off in order to minimize overall energy consumption."
