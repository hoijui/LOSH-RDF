    okh:function "A server is a computer dedicated to running sophisticated programs which require a substantial amount of memory and computing power. Servers are connected to a network, and other computers linked to the network can access the server to run those programs. In addition, they are also used to store information which can be accessed by other computers linked to the network. It is common practice for individual server machines to be dedicated to running a single program or task, ensuring sufficient resource availability while eliminating competition for resources between programs or tasks running on a single physical server, and simplifying troubleshooting processes. Servers often possess more power than necessary for running one specific program or task and it is not uncommon for their computing potential to be underused." ;
