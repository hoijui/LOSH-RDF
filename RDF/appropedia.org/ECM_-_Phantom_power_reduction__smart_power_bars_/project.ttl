    okh:function """Standby power or "phantom power" is defined as the power consumed by electric and electronic devices, such as computers and television sets, when they are plugged in but not performing their desired task, even if they are not turned on. This power consumption has been quantified as representing more than $3 billion in annual energy costs in the continental United States. Much of this cost is avoidable in both residential and commercial applications through the use of "smart strip" power bars.   == Smart strips == Smart strip power bars replace traditional power bars and have one control device that will switch power on/off to the other devices on the strip. For example, at a typical workstation you may have a computer (monitor and CPU), a phone charger, a desk lamp, a printer/scanner/copier, and perhaps some speakers.
