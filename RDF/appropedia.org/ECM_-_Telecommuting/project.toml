function = "Telecommuting is a work arrangement for which an employee is allowed flexibility in their working location and hours. Its main purpose and advantage is that it reduces the need to commute to a central place of work. Instead, the employee works at a remote location (such as their home) while in contact with the workplace through telecommunication links, such as video conferencing.   == Technology == By definition \"telecommuting\" means replacing an employee's regular daily commute to work, in a personal car or public transit, with virtual communication. This communication could take the form of e-mails or phone messages, although most businesses will generally link employees through a remote network access."
