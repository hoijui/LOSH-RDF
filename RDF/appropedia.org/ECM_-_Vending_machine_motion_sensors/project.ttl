    okh:function """Vending machines are an everpresent novelty in many establishments and a simple example of how energy saving techniques can be applied with significant impact to energy costs and annual CO2 output. Here we explore the economic and environmental viability of using a motion sensor unit to control the operation of a vending machine such that it remains on stand-by mode while not in use. When motion is sensed (that is, a potential customer approaches the vending machine), the controller turns on the machine's light and compressor to be ready for a sale. The lights and compressor (optional) are then then turned off after a predefined period of inactivity, typically 15 minutes. Quality of vendable goods it maintained by a microcontroller in the system that powers up the machine every 2 hours to to maintain standard operating temperatures.
