    okh:function "As a part of the Engineering 210 course at Humboldt State University, students were tasked to work in groups of 3 or 4 to build a truss bridge out of balsa wood and super glue. Our group included David Topete, Kong Vang, and Andrew Kizer (listed left to right in Figure 1) and we are the KAD Group. This page is designed to showcase the bridge we built including the design, how it was made, and how it performed.   == Project goals == The class project had specific requirements and parameters that each bridge must follow for both design and building:  The bridge must span 36 in and rest between 2 surfaces with a 1/2 overlay on either side. The bridge must have a minimum height of 4 in The bridge must have a minimum width of 4 in The bridge must support a minimum weight of 24 lbs The bridge must be made of balsa wood and super glue only." ;
