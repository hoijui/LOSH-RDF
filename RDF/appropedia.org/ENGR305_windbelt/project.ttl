This page covers a brief overview of windbelt technology, design objectives and criteria, cost, a DIY guide, further steps to be taken on the project, and conclusion on the results of the semester's work.      === Background === The windbelt, first designed by Shawn Frayne , is a device that converts wind into usable electricity by the principle of aeroelastic flutter. Unlike conventional wind turbines, windbelts are effective at producing electricity at low wind speeds. Regions that typically have lower average wind speeds are perfect for windbelt installations." ;
