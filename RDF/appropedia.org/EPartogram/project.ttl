    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Maternal death rates are often high in resource-poor settings because of inefficient and inaccurate labor assessment and delayed complication management.  The paper partogram, although a useful tool for monitoring and assessing the progress of labor, remains cumbersome and time-consuming.    == Detailed description of the solution == The ePartogram is an affordable, easy-to-operate, efficient and comprehensive electronic alternative to the paper partogram. It is a hand-held device that allows for more efficient recording of clinical observations, more accurate predictions of complications, and more rapid decision-making. It includes a sensor module for partial automation of data collection and a telemedicine module that allows midwives to obtain support and guidance from distant senior-level clinicians." ;
