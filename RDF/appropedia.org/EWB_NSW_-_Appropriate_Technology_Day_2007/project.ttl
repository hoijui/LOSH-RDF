    okh:function "APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY DAY CENTENNIAL PARK, SYDNEY SUNDAY 4TH MARCH 2007 11AM TO 1AM Appropriate technology is technology that can be made at an affordable price by ordinary people, using local materials to do useful work, in ways that do the least possible harm to both human society and the environment. The technology appropriate to a certain requirement depends on the location and background of the people it serves. For example, open combustion may be the most appropriate source of energy in sparse, developing communities, whereas it might be grid-based electricity in large cities. People without access to the technologies of the west can benefit from improved stove designs, improved housing design, alternatives to wood for burning, cooking with the sun, sanitising water with simple filters or even UV rays. Last year, the open day organised by EWB was a great way to showcase some of these technologies and, given the relaxed informal setting, it was even possible to explore potential improvements together!" ;
