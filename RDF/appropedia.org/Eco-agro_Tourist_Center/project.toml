function = "This project aims to use plastic bottles, glass bottles, aluminum cans and other recycled materials for construction of buildings. It is a project which is meant for about 100 houses, women with children living in extreme poverty. This way will not only help with recycling, but also save the ecosystem and at the same time solve a housing problem. The first house made of bottles was \"Warnes\" which was built in the village of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. This new center gives adequate housing to each of the people in need, sustains a legacy about the construction using any object with the same material, and may in one way or another create new things with the used bottles."
