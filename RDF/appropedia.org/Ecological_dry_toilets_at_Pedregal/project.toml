function = ".5 billion people world wide lack access to basic sanitation. This results in illnesses and deaths including 2 million deaths a year due to diarrhea. Composting toilets are a cheap and efficient option for sanitation. They save water, produce good quality compost and reduce the incidence of intestinal infections and other diseases.This is one project in a series of soil conservation, groundwater recharge, and farming demonstration projects at Pedregal a Permaculture Demonstration Center in San Andres Huayapam, Mexico.   == Benefits ==  Effective at eliminating odor from addition of lime or ash Doesn't attract flies Reduces human contact with contagious illnesses Produces composted fertilizer that is rendered safer for human use as parasites are killed and the bacteria count is reduced Prevents contamination of groundwater, since it is closed during composting Is great for off grid systems that do not have access to a municipal sewer system It is cheaper then installing a municipal waste treatment system In order to work it does not require the addition of more water, a precious resource better drank then flushed down the toilet in most communities."
