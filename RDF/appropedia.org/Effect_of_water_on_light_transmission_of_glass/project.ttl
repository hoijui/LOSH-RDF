    okh:function "One way to improve the productivity of a solar still is to pour cooling water over the glass cover. My hypothesis was that pouring water over the glass would block some of the sunlight, possibly cancelling out the increase in productivity obtained by a cooler glass surface. The literature says the water actually lets more light in because it cuts down on the losses due to absorption. I had to see it with my own eyes, so I performed a simple experiment that showed the effect of water flow on the amount of irradiance coming through the glass.   == Setup #1 == The first experimental setup, shown in Figure 1, consisted of a small piece of glass held in place with a tupperware container." ;
