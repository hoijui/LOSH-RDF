    okh:function "We, Juliana Goldstein and Irene McNaughton spent the summer in the small town of Parras, a beautiful desert oasis located in Northern Mexico in the state of Coahuila. We went there as a group of fourteen students from Humboldt State University, a small college in Northern California, to study Appropriate Technology (AT) and the Spanish language. We both study Liberal Studies Elementary Education at Humboldt State University and have desires to educate the youth about the environment and the importance of taking care of the world we live in. Last year two students from the 2005 Parras group started an organic garden at an asilo, located at a nunnery, that acts as a foster home. The mission of the asilo is to take in young girls and provide them with a positive and healthy environment to learn and grow." ;
