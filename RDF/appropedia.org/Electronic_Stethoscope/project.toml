function = "Stethoscopes are a critical tool used by doctors on a daily basis for amplifying the body's functions. Primarily, heartbeats and breaths are the primary target of listening. Usually, stethoscopes work by using a large diaphragm and a tiny pipe to transmit the audio to the ears. In the past, 3D printed stethoscopes have been attempted, and failed to work well. This is due to the large reduction in area from the diaphragm to tubing that is required to get a large amplification."
