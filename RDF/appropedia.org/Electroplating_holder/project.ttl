    okh:function "Electroplating holder that allows deposition on fixed area on sample and has contacts that are isolated from electrolyte.   == Introduction == Electroplating on limited area on a sample requires means to prevent electrolyte contact or insulating material in the areas that are not be coated. This is usually achieved by either patterning the conductive layer on the sample or by masking parts of the sample with insulating material. Here the aim is to define center area of the sample to be plated by isolating the rest of the sample and contacts with O-rings. This way it is possible to have continuous seed-layer on the sample while plating only in the center of the sample." ;
