function = "== Problem being addressed == Twenty million babies are born prematurely every year; the majority in resource-limited settings where access to advanced medicine is difficult. Many premature babies have difficulty regulating their own body temperature so hypothermia a serious problem. Incubators used in advanced healthcare nations, however, are too expensive to be applicable to resource-limited settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Embrace Infant Warmer works by combining a hypoallergenic sleeping bag with a compartment that holds a pouch of wax. The pouch of wax is first heated to 37 degrees Celsius and then inserted into the sleeping bag with the baby."
