    okh:function "This project was buidt as part of the engr 305 class in the Spring 2015 semester. In order to reduce my impact on the environment and grow some of my own food, I built my own small scale personal use aquaponics system. In order to reduce the cost of construction, I utilized everyday objects, most of which I already owned. The system only uses 12.045 kWh/year and generates enough food to supplement my need to go to the grocery store and buy salad greens. It requires very little maintenance." ;
