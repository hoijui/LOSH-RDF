function = "In 2004, HSU Whole Earth Engineering-114 students assisted Bart Orlando in a project to fabricate a bike trailer for the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT). The trailer consisted of a welded frame of 1 inch steel box tubing. It was strong enough to carry an ~135lb woman and able to turn on a dime. Students learned how to design a simple trailer frame and hitch, cut box tubing with a Saws-all, remove burs with a file and pedal powered grinder, weld steel, paint steel and safely tow a bike trailer for the first time. Both men and women took turns learning to use a wire feed arc welder to join the steel struts of 1\" box tubing."
