    okh:function "UTC in Mexico built a Solar Learning Station with help and instruction from Lonny. We have constructed a local version of the learning station to be used to instruct students, faculty, and visitors. By building a station here, we achieved the dual purpose of helping people learn about PV and we learn some hands-on, in-depth knowledge of PV systems.   == Description of Goals and Purpose == The goal of the project was to improve upon UTC's system and produce a functional, convenient, portable, and instructional learning station. By meeting the criterion mentioned below, we hope to stimulate and foster interest in PV systems with students, faculty, and visitors." ;
