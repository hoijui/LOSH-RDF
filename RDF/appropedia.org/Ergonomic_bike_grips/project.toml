function = "Bicycles are a mode of transportation used throughout the world. There are 3 pieces of a bicycle that interact with the users. They are the seat, handlebar grips, and pedals. I set out to design and improve the bike grips that attach to the handlebars. I based my design off of Ergon GP1 Grips to be easily printed out of TPU or any other flexible filament."
