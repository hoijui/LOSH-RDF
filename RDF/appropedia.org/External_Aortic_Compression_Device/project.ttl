In trauma patients, hemorrhagic shock is the second most frequent cause of death.   == Detailed description of the solution == The external aortic compression device, also known as the EACD, consists of a strong metal spring, cylindrical in shape, covered with leather. It has a height of 12 cm (5 cm when compressed), diameter of 8 cm, and a net surface area of 22.3 cm2. It is fixed in place by a leather belt wrapped around the waist." ;
