    okh:function "This article assumes that the input for the desired low voltage power supply is alternating current (AC) and that the power supply will be outputting low voltage direct current (DC). If you have a higher voltage direct current source and require a lower voltage, you will want to use a DC to DC converterW. If you have a main voltage alternating current source that you would like to use at a lower voltage, you will want to use a transformerW. You can connect the Low voltage power supply with:  Car socket 12 volt 3rd world CCFL lamp (2007 model) Links Low voltage connection basics   == Using a PC power supply ==     Typical PC power supplies have maximum output power ratings ranging from 300 watts to 500 watts and contain the needed circuitry to convert alternating current (at 110V or 220V) into direct current at a lower potential (5V and 12V) for your low voltage needs. Computer components require a clean (ripple free) power supply, when the voltage of either the 12V or 5V (in some cases 3.3 is also provided) begins to drop below or above this point, computer crashes can become more frequent. Your local computer repair shop may have several \"bad\" power supplies on hand that you could acquire for a very low price. Tools:  screwdriver cable cutter (optional) Materials:  Old computer power supply Electric connection block (optional) One benefit of using an old computer power supply as your power supply is that the enclosure will already be grounded (as long as you use a three prong grounded outlet) and there will be minimal risk of shock to the user." ;
