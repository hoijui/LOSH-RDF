function = "This simple device not only saves hours of painstaking labor, but also increases the viability of the nut as a cash crop. To achieve the goal of producing a mold for the UNS from materials and resources found in Haiti, Team JAKS devised solution called Hot Dang Plastic Encasement (HDPE). The solution is a method of recycling discarded HDPE bags into a strong plastic material. The solution employs crocheting yarn made from the plastic bags into a loose form of the shape desired and then using heat to fuse the crocheted plastic into a hard plastic mold. To use this method to create the UNS mold, ceramic pieces made by pouring the clay into the current molds must be produced."
