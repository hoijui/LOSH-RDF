function = "The Full Belly Project (FBP), has designed a Universal Nut Sheller (UNS) for distribution throughout West Africa and Haiti. The UNS shells large amounts of nuts in a fraction of the time that it would take a single person. Our Engr215 Introduction to Design class from Humboldt State University was divided into seven teams, each consisting of four members. Each team was given one of three assignments:  Create a smaller version of the UNS to be marketed in the US in order to fund FBP's efforts abroad. Find a way to make a UNS out of cheaper, lighter and more sustainable materials for the countries of West Africa."
