function = "The Full Belly Project is a non profit organization working to provide simple technologies to improve life in impoverished areas in West Africa and Haiti. Creative Innovations formed as part of Humboldt State University's Engineering 215 class, Introduction to Design. The group's assignment was to improve the Full Belly Project's Universal Nut Sheller (UNS) with the improvements geared toward rural farmers in West Africa. The Full Bell is the result of this assignment. It improves the original UNS by reducing the cost and increasing durability of the sheller."
