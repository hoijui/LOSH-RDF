function = "This is an interactive exhibit that demonstrates how the forces of nature contribute to the formation of sand dunes. This page is focused on the Pump Powered Dune Movement Simulator that was created by the Humboldt State University Engr215 Introduction to Design team, Four Dudes, and the process that went into designing and building it. Our project was to create an exhibit for our client, the Friends of the Dunes, that will provided an interactive experience educating visitors about sand dunes and the processes that facilitate their movement and formation. The Friends of the Dunes is a non-profit organization in Humboldt County, California focused on conservation of sand dunes coastal environments. One of the properties this organization owns is the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center."
