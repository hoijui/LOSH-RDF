Their Coastal Nature Center is a place where they promote green solutions by educating visitors. Construction started on the nature center in 2007, and there are still a few outstanding projects that need to be completed. One of the projects is a green roof on the west awning. As part of the Engr215 Introduction to Design course, we were given the opportunity to design the green roof, and build an educational model of it."
