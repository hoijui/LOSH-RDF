    okh:function "The goal of this project was to build a low-embedded energy amphitheater for Friends of the Dunes at the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center. The Sandy Cove Amphitheater consists of three arced retaining walls made from urbanite, or reused concrete, to form its structure. It will mainly be used as an environment to instruct and lecture young students about the dunes between Arcata Bay and the Pacific Ocean. It may also be utilized as a seating area for the general public.   == Introduction == The Builders of the Bay are a part of Humboldt State University's spring 2012 Engineering 215 course." ;
