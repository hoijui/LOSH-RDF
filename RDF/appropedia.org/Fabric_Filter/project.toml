function = "Where cloth material is readily available, fabric filtration is a simple method of improving water quality for developing nations. In countries such as Kenya, where cloth material is a cheap and abundant resource, fabric filters provide a viable water sanitation solution. However, because the quality of the filter varies from fabric to fabric, this method of filtration is designed to be used alongside a water treatment agent which eradicates any harmful chemicals or microorganisms. This type of filter is primarily used to lower the turbidity (or \"cloudiness\") of the water to enhance the overall quality of the water. Most water treatments only eliminate the risk associated with the water contaminants â€“ they do not rid the water of other unwanted particles in the water (such as clay, sand, leaves, dead bugs, etc.)."
