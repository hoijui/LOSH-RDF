    okh:function "This wire band is a first prototype of a low-cost face mask band to address the lack of 3D printers and the overall cost of printing bands in El Salvador. This design takes only two minutes to make and can be made anywhere to ensure a better fit and a safe use of protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. This design is intended to substitute 3D printed designs such as the one currently recommended by the NIH in order to ensure access to people in settings where 3D printers are not available, and to reduce dependency of providers for plastic bands.   == Assembly == The wire is simply bent in the shape shown in the photo. I experimented with other shapes such as a ring." ;
