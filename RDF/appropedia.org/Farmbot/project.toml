The tool head is designed to enable automatic mounting of tools including a seeder, soil sensor, and weeder. Farmbot is controlled by a Raspberry Pi microcomputer running the Farmbot operating system and a Farmduino microcontroller. Farmbot is programmable through a web interface that enables remote access."
