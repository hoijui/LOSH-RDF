function = "== Problem being addressed == Higher birth rates often characterize developing nations, and one important reason is the large number of unplanned pregnancies.  Women in resource-poor settings often do not have the means or the knowledge to track their menstrual cycle to plan their pregnancies.   == Detailed description of the solution == Paul Blumenthal of Stanford University is developing a fertility awareness mobile application that collects and processes information regarding womenâ€™s menstrual cycles and sends free text messages to women regarding their menstrual status.  It provides individuals with an easy way to track their own cycles and enables them to make informed decisions regarding their pregnancies. This can be especially useful in developing settings where cell phones are becoming widely available even for the poorest sectors of society."
