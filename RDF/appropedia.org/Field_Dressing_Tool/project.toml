function = "Animals raised on a farm or harvested from the field need to be field dressed and skinned in order to obtain quality, unspoiled meat. This process is often interrupted due to dull cutting blades that are not sized properly for the task. The OSAT field dressing tool allows the user to cut only what is needed in a safe manner. This is accomplished by mounting a replaceable utility blade on a 3D printed handle with a guard. This design allows the user to cut just underneath the skin without puncturing organs."
