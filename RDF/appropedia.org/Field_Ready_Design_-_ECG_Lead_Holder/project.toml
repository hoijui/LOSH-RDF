function = "This design was created in response to a design request submitted by Field Ready, a non-profit 501c3, that seeks to make field ready humanitarian solutions to problems across the world. The design fulfills the need for a cheap single 3D print that will function as a ECG limb lead holder. The device was designed using dimensions similar to the previous device used as requested. Requested parameters for the printed part are as follows: 3D printable as a single item (not made up of multiple parts) Similar Dimensions to original part Quick, easy, and intuitive to use Contain an appropriate placed hole such that existing sensors can be attached   == Bill of Materials == Single Part file designed using FreeCad. The device was printed using Hatchbox translucent orange PLA with a 10% infill originally."
