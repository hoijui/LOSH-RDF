    okh:function "Sunil works as a Biomedical Engineer at Grande International Hospital, Kathmandu. A piece of equipment that he repeatedly sees in the engineering department is the nebuliser compressor. A nebuliser works by using compressed air to convert liquid medicine to an aerosol that can be inhaled by the patient. However, the plastic connector which attaches the medication tube to the compressor keeps breaking [1] Once a new hole is drilled through the nebuliser's exterior using a 12 mm drill bit, my connector will slide into the hole and be fastened with a 3d-printed nut. My connector was designed using FreeCAD from the dimensions provided by the site." ;
