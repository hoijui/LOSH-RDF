    okh:function "For this OSAT Project a design challenge was done for Field Ready, which makes humanitarian supplies in the field. The reason this design challenge was created was to replace a poorly designed connector for an air hose on a nebuliser. The current fitting often snaps off under normal use and requires a significant amount of effort every several days to re-glue the undersized fitting back on. The main two improvements to this product as made by this project are that it has a larger diameter going through the plastic casing of the nebuliser, which was desired, and that it has clamping force on the casing to hold the fitting more steady. One of the design requests was to create threads on the fitting that could be used with a nut to clamp down on the plastic casing, but from experience, 3D printed threads do not offer significant clamping force." ;
