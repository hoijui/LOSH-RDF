function = "Filament is expensive. Recycled plastic is cheap. This extruder allows you to create cheap filament from ground/pelletized plastic. Important!!!! You will need metal working tools to make this properly, a lathe and mill are highly recommended but it is possible to get a way with an angle grinder and drill press."
