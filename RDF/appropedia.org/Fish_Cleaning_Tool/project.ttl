    okh:function "Tool Background: When considering something useful for the developing world, an easy to use, cost effective, and helpful tool. Anyone with access to a 3D printer can create (and customize) this tool to help with cleaning fish. It is a handle that serves three functions: a razor blade to cut open the belly, a scoop to clean out the guts, and a scaler to scrape off the scales. This multi-functional tool is all that would be needed to quickly and effectively clean fish in order to increase the storage life.. Fishing Background: \"Fish and seafood are amongst the most traded food products in the world." ;
