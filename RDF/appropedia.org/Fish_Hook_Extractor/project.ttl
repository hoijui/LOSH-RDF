    okh:function "In many parts of the world, fishing is a very large part of life, as a plentiful source of both food and income to many people. A fish hook extractor tool aids a fisherman in removing hooks from a fish's mouth with ease and speed, especially when a hook has been lodged deep within the fish or in a difficult spot to reach with one's hand. It also helps a fisherman by retrieving hooks that would have otherwise been lost to the fish. Additionally, it is an incredibly helpful tool in cold temperatures, where the fisherman will not have to remove a glove in order to remove the hook from a fish's mouth. This tool is an OSAT, as it contributes to various sustainable development goals such as 2) Zero Hunger and 8) Decent Work & Economic Growth." ;
