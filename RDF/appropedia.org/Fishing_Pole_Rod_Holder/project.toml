function = "incorrectly designed so that primitive components are not held together correctly mechanical stability questionable design to be 3d printable lacking The fishing pole rod holder is OSAT as it allows a person that is fishing to set their fishing pole in the holder that sticks into the ground and can be left unattended to catch fish. This can be used all over the world to let a fishing pole catch a fish while the fisherman can go perform other duties and then come back to tend to their fish that will hopefully be caught on the fishing pole. The rod holder can accommodate a variety of fishing poles. The fishing pole rod holder gives the fisherman confidence that their pole will not be gone when they return to check on the fishing pole. The rod holder can be placed in the zero hunger category for OSAT as it helps fishermen put more rods out in the water while fishing depending on the fishing regulations to have a better chance to catch more fish for food."
