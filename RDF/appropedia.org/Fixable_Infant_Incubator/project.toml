function = "In designing this device, our goal has been to engineer a simple solution to a complex problem in the developing world. Our proposal is to design a safe incubator that will be used in local health centers, be easily assembled, be portable, need minimal operating capabilities and will keep the infant warm and hydrated. 1 out of every 22 babies born in the world dies before reaching 28 days of age. In developed countries, such as the United States, these babies are cared for via infant incubators, life support machines that provide adequate thermal regulation and environmental control for the baby while it uses all of its resources to complete development and attain normal size. However, in developing countries, infant incubators are not adequately utilized."
