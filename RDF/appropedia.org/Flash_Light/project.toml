function = "Project goal: Create a cheap and customizable light for anyone to make and use. This is a much safer way to light dark areas then a gas lamp, which can start fires and releases harmful gasses. By making a small and easily portable light it can be used in developing countries as wells as developed countries. If a natural disaster causes the grid to go black or in an area where power is not consistent, a flash light helps light up a person's world.   == Background Information, what you need to know == LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)- Depending on the specs for the LEDs that are being used."
