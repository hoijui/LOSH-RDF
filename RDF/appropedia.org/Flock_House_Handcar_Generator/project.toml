function = "This page focuses on the Pump'n Power, which is an alternative power generation device designed and created for the Flock House for their 2012 migratory housing habitat project in New York. The needs of the Flock House were identified and criteria were developed to ensure a design that met certain needs and specifications. After multiple alternative solutions were formulated, one solution was chosen which best met the given criteria. A list of costs were cataloged for hours spent and materials used for the project. The final project results are pending the testing results of the new generator."
