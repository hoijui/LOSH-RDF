It was constructed for the Flock House Project in New York City by Team Stark Industries during the Fall 2011 Engineering 215 - Introduction to Design class at Humboldt State University. We were tasked with the creation of a meter to provide information about the energy storage system of the Flock House. This meter will be utilized daily by the Flock House for the duration of its travels around New York City. The meter serves as both an educational tool for the public as well as a tool for the artists living aboard by presenting an alert when power levels are too low." ;
