    okh:function "Due to a continual rise in human population and an uncertain environmental future, the concept of housing and available resources must be rethought. The Flock House, founded by Mary Mattingly, addresses this in a sustainable and artistic manner. As a part of Engineering 215 - Introduction to Design at Humboldt State University, Team Apple Skins is working with the Flock House to design a comprehensive skin which will complement the structure of the Flock House in a functional and meaningful way.   == Background ==  The Flock House is a group of sustainable, mobile, living systems that each house two resident artists. These living systems are designed to educate and inspire people with the dynamic ecological relationships between the Flock House system and New York City." ;
