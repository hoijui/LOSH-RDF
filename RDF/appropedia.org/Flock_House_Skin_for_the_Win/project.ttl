She is a well known and respected artist in New York City and founder of many projects other than the Flock House Project including the Waterpod Project for which a previous Engineering 215 Intro to Design class were also participants. The objective of team Skin for the Win is to design a shell to supplement the already existing fiberglass frame of the Flock House to make it resistant to the common weather conditions of New York City. Our client wishes this shell to be composed of mainly repurposed materials, and it must be durable enough to last throughout the spring and summer months. To complete this objective, team Skin for the Win will use a design process involving the following steps:  Project Formulation Problem Analysis and Literature Review Alternative Solutions Design Process Specification of Final Solution   == Background ==  Mary Mattingly is the visionary artist in charge of the Flock House project." ;
