function = "Flowmeters are the devices that are used to measure the flow of liquid & gases that pass through them. Flowmeter that measure the flow by calculating the amount of liquid flown in unit time are called velocity flowmeter. This type of flowmeter typically provides with velocity of flow (ex: 10 litres per minute). Volumetric flowmeter on the other hand measure the total amount that has been discharged. For example this flowmeters may be utilized to know the amount used in house over a month(100 l)."
