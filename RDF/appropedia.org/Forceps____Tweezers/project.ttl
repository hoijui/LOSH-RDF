    okh:function "Field Ready is working with World Vision to provide medical supplies to a number of Heath Posts in the Dolakha district in Nepal. Health posts provide a local first point of contact for those in rural areas who may need medical assistance, and provide basic medical care. A simple item often needed is a pair of tweezers â€“ used for a range of purposes, from removing foreign bodies to handling sterile bandages. However, if dropped, they must be re-sterilized, which can make routine tasks frustrating and slow for health workers who often only have a couple of pairs." ;
