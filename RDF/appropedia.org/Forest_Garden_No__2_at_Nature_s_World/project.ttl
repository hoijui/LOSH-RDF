    okh:function "Nature's world was an eco visitor attraction in Middlesbrough, UK. It had various themed gardens and educational features, and closed to the public in 2013. Parts of the site are now managed by a volunteer group (see: http://www.friendsofnaturesworld.co.uk/ ). The site also hosts the offices of Middlesbrough Environment City (see: https://menvcity.org.uk/ ). General aims of the volunteer group are a balance between stewardship of habitat to promote wildlife diversity, and restoration of original form of the gardens. The gardens are open to the public on specific days for education and leisure events." ;
