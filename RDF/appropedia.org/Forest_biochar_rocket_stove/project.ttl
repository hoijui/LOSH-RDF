    okh:function "This stove was designed to provide a source of biochar for small scale growers while burning the gases given off form the char production to provide energy for space heating and cooking. This is a rocket stove type design that uses small pieces of wood or other biomass as the insulation. The heat produced by burning wood in the rocket stove causes the wood/biomass insulation in the surrounding chamber (retort) to undergo pyrolysis. The gases produced by the pyrolysis are fed into the stove and burnt, As air does not flow through the retort the wood held within turns into biochar/charcoal rather than burning to an ash. Unlike much other biochar or charcoal production the burning of the emitted gasses yields about 70% of the energy available from the wood for cooking and heating and also greatly improves the emissions profile of the gasses that are emitted." ;
