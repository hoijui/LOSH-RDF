function = "A fork support is inserted in between the fork of a bike to help hold the suspension rigid during transportation the bike. If the suspension is not held rigid during transportation, it will be constantly activated due to the vibrations from the vehicle. This leads to early failure of the suspension. To prevent any damage and provide a longer life of the suspension, a support is inserted so that the suspension can no longer be active during transportation. https://www.youmagine.com/designs/fork-support-for-bike   == Bill of Materials == - PLA Filament, 1.75 mm Diameter   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Utility Knife (Help to clean up edges and fit parts together)   == Skills and knowledge needed == A basic understanding of basic CAD software & 3D-printing   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Printer settings: Layer Height - 0.3 mm, Fill Density - 20%, Print Speed - 80 mm/s, Extruder Temp."
