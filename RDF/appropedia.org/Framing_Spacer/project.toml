function = "This segmented design is able to account for the variations in stud width (Metal Stud = 1.375 in., Wood 2x4 = 1.5 in.) and stud-center to stud-center distances (12 in., 16 in., 19.2 in., 24 in.) that are commonly used while framing. This tool is intended to make the process of wall framing easier and more time efficient. Framing the walls of a building can be very time consuming as it requires the worker to be very meticulous in their measurements in order to insure that the plywood that makes up the wall fits properly against the wall frame. To make this process easier, I have come up with a spacer that a user would place in between a fastened stud and an unfastened stud in order to properly position the unfastened stud before it is attached to the frame. This segmented design is able to account for the variations in stud width (Metal Stud = 1.375 in., Wood 2x4 = 1.5 in.) and stud-center to stud-center distances (12 in., 16 in., 19.2 in., 24 in.) that are commonly used while framing."
