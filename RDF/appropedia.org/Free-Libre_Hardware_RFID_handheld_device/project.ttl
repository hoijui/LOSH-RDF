The ever-increasing amount of guests arriving each year made the old way of operating unreliable. The system was based on trust whereby guests would create an account and deposit money on it, which could then be used anywhere within the city by writing the account number, amount and signing. Many guests would leave before the money could be processed and various services suffered losses due to this." ;
