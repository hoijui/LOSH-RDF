    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Newborn mortality accounts for over half of all infant deaths. In developing countries, where giving birth at home is common, there may be a lack of electricity to support delivery. Hand cranked heart rate monitors are more suitable for rural settings than expensive Western-derived equipment which can be difficult to repair and often rely on replaceable batteries. Discovering lowered heart rate during contractions gives medical workers a chance to suspend delivery, try to get more sophisticated medical assistance, and protect the well being of the mother and infant.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device measures the infantâ€™s heart rate during birth." ;
