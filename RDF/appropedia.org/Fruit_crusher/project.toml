function = "This fruit crusher project is designed for less developed countries that do not have access to the technology that other countries have. It was designed with the use of local simple tools and scraps that would already have been acquired. It fulfills the need to crush fruit down for cooking and baking that would otherwise be a laborious task as well as a time consuming one. No previous designs have been found and commercial designs are found to be around $100.   === Image of completed print === Below is an image of the completed assembly."
