function = "A wild berry picker is appropriate because it contributes to the zero hunger goal of appropriate technology in the way that it allows collecting food to be much more efficient. Picking wild berries from the bush can be very time consuming. A berry scoop picker can allow berry picking to become exponentially faster and much more efficient as compared to picking berries individually. In many locations it is also dangerous to pick berries where venomous snakes and poisonous spiders live in the bushes. The scoop allows the picker to keep a further distance from the bush, putting a barrier between them and any creatures living in the plants."
