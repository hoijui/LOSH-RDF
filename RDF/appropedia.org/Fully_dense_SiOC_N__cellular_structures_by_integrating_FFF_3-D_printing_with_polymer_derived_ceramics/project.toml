function = "Great advances have been made in various 3D printing methods for ceramics. Fabrication of Si-based ceramics using polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) is gaining popularity. Using this route, preceramic polymers can be shaped in the polymer state and then pyrolyzed to produce different types of ceramics. Cellular ceramics can be manufactured using this technique. Herein, the novel fabrication of cellular ceramics with a two-step process using PDCs is reported."
