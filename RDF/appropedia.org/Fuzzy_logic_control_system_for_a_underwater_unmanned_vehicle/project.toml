function = "In some scenario of human underwater activity, it is too dangerous for crew members to manipulate the underwater vehicle. At this circumstance, underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) is needed. To maintain the stable movement of the UUV, a robust control system is specifically needed. One of the most mature control system for UUV uses PID control as feedback control. PID control is an autonomous control method, it provide robust control against disturbance."
