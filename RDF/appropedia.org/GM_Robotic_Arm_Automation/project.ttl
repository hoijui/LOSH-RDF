    okh:function "The Open Source Hardware Enterprise from Michigan Technological University is working on the DEXTER robot arm project. It is sponsored by General Motors and was started in Fall 2017. The goal of this project is to automate the 3D printing process. It started when the OSHE was asked by the university to print hundreds of husky statues that took 8 hours each to print. Instead of having to remember to come into the lab every eight hours and start a new print, it would be much easier if the process was automatic." ;
