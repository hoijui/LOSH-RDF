This article describes PACMAC, a card-based cooperative card game aimed at introducing dabblers to hypothesis and falsifiability concepts through the visualization of a social perception map. The game was evaluated in five neighborhoods in El Salvador. The results showed that PACMAP is approachable for participants of different demographics to develop an understanding of the concepts of hypotheses and falsifiability.   == Required materials == Deck of cards Pen and pad Computer to run the script Projector   == How to play == A person from the group is selected as moderator and given the decks of cards facing down."
