    okh:function "At the begining of the semester our group was going to do a different project. We were going to help redesign the oncampus composting program at Humboldt State University, emphasizing the dorms. Our clients were plant ops, Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT), and the on campus recycling program (CRP). At the begining our clients were very intersted in our help, and we collaborated in a few meetings, but for some reason our attempts to make further meetings and to begin were ignored until the begining of October. We were told of a scheduled meeting at the last minute and at the meeting we were told that they decided to do the project at a later date." ;
