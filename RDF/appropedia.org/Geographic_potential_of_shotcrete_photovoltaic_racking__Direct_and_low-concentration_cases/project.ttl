    okh:function "Relentless cost declines in solar photovoltaic (PV) modules have radically reduced system costs, but the result is that racking costs have become more important. In this study a new open source racking method using earth and shotcrete-based ground mounts is investigated in two geographic regions: (1) Boa Vista, Brazil, where PV rows have an optimized shallow tilt angle and can be close-packed and (2) Kingston, Canada, where racks can make use of low concentration in the required inter-row spacing. Models are developed for both locations with single, double and triple vertical stacked shotcrete-based ground-mounted PV racking systems. Using these models bills of materials and energy simulations are produced to provide a cost benefit analysis specifically for the shotcrete racks. The results show that for utility-scale PV systems near the equator, a shotcrete racking system could reduce racking costs by 18â€“22% from the least expensive conventional racking and as much as 47% reduction for more expensive commercial racking." ;
