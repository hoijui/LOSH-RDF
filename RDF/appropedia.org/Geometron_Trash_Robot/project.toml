function = "The project documented here consists of three parts, which will ultimately be documented separately but which are presently going to be in one article, focusing just on the Trash Robot to get started. Geometron is a geometric programming language. It uses symbols, written in the language itself, to represent geometric actions either by a physical machine or by a geometric virtual machine if it is in software. Trash Robot is a system for using upcycled materials to build robotics for manufacturing in a \"two and a half d printing\" system to be described below. What is documented here, specifically, is a printer for printing coins out of clay built from a Raspberry pi, some simple electronics, and some cardboard and plastic trash."
