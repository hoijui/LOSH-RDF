function = "== Problem being addressed == Tuberculosis is the second largest infectious cause of death in the world. It is highly prevalent in low resource settings because the equipment necessary, fluorescence microscopes, is high cost ($40,000 USD), leading to difficulty in properly diagnosing the infection.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Global Focus Microscope analyses sputum smears (saliva and mucus mixture coughed up by a patient) to detect the presence of tuberculosis and malaria. The device is portable (small size and weight), is battery operated, has up to 1000x magnification, and is a low cost option ($240 USD to manufacture).   == Designed by == Designed by: Andrew Miller - Rice University, Houston, TX Manufacturer (if different): 3rd Stone Design Manufacturer location: San Rafael, California   == When and where it was tested/implemented == Tested in Tehran, Iran in 2010."
