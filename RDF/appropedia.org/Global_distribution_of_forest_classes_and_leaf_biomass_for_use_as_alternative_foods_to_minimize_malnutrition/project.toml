function = "Due to the ready availability of tree leaves in many geographies, the alternative food of leaf concentrate currently has the potential to alleviate hunger in over 800 million people. It is therefore potentially highly impactful to determine the edibility of leaf concentrates, which are in the same regions as the world's most undernourished populations. Unfortunately, the toxicity of leaf concentrate for most common tree leaf types has not been screened and the cost of doing so demands a prioritization. This preliminary study explores this potential solution to world hunger by finding the forest classes most likely to offer proximate access to the world's hungry, thus providing the basis for a prioritized list of leaf types to screen for toxicity. Specifically, this study describes a novel methodology for mapping available green leaf biomass and corresponding forest classes (e.g., tropical moist deciduous forest), and their spatial relationship to the global distribution of people who are underweight."
