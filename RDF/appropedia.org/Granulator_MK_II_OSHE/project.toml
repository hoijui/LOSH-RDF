function = "This project was developed mainly by Walker Nelson Peter Gorecki, who finished their capstone design project through Michigan Technological University in 2016. Since its publishing, the Granulator design and assembly itself has not changed, but information regarding the power consumption while granulating different thermoplastics has been researched. This Wiki page contains a link to the website where the project files and initial description are hosted, and updates for this project for the future.   == All relevant files == As said in the Background and Introduction; all original files (CAD, construction, report, simulation) can be accessed on this site *plastic granulator Files relating to power consumption, or noise reduction are located on this page   == Fall 2019 == After feedback on the design, we will be redesigning portions of the granulator to improve the machine's efficiency. The main change we will be looking at making will to have a pipe that encloses the granulation blades for 270 degrees of rotation."
