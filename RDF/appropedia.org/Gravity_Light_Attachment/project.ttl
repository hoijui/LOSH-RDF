    okh:function "Gravity Light Attachment for Crank Flashlight. This is a attachment device that utilizes the American Red Cross Clipray Crank-Powered Flashlight that turns the crank device into a gravity light. The need that this fulfills is to provide light to any area without the need for a power/electrical hookup, as well as possibly providing a way to charge a phone in a certain situation. There is a commercial production of this item, but it is a bit expensive and does not allow you to charge your phone. Pictures of the black light frame are V1, when printing, utilize V2, which is the working model in the youtube video   == Bill of Materials == 1." ;
