function = "There are many ways to convert and use energy. Energy stems from two basic forms; Potential energy, energy that is not yet active and Kinetic energy, energy which comes from the motion of things. This includes energy from our own bodies to do work. Instead of using our own potential energy, our modern day society has switched to using energy harvested from other sources such as fossil fuels. For example instead of using our own energy to walk up a flight of stairs, most Americans chose to use the elevator.\nenergy generation"
