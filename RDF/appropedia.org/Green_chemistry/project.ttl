    okh:function "Green chemistry , also known as sustainable chemistry, refers to environmentally friendly chemicals and processes that result in: reduced waste, eliminating costly end-of-the-pipe treatments; safer products; and reduced use of energy and resourcesâ€”all improving the competitiveness of chemical manufacturers and their customers. It includes:  Design of alternative synthetic pathways for new or existing chemicals which do not utilize toxic reagents or solvents or do not produce toxic by-products or co-products. Design or redesign of useful chemicals and materials such that they are less toxic to health and the environment or safer with regard to accident potential. Appropriate areas of investigation[expansion needed] include: chemical synthesis and catalysis; analysis and detection; separation processes; and reaction mechanisms. Examples include:  Use of innovative methods such as catalysis and biocatalysis; photochemistry or biomimetic synthesis; and use of alternative starting materials which are innocuous or renewable." ;
