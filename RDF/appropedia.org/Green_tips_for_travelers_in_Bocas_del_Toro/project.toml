function = "Bocas del Toro, Panama is a popular tourist destination. It is an archipelago located in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of northeastern Panama. The Bocas Sustainable Tourism Alliance suggests has the following tips for travelers looking to reduce the impact of their visit:  Despite the huge amount of rainfall in this region, fresh water is in very short supply. Be aware of your usage when traveling â€“ take short showers, re-use towels and linen at hotels, and team up with other travelers to wash a full laundry load. Trash is often dumped or burned, so recycle as much as you possibly can."
