function = "An adaptation of the basic solar still, the Greenhouse Solar Still design is particularly suited for disaster areas but can also be used as a permanent water source. It's only requirement in most cases is a single roll of polyethylene plastic. This is easily delivered by air drop to devastated areas and instructions for construction are simple enough for graphical representation. Requirements are:  One roll of polyethylene plastic at least twenty feet in width and preferably one hundred feet long. With larger sizes, weight becomes a factor."
