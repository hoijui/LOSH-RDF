function = "All industrial processes generate waste. The form of this waste can be in discarded items, unused materials, or waste energy which is not used for the creation of the end product. However, items that are seen as waste and a liability to one company are in many cases seen as useful inputs to other industrial processes. An industrial system which takes advantage of this principle can go by many names but is generally described as industrial ecology, or industrial symbiosis, wherein traditionally disparate industries can work together to produce environmental and financial benefits for both companies. There have been many successful industrial symbiosis projects worldwide, and the purpose of this project is to highlight another potential symbiosis, with the combination of flat glass manufacturing and tomato greenhouse agriculture."
