function = "A detailed greywater system at Centro Orgánico Finca Sarita, an Ecuadorian seed saving center. This greywater treatment system was built in Ecuador, using a grease trapW as the first stage, followed by a gravel bed with native plants. As a member of la Red de Guardianes de Semillas (the Seed Savers' Network), a grassroots Ecuadoran organization dedicated to the preservation of the traditional seed and the culture that it sustains, the Centro Orgánico Finca Sarita serves as a seed saving center for coastal Ecuador as well as an educational model in sustainable farming and ancestral living in its region.   == Greywater filtration system ==  Along the lines of serving as a sustainable model within their community and region, coordinators of Finca Sarita were looking for a low-cost, model greywater filtration system built from local materials that could be easily maintained, repaired, and mimicked. Considering the region's abundance of native aquatic plants and its plethera of dirt and rocks, it seemed only appropriate to utilize a greywater marsh design to fill the coordinators' desires, this and no other center in la Red has incorporated this design into their model."
