function = "This ground collector is based on the nut, golf ball, tennis ball, or fruit collectors that are on the market. Simply put, a rolling cage is affixed to the end of a broom stick and is pushed across the ground. Any object that is on the ground pushes apart the wires of the cage and is trapped inside. The ground collector consists of 3D printed parts, hanger wire, dowel rods, and a broom stick. The FreeCAD Files are included in the YouMagine page so anyone can edit the files and use any size wire, dowel rod, and broom stick."
