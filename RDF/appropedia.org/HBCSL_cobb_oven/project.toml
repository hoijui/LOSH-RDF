function = "This cob oven was built in Spring of 2011 at the up and coming Manila Eco Hostel just west of Arcata, CA. The Humboldt Bay Center for Sustainable Living and DANCO Construction are jointly restoring a house to serve as an alternative hostel that is renovated using sustainable and energy efficiency principles. We built a wood fired cob oven out of recycled and locally harvested materials that will eventually be integrated with a fully functioning outdoor kitchen. We intend this oven to serve as a learning and experiential opportunity for travelers and to of course be used to cook delicious breads, pizzas, cakes and other baked goods.   == Cobb basics == Cob was widely used in Europe in the 16th through the 19th centuries and many of the structures built using this material continue to stand and are still in use today. Cob is a simple mixture of clay, sand, straw and water."
