function = "This spring 2011 semester, we constructed a passive thermosyphon solar shower system that utilizes natural temperature stratification to heat and store water without natural gas or electricity. Constructed at the Manila Eco-Hostel, this is an educational piece that seeks to inspire travelers of the area to recreate such a project in their own community.   == Background == Continuing on the design for the Samoa Hostel Thermosyphon Solar Shower System, designed by previous Engineering 215 students at Humboldt State University, we have constructed a solar shower at the Manila Eco Hostel. This shower uses a solar water heating panel to heat water for an outdoor, enclosed shower, providing visitors with an aesthetically pleasing, functioning way to shower sustainably.   == Opportunity Definition == The objective is to demonstrate, educate, and inspire an alternative way of heating water to visitors of the eco-hostel."
