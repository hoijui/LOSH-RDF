    okh:function "Students will have the opportunity to work with the McKinleyville High School (MHS) students and the Humboldt County Office of Education (HCOE) to design lectures tailored to appropriate technology. During the Spring 2017 semester Caroline Stoddard and Kelsey Summers will design a bike power project and corresponding educational curriculum to be delivered in McKinleyville, CA once per week. The intent is to design and construct a bicycle capable of producing electricity. The goal of the class is to provide students with strengths in hands on activities while working to serve the community. This pedal power project also has the potential to provide future curriculum ideas for bike power service learning projects." ;
