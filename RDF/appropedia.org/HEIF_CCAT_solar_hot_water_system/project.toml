function = "The purpose of this page is to describe the solar hot water system used by the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) on the campus of Humboldt State University (HSU).   == CCAT Overview == Developed as a live in laboratory for sustainability, the student run, student funded, and student staffed organization is now located in a residential style house on the south side of campus(Figure 1). Since becoming an associated students program in 1980, CCAT has been organized around the goal of providing appropriate technology information to the public. One example of appropriate technology featured at CCAT is the solar hot water system, which provides hot water for the entire house using the thermal energy from the sun and is considered to be the most functionally efficient system still operating at CCAT as of October 2011.   == Solar Hot Water System ==  In July of 2009, two solar-thermal cells were installed on the roof of the CCAT house and connected to the water heater for the building."
