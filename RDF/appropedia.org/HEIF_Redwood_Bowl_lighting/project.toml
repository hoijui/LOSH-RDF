function = "Humboldt State University is changing the lighting system around the Redwood Bowl sports field in order to reduce emissions, light pollution, and energy consumption. Students of the Green Campus Programor (GCP) wrote a proposal that was submitted to the Humboldt Energy Independence Fund in spring 2009 to gain interest in the subject of retrofitting the Redwood Bowl. This site is dedicated for everyone interested in understanding the current lighting, future lighting, and reasons for retrofit.   === Green Campus Program === The Green Campus Program is a movement directed toward students to lead energy efficient campains at their university.
