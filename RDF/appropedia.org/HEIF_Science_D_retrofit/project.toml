function = "The purpose of this page is to explain how retrofits made to a building at Humboldt State University(HSU) located on B St between Laurel and 17th St in Arcata CA, http://www.humboldt.edu/humboldt/aday/documents/HSUcampusmap.pdf can reduce energy and fossil fuel consumption. Students wrote a grant proposal to the Humboldt Energy Independence Fund(HEIF) with the goal of improving energy efficiency on campus. The Sci D/E complex includes the science and engineering building as well as the greenhouse at Humboldt State University. The building (Sci D/E complex) was originally designed by Ratcliff Architects. Paul Wright and William Lowe were the contractors for the project."
