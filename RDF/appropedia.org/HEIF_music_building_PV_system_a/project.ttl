    okh:function """The purpose of this page is to describe the photovoltaic system on Music Building A at Humboldt State University(HSU), which harnesses a renewable source of energy to generate electricity on campus; this project is sponsored by the Humboldt Energy Independence Fund(HEIF), an entirely student-funded organization.   == Project Purpose == The Old Music Building Photovoltaic Project was one of the first projects of HEIF, the Humboldt State University Energy Independence Fund. HEIF members Kristen Radecsky, Peter Johnstone, James Robinson, and Nathan Chase proposed the project with the primary purpose of the PV system being the generation of enough electricity to power the music building through a renewable energy source. The PV project offers fiscal benefits for HSU by providing an expected 365,000 kW*hr over its lifetime, which otherwise would have to be purchased from Pacific Gas & Electric. The generation of electricity in this fashion reduces overall emissions resulting from campus energy demand.
