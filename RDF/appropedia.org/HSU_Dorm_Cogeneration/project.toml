function = "The cogeneration building is located in the front parking lot of the Jolly Giant Commons(JGC)(Figure 2). This building often has a few service vehicles outside and is closer to the forest wall on the left of the parking lot when looking at it from the road. After talking with a few HSU staff members, we tracked down the Maintenance Supervisor (housing and dining services) here at HSU, Tim Freeman, who kindly gave us a tour of the cogeneration system present here, on campus. Tim also provided us with useful information on how Cogeneration works.  The cogeneration Unit runs 24/7, and has been since its installation in 1987  Unlike the majority of other cogeneration facilities serving different functions, the system here at Humboldt produces hot water and ambient heating instead of heating and energy production."
