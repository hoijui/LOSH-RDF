This is an Environmental Science 411 (sustainable campus course): research project to provide supplementary information to address and support these decisions.   == History on the issues/sites involved == According to Tall Chief Comet, the Sustainability Director and Grounds Manager for Humboldt State University, the campus plans to add 400 new beds for student housing on campus. This will greatly expand the need for parking on campus, and well-planned parking infrastructure is essential to reducing stress associated with finding parking spots. Tall Chief Comet also informed us of future plans to repave parking lots, which will be an opportunity to install parking sensors." ;
