    okh:function "The future happened yesterday The Urban Rain Catchment System, or URCS is our first attempt at appropriate innovations towards sustainable existence. URCS is a very simple concept: Create a means of rain catchment that can be constructed and utilized by any person regardless of their access to modern amenities. The guiding principle behind URCS is to assuage the detriment of modern consumption and lifestyle on the environment, to which we owe everything.   == History ==  This rad system, URCS was conceived in the confined quarters of the Eco-Dorms of Humboldt State University. It all began with the creation of a small garden on our patio, which was being pummeled by water from our overflowing gutters." ;
