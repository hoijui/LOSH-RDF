A secondary goal is to create a recommendation that would improve the overall functionality of the policy. Another goal was to create compelling comparisons for consumers.   == Findings == This study of Mason jars, paper cups, and plastic cups compared three metrics: carbon dioxide emissions, embedded energy, and cost."
