The client leads on this project are  Morgan King, Sustainability & Waste Coordinator Katie Koscielak, Sustainability Analyst Ron Rudebock, Director of Dining Services The objective of this project is to analyze and compare the effects of the HSU policy and pricing regarding mason jars and disposables in terms of its monetary costs, carbon dioxide emissions, and embedded energy. A secondary goal is to create a recommendation that would improve the overall functionality of the policy. Another goal was to create compelling comparisons for consumers.   == Findings == This study of Mason jars, paper cups, and plastic cups compared three metrics: carbon dioxide emissions, embedded energy, and cost." ;
