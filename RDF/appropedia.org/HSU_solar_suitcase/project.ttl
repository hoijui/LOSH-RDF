    okh:function """Our group was given the opportunity to work with the non-profit organization We Share Solar to assemble solar suitcases and teach a class about them as well. These solar suitcases are off-grid solar powered kits that provide light and charging capabilities to places with no access to electricity. Throughout our project, we assembled several small solar suitcases, as well as two big ones that we are sending back to We Share Solar and eventually will be sent to a community who needs them. We also ran a lab with our engineering class, using the instruction manuals provided as well as a power point presentation we created to go along with it, where we helped our peers assemble the solar suitcases so they could learn about off-grid solar systems.   == Background == Many schools, health centers, and other medical or humanitarian operations need better lighting, batteries, and device chargers that are portable and reliable.
