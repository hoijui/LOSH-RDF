    okh:function "There are a few composting toilets at Haiti Communitere. The image to the right is of an Ubuntu Blox composting toilet made with support from Give Love. A bucket is placed underneath the toilet seat, and after every use some dried sugar cane shavings from a local rum factory are tossed into the bucket. Every week SOIL comes to Haiti Communitere to take the buckets of waste from them. They turn the waste into compost and sell it to farmers and gardeners." ;
