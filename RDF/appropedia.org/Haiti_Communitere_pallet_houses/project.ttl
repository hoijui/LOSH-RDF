Haiti Communitere is a resource center that facilitates projects with the intent to influence positive development in Haiti. These pallet houses are an example of how old \"waste\" material can be upcycled to created useful materials or structures. Each pallet house was constructed using pallet wood. They were built on top of a shipping container, and both have a unique aesthetic that makes them appealing." ;
