    okh:function "The straw bale house at Haiti Communitere was built by Builders Without Boarders. It was made entirely out of locally sourced materials. Straw bales from local rice fields were used as an insulation layer in the walls. The walls were finished with a natural plaster. The foundation was made with rubble from the 2010 Haiti earthquake and gravel bags made with tarps collected and sewn by people in earthquake affected regions." ;
