    okh:function "The Elephant Foot in Haiti Communitere is a demonstration piece for a style of building that utilizes concrete, tires, and rebar to make earthquake resistant wall foundations. The Elephant Foot was created by Architecture Sans Fronti√®res. Tires can absorb a lot of the movement and stress caused by earthquakes. When used as a building material they can make earthquake safe foundations, while at the same time upcyling a material that would otherwise be waste. Large shake table tests are needed to confirm the structural integrity of the Elephant Foot, but one wall was tested on the bed of a moving truck at Haiti Communitere, and it survived without damage." ;
