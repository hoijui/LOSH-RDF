    okh:function "This Appropedia Web page was originally dedicated to creating an appropriate technology emergency response to the earthquake in Haiti by HSU students enrolled in Appropriate Technology Engineering-305 spring 2018. Students enrolled in other college courses for which the instructor is willing to extend class credit are also invited to participate. This page is being maintained by Bart Orlando See Projects_with_Bart Many of the essential needs of the earthquake survivors in Haiti can be provided for using appropriate technology: geodesic storm-shelter domes, alternative tent shelters, alternative tensile shade structures, drinking water solar thermal pasteurization units, solar cookers, anerobic digester bags for converting human waste to methane fuel, solar charged night lighting, solar electric telecommunications, solar shower units, human powered-power tools and alternative systems emergency humanitarian aid delivery (Gigantic Solar/Electric Cargo-Airships). Appropriate Technology can make a difference in the lives of those it touches. This is our opportunity to demonstrate to the world what could be done!" ;
