function = "This OSAT project is a carpenter's hammer. In order to be heavy enough and duable enough to drive nails, a bolt is used for the hammering surface. The resulting product is a very strong hammer that can drive and remove nails. This hammer is an appropriate OSAT because a hammer is one of the most basic and necessary tools to build a structure. A hammer like this would be easy to print, low cost, and fill a real need for a developing area."
