    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Water-related diseases kill millions of people each year. For example, diarrheal disease was ranked fifth in the list of causes of premature mortality in South Africa in 2000. Hand washing can serve as an effective barrier to several of the transmission routes of diarrheal pathogens. Many people in rural areas do not wash their hands after using the “toilet” simply because they do not have easy access to water or hand-washing supplies.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Hand-washing Device (HWD) is a self-closing tap fixed to the outside of a toilet." ;
