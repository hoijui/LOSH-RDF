    okh:function "This is a 3D printable hand drill which can be used to drill holes in any soft material such as wood. This design is based largly of old antique hand drills seen here. This drill is almost completely 3D printable aside from the drill bit.   == Bill of Materials == PLA or ABS Filament (1.75mm) All of the STL files are here. Drill Bit OR Piece of flat metal to be used as drill bit (~3mm X ~10mm X ~75mm)   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Knife/Exacto Knife Soldering iron (optional) File/Grinding device/knife sharpener/rough stone/similar object Flame creating object (ex: candle/lighter/burning stick)   == Assembly Instructions ==   === Drill Bit === Use a file or other abrasive material to file a point on piece of metal to be used as the drill bit Add re-leaf angels to the back side of the taper Exact angles are not necessary but try to keep the drill bit symmetric   === Drill === 3D print all of the pieces Assemble all of the pieces as shown Use a small amount of 1.75mm filament to fasten the parts together Use soldering iron to secure filament in place this will prevent the drill from falling apart If a soldering iron is unavailable heating the end of the drill bit with or other piece of metal with a flame will suffice It is recommended to not completely secure the drill bit adapter.(this allows to easily change bits with out the need of a new drill)   === Installing the drill bit === CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN HANDLING HOT OBJECTS Use a flame of some sort to heat up the back end of the drill bit hot enough to melt plastic Carefully align the rill bit with the opening in the bit adapter Firmly insert the HOT drill bit into the bit adapter NOTE: the plastic in the bit adapter should melt and deform as the bit is inserted Hold Dill bit sturdy until the plastic becomes firm Allow the drill and drill bit to completely cool before use   == Cost savings == If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate." ;
