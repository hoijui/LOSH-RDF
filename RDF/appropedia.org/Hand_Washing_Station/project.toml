function = "Hand washing is an essential part to maintain proper hygiene and to prevent the spread of sickness. In places that do not have access to running water do not have the ability to frequently wash their hands and increase the chance of sickness to spread. With a portable easy to use unit that uses a limited amount of water to be able to have in a village or house in a place with out access to running water could help prevent spread of sicknesses. Current solution is to use a larger jug hanging from a tree for a small town or village to share.   == Bill of Materials == PLA Plastic Filament - Approx: 200g Cost: ~$4 Rubber O-Rings - 2: 3/4\" ID x 15/161\" OD Cost: $1 Electrical Tap - 4\" Cost:$0.25 Common Used Bottle 12oz to 2L - Garbage Cost: Free Total Cost: $5.25   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Used 2 Liter Bottle Holder by (c) 2013 Laird Popkin, based on http://www.threadspecs.com/assets/Threadspecs/ISBT-PCO-1881-Finish-3784253-18.pdf."
