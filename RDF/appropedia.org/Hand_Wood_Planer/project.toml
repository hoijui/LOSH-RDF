function = "The hand wood planer is designed for making medium to detailed design cuts on wood. Typically, these cuts are low stress on the handle, so printing out of PLA is acceptable for the design. Wood planers, hand and electric, have been around for a long time. Although they have been around for a while, the price for either a hand or electric planer has not gone down, and in fact remains expensive in comparison to other tools. This woodworking tool is commonly used by carpenters to make small cuts and level off surfaces."
