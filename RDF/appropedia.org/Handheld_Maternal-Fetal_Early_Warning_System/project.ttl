    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == In the poorest countries, there are 500 million maternal deaths, 3.2 million still births, and 4 million neonatal deaths each year. To prevent mortality, early detection of preeclampsia, labor dystocia, and the presence of preterm labor are important for determining possible hazards.   == Detailed description of the solution == To detect problems with the mother and fetus during pregnancy, a system of reusable capacitive sensors and smart phones may be used to detect the presence of potential ailments. The device is a maternal-fetal monitoring system that aides medical personnel in decision-making. Once ailments are detected the patients may be sent to the proper facilities for treatment." ;
