    okh:function "The purpose of this design is to allow people to grow fruits, vegetables, and herbs close to their home with minimal space and water usage. The basic design are buckets that can be suspended by any rope over each other with holes in the bottom to allow excess water in each bucket to spill through and water the next plant below. This design will allow people in contries with limited space and water to still be able to have a small garden to help provide food for their family. This garden also allows for the growth of flowers and other plants to decorate any house.   == Bill of Materials ==  All files can be found at: YouMagine   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Print as many buckets as desired using any hard filament (PLA or ABS) keeping in mind that each bucket will take around 8 hours and 30 minutes to print Cut a section of rope that allows space for the amount of buckets printed plus the plant that will be growing in it Thread the rope through the holes on the sides of the bucket from inside to outside and tie a tight knot on the outside of each side making sure the bucket will hang level Plant desired fruits, vegetables, herbs, or flowers within the pots Hang the garden by tying the top of the rope to the rafters or a curtain rod Water top plant as often as needed allowing excess to drip to lower pots." ;
