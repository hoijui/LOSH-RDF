    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Newborns that are unable to breathe on their own require mechanical assistance to breathe in order to survive long enough to develop their lungs. The cost of mechanical ventilators however, precludes their extensive use in resource-limited settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Hansen Ventilator reduces the price and complexity of ventilators by using columns of water to control the pressure of the air instead of complex mechanical mechanisms. The ventilator can be created from off-the-shelf components and costs a fraction of the price of conventional ventilators.   == Designed by == Designed by: Dr." ;
