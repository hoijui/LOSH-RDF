    okh:function "Sheet metal is often available as scrap from car wrecks, roof sheets, and the better parts of rusted-through oil drums. There is much local experience working with sheet metal. The setup of many designs can be based on the use of sheet metal, as its special application can be derived from what is already general known.   == How? == Sheet metal can be cut and bent without expensive machines; a hammer along with simple hand tools such as a machete, knife, or axe will do the job." ;
