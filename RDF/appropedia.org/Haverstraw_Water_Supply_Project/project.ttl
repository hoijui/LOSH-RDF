    okh:function "Haverstraw Water Supply Project I.	Overview Rockland County has encountered phases of inadequate water supply since the 1990s, due to periodic drought and increasing demand from population growth. The New York State Public Service Agreement called upon United Water, the region's drinking water supplier, to develop a new source water to meet growing demand as part of a three-year rate plan for Rockland County. United Water proposed the Haverstraw Water Supply Project, a desalination plant in the Hudson River that was met with protest and debate among the residents of Rockland County and environmental watchdog organizations. Many citizens and environmentalist groups are concerned that desalination would be costly for consumers and the environment, and would require large amounts of energy and emit greenhouse gases [1]. The resultant water quality has also been called into question." ;
