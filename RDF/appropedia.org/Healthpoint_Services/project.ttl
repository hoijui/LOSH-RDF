    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Healthcare delivery in rural areas of India is often inefficient and ineffective. Due to a lack of skilled medical professionals, effective diagnostic tools, and clean water in these remote areas, women, suffer from entirely preventable negative health outcomes. Thus, there is a need for innovative, quality primary maternal healthcare delivery in rural regions of India.   == Detailed description of the solution == Healthpoint Services seeks to take advantage of its already established electronic healthcare system, based upon communication and information technology and social marketing to bring modern, high quality maternal healthcare to rural India. EHPs, or electronic health points, are village healthcare centers that provide a variety of services, most notably in the realm of telemedicine." ;
