    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide and women who suffer are often in need of blood transfusions as they lose considerable amounts of blood. Autologous blood transfusion is an important technique used in resource-poor settings where there are often shortages of donated blood. This method essentially involves physically extracting patients’ blood and re-infusing it back into their bodies through a gauze filter. However, this “soup ladle” model is slow, lacks in sterility and filtering efficacy, is labor-intensive, and potentially dangerous for patients, often resulting in complications related to acute anemia.   == Detailed description of the solution == Hemafuse is a simple and affordable handheld mechanical device that allows physicians to manually suction blood from women’s abdomens, quickly filter out blood clots and impurities, and re-tranfuse it using a standard blood bag." ;
