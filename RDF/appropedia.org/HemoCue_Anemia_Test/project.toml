function = "== Problem being addressed == Anemia is one of the leading maternal health problems of the developing world. Detection of the condition can prevent numerous other complications including hemorrhage, the leading cause of maternal deaths worldwide. There is a need for simple, robust, and effective anemia diagnostic devices in low-resource settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == The HemoCue Hemobglobin system is a portable, battery-operated device that tests for anemia in pregnant women. A disposable microcuvette is placed within the blood specimen, which collects the correct amount of blood via capillary action and automatically mixes the sample with reagents."
