function = "== Problem being addressed == Women during childbearing years are particularly susceptible to anemia. There are an estimated 100,000 maternal and 600,000 newborn deaths a year due to the blood disorder, with millions more affected. Thus far, it has been difficult to influentially screen for anemia in developing countries because it requires individual testing, a process that is time consuming and unrealistic in low-resource facilities.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Hemoglobe is an inexpensive phone attachment that transforms rural health workersâ€™ phones into non-invasive and prick-free hemoglobinometers. They automatically relay hemoglobin results to a central server in order to map out anemia prevalence and where help is needed most, geographically."
