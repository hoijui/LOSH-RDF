    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Early detection of hemorrhage can lead to better treatment and better outcomes for women in postpartum stress. Anemia is an early indicator of postpartum hemorrhage, but many methods of measurement are expensive and/or invasive, which can cause further infection or bleeding.   == Detailed description of the solution == This is a simple laboratory test strip that requires a drop of blood on an absorbent test strip. By comparing the color of the drop of blood to a booklet with possible shades of red, the user can assess the presence and severity of anemia.   == Designed by == While this is a widely commercial laboratory tool, it was designed for detection of anemia in pregnant women by WHO with help from PATH. Manufacturer: It is now manufactured by Copack in Germany, licensed by WHO.   == When and where it was tested/implemented == The Hemoglobin Color Scale (HbCS) became commercially available in 2011." ;
