    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == The Hemopurifier™ has been developed to address the treatment of drug and vaccine-resistant pathogens, including Ebola & HIV which causes AIDS.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Hemopurifier™ is a dialysis-type medical device designed to mimic the natural immune response of clearing infectious viruses and toxins before the occurrence of cell and organ infection. Human in-vitro blood studies have documented a rapid capture of circulating HIV and gp120, a toxic surface protein known to deplete the immune T-cells required to fight off infection. If commercialized, the Hemopurifier™ would represent the first medical device enlisted as a treatment for HIV/AIDS.   == Designed by == Design: Aethlon Medical, Inc. Manufacturer Location: San Diego, California, USA   == When and where it was tested/implemented == Testing has been done in the United States since 2001. It is currently being tested in human clinical trials in India." ;
