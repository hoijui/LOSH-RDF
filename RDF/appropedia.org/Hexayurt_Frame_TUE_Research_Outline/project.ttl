    okh:function "The Hexayurt is a design pattern for making simple six sided shelters which are like the Mongolian Yurt from a variety of common industrial materials. Two basic families of Hexayurts exist - those made from panel materials, and those made from beams. The design is simple enough that construction close to or even in disaster areas seems likely. This creates the possibility of large scale shelter construction using materials common in the industrial supply chain. The Hexayurt has been field tested by the US Department of Defense, and the American and Netherlands Red Cross have show strong interest in the design." ;
