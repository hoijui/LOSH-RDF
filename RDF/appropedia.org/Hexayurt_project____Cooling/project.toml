function = "When the Hexayurt is used in a hot climate it will get hot inside. The heat comes from four sources:  Solar gains due to sunlight warming the fabric Fabric heat gains due to outside air being hotter than inside air Ventilation heat gains due to incoming air being hotter than the inside air.* Heat from people and equipment in the Hexayurt. The Hexayurt has good insulation. It is highly reflective (when new and clean) so it reflects most of the solar energy. However it has very low thermal mass so that, with no air conditioning, it will heat up when the sun is out."
