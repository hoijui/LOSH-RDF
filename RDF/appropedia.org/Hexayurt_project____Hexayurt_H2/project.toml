function = "A Hexayurt H2 is a hexayurt-style structure with space for a single person or cozy couple and a few personal effects, nothing more. It is roughly the size of a single person hiking tent or a capsule hotel. The footprint is 4' x 8' with a height of 41 inches (a 6' person can sit straight inside).   = Materials = 2 structural panels (polyiso, plywood or cardboard as appropriate for a hexayurt) plastic or canvas tarp larger than 8' x 4' 1 roll bi-directional filament tape 1 roll duct tape Optional: 1 roll foil tape The tarp is for the floor. In a hot environment (ie: Burning Man), the floor should be non-insulating so the ground acts as a temperature regulator."
