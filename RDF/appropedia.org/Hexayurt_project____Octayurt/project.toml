function = "Full design specs and instructions are here on Google Docs. [please post an image or pdf here, or something - Google Docs is worse than useless] The Octayurt is big enough for two people, including their gear, and very comfortably sleeps up to three people. Pros: This smaller design requires only six 8'x4' panels, half of the amount required for the Classic Hexayurt.  Cons: It requires more cuts and taping per panel than the Classic Hexayurt.  The footprint of the Octayurt is 9.66' x 9.66', yielding about 77 square feet of floorspace."
