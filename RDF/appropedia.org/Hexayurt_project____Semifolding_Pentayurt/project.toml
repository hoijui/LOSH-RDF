If you have not done so, read Camp Danger Hexayurt Hinge Technique first.   == The Challenge of Five Sides == There are two differences between a Hexayurt and a Pentayurt that impact the semi-folding design. A Pentayurt has an odd number of sides. This means splitting the yurt in half will not result in identical parts as it does with a Hexayurt."
