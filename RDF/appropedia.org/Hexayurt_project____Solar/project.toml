function = "Substitute for national grid or heavyweight solar with:  One 80 watt panel connected to a 15 minute AA battery charger (e.g. the new generation Rayovacs) These items will be connected into a \"power pillar\" - a walk-up charging station where people come with their empty NIMH batteries, drop them into the charger, wait 15 minutes, then take them home. Assuming a 10 hour charging day, that services 40 sets of batteries. Each AA NiMH battery has a capacity of approx 2000 mAh at 1.25V, equivalent to 2.5 VAh. If charger efficiencies are 25% (my guess) then we need about 10 Wh to charge each battery."
