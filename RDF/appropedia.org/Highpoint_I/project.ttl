    okh:function "The Highpoint I apartment building, built in England in 1935, is modern-looking, forward thinking for its time, and widely praised.   == Shared spaces == The shared spaces did not work as planned. The plan for its foyer areas to function as a social forum never worked in practice. Neither was the roof terrace (an important element in Le Corbusier's theory of modern architecture) furnished or greatly used, though it was originally intended to be.   == Pricing out the workers ==  Though designed for workers, the quality of its design led to its apartments being sought after by the middle class." ;
