If the printer is not calibrated exactly, then the hinges will have a lot of friction, or may cause trailing and may not fit together properly.  May want to consider adding to the two hinge parts a C style clamp option, if good screws are not possible to come by for the user. This would allow them to simply require the seven bolts or pins to fasten the door to the hinge." ;
