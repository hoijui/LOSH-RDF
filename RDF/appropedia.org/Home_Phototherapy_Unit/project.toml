function = "== Problem being addressed == Jaundice in newborns is an extremely common condition that can result in kernicterus (brain damage) or even death without medical treatment. Resource-limited areas often lack the equipment necessary to treat this condition with phototherapy. In addition, phototherapy systems are generally large so they cannot be transported, causing newborns to extend their stay in hospitals.   == Detailed description of the solution == The home phototherapy unit is a small, portable device that can treat jaundice in newborns at home. The light waves transform toxic bilirubin in the newbornâ€™s blood into a safer product."
