function = "The design of most biogas systems can be traced to either the China Fixed Dome (CFD) 6+ million in-use or the India Floating Cover (IFC) 2.9+ million in-use. The Philippine BioDigester Home Biogas System (HBS)  is a product of both designs. It is:  Easier to build Less expensive, and Simpler to operate and maintain (clean & repair) It can be built as a :  Do-It-Yourself (DIY) project where expert masonry skills are not required Using common and inexpensive materials available anywhere. Biogas production from pig manure where 1-2 pigs excrete 1L (L=liter)  20L/day = 250 Pesos biogas/month 40L/day = 500 Pesosbiogas/month 60L/day = 750 Pesosbiogas/month The plan described here is for an 8 cubic meter digester. It can produce up to 1,000 Pesos/month of biogas from 80L/day of pig manure.\nenergy, development, industry"
