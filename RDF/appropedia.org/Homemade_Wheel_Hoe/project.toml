function = "Make your own wheel hoe at a fraction of the cost of buying a new one. Wheel hoes are fantastic labor savors in larger gardens and organic farming. Unfortunately, they are still a boutique item and usually cost at least $150. Folks who are handy in the shop can build one from an old child's bicycle very inexpensively. Advantages:  Be more productive in the field Control weeds without chemicals Ability to cultivate more acreage Save money over purchasing new Re-purpose a bicycle meant for the landfill Custom size the unit for your specific situation   == Project goals == Inspire new builders of homemade wheel hoes Inspire new designs of wheel hoes   == Design == Start with a small-sized child's bicycle."
