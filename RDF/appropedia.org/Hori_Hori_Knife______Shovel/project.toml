function = "There are many great gardening tools in the world today, but one of the most useful in many ways is the hori hori knife. That's \"dig dig\" in Japanese.The hori hori has several uses. The blade's shape, compared to typical trowels, works very well for planting small transplants. The sharp edge can be used for a small hand ax or to cut open bags and other containers. The serrated edge can be used to cut through small roots, and the concave shape makes it easy to dig out weeds, even the tough ones."
