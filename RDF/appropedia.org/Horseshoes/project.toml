function = "Horseshoes may seem like a fairly common thing, but in third world, or developing countries, access to correctly sized, or new horseshoes can be extremely difficult. The goal is to provide any number of farmers, herders, or others access to custom, new horseshoes. While horses and other hooved animals have rather sturdy feet, it can be important to protect them from the environment, especially if they are going to be used for labor, or put under any kind of stress. These horseshoes can be modified for use with many different kinds of animals. Online, proper metal horseshoes can be found for as little as 3$."
