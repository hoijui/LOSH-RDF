function = "== Problem being addressed == Of the four million babies worldwide who die within the first month of life, a quarter die within 24 hours of birth. This is often because the infants are not provided with a consistent heat until they have the body fat and metabolic rate to stay warm. This is especially true for low-resource settings, where the majority of children are born at home and do not have the resources to provide their newborn with the necessary care immediately after birth.   == Detailed description of the solution == This hot water bottle incubator utilizes simple items, a water bottle, hot water, and blankets, to create a form of an incubator. The rigged incubator involves filling a plastic water bottle with hot water and placing them under blankets to help keep premature babies warm."
