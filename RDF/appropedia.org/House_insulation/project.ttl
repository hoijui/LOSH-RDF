    okh:function "The basic idea is to use the appropriate insulation within your home to save on heating and cooling costs. There are easy fixes and many new technologies in insulation that will prevent thermal loss year round. The expenses might seem high but will be able to pay for themselves in years and create a more energy efficient environment. This article will discuss the different options and procedures available.   == Physics Principles of Insulation ==   === Building Materials === Insulators  Choice ones that \"retard the flow of heat from one object to another\" High \"resistance to heat transfer Porous Materials are Great Insulators - This is due to the air in the pores acts as a \"Good insulator\" Choose darker objects = better emitter and absorber Darker objects > absorber/emitter than white Thermos = bottle inside a bottle - Device to reduce heat transfer - 2 bottles separated by a vacuum = > heat transfer from to inside chamber   == Types of Insulation == 4 BASIC TYPES OF INSULATION Loose-fill Insulation  Materials included in: loose fibers or fiber pellets Made of Cellulose fibers chemically treated to be moisture and fire resistent Fiberglass and Rock Wool = [Blow-in Blanket System] (BIBS) cost more then batt insulation Benefits/Positives Fills small cracks/crevices easier Reduces air Leakage better Better sound reducer (then batt insulation) R-3 to R-4 value per inch Cellulose fiber > (by 30%) then loose-fill rock wool Batt and Blanket Insulation  Materials Include: Made of Mineral Fibers (fiberglass or rock wool) Benefits/Positives Least expensive wall insulation material Best for Standard joist/rafters/studs Build in radiant barrier backing Come in long rolls that can be cut to desired length R-value of Approximately R-3 per inch thickness Rigid Board Insulation  Materials Include: Made from fiberglass, polystyrene, or polyurethane Benefits/Positives Come in variety of thicknesses R-value is the HIGHEST = R-4 to R-8 per inch Uses Reproofing work on flat roofs Basement Walls Perimeter insulation at concrete slab edges Cathedral Ceilings Must be covered with 1/2 inch gypsum board in used inside Must be covered with Weather-proof facing if used exteriorly Uses Insulate below floors, above ceilings, and within walls Spray Foam Insulation  Materials include: Two-part liquid containing polymer and foam agent Uses Sprayed on Wall, ceiling, and floor cavities Expands to sold cellular plastic with many air cavities Good for irregular shaped areas and around obstructions Negatives Require specific machinery to spray/mix If you need help determining the type of insulation, consult a contractor or try this site: http://web.archive.org/web/20130616194144/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/ins_08.htmlUS natural insulation comparison will also provide a good comparison of natural insulation for your benefit." ;
