function = "The purpose of this Mech425 project is to design a mechanically powered (Human powered) battery charger that will recharge low voltage batteries used for LED lighting. The reason it charges low voltage batteries is because a LED does not require much voltage to produce light. The lower the rated voltage of the battery that has to be recharged, the less work the human has to do in order to recharge it. The design should be efficient and cost effective to provide a means of charging batteries to those who may not be able to afford electricityW and or those who are in areas where electricity is unavailable. The design should also be made of materials that are easily available.\nenergy generation, charging battery"
