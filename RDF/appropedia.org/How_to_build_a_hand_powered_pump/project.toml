The main system currently used in several developing countries is a hand-operated pump since they are the most sustainable low cost option for safe water supply in resource poor settings. They are used for many purposes, industrial, marine, irrigation, and leisure activities. The hand pump being analyzed in this report is very cheap and easy to make, it can be seen in figure 1 below.
