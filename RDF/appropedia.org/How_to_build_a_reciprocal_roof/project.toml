function = "A reciprocal frame is a class of self-supporting structure made of three or more beams and which requires no center support to create roofs, bridges or similar structures. As quoted from Wikipedia.org. This page is intended to show the basic How-To's of installing a reciprocal roof on a structure. The reciprocal roof lends itself to round walled structures. This structure is a hexagon, although, an octagon, decagon, or vertex-less/circular one would make installation easier."
