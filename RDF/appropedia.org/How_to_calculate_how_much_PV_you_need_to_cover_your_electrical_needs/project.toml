function = "== Steps == Safety first. Determine your energy use - you can do this by collecting a year's worth of electric bills and adding up the energy (measured in kilo watt hours kW-hrs) used. Another way to do this is to do a plug load analysis of all of your electric devices: [math]\\displaystyle{ V=IR }[/math] Determine the solar insolation in your region and more specifically location of the pv panel to determine kW-hrs/kW installed of PV. This is done with your latitude or distance from the equator. Divide your energy use by the available solar insolation found from step 3 to get your number of maximum installed Watts. Design a pv system that meets your electrical power needs given the parameters of the available insolation."
