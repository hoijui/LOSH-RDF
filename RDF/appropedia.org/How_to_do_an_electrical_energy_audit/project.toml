function = "A home energy audit is a tally of all of the heat and electricity use in your house. This describes an electrical energy audit, in which you assess the electrical energy demand of the appliances in your home or work in order to find ways to reduce. Often this is done using a spreadsheet and an energy meter such as a KillAWatt.   == Why == Many conserve water by turning off faucets while brushing teeth and fixing leaks, but electricity is hard to see. An electrical home energy audit can help you understand your usage, conserve and even fix some leaks."
