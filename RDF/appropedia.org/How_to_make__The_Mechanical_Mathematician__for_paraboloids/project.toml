function = "Solar parabolic cooker with the mechanical mathematician! I now think that \"compound\" parabolic dishes have numerous advantages. (A compound parabolic solar cooker can also be made with the mathematician and I can add instructions later.) Use hardiplank, cardboard, plaster concrete or cob to make any size or shape parabolic reflector with this device! Solar cookers can be made from waste cardboard boxes covered with kitchen foil. Mostly people use math to figure out the parabola or use a template."
