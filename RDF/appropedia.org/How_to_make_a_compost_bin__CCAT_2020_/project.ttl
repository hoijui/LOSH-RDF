    okh:function "A community-sized composting system designed for The Community Center of Appropriate Technology (CCAT) at Humboldt State University in Arcata, CA. CCAT had a system in place that was not working for their desires and wanted to upgrade to a system that was more efficient and user-friendly. The design was developed to be self-serving and easy to use, with minimal labor. We developed different ideas, while prototyping to see what CCAT preferred and disliked. We settled on a 3 barrel system with rotating lids to have multiple batches of compost at one time, to keep a continuous rotation. As well as, a separate system in place for green waste made from the infrastructure of the previous composting system already in place." ;
