    okh:function "I originally made a compound parabolic solar cooker by making a mold from cob and then folding and cutting the dish directly over it. I thought this was the best solution because you can make as many cuts on the spot depending on the stiffness of your dish material. (Material that is hard to bend requires more cuts) but requests have come in for a template and this is the second attempt to make one.   == Video == I have made a compound parabolic solar cooker and it worked really well, heating food for up to 3 hours without moving the dish. I wish to spread the idea far and wide." ;
