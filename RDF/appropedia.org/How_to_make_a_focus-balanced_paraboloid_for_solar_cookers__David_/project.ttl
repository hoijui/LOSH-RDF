    okh:function """Recently, I was involved in a discussion of designs for a simple solar cooker. The obvious one has a symmetrical paraboloidal reflecting dish focusing sunlight onto the cooking pot which is located at the focal point of the paraboloid. The axis of symmetry of the paraboloid is aimed at the sun, so the dish has to rotate about a polar axis (one parallel with the earth's axis of rotation) at a speed of 15 degrees per hour in order to follow the sun's daily motion across the sky. This axis of rotation should pass through the cooking pot, at the focus of the dish, so the pot remains stationary as the dish turns. The dish should also be tiltable about a perpendicular axis, in order to follow the sun's seasonal north-south movements.
