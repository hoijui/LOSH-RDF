function = "The paraboloid is an interesting shape with some amazing qualities. It has the power to concentrate light, electronic waves, sound, etc. to its focus at the center. To find the focal point of a paraboloid, one must use the formula, [math]\\displaystyle{ y=p*x^2 }[/math], where p is a constant. The variable y is the depth of the dish, and x measures the distance from the center axis to the maximum circumference of the dish."
