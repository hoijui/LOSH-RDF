function = "Al \"Bokashiman\" from a guerilla gardening group led a seedball-making workshop. It is satisfying to get your hands muddy and spend a couple hours in a zen-like trance rolling seedballs - it's highly recommended!   == Here's the recipe == 5 parts dry red clay 3 parts dry organic compost 1 part seed 1 â€“ 2 parts water We used a 16oz. plastic cup as a measure, which made enough for approximately 300 seedballs. After mixing together all the dry ingredients, we added enough water to form a mix that held together without crumbling but wasn't so wet that it wouldn't roll into balls.\nmeditation, gardening"
