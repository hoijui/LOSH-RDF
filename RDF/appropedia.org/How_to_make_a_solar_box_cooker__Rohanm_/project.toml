function = "The primary goal of this Appropriate Technology project is to consolidate existing information on solar cooking, as well as evaluate materials and design techniques utilized for the construction of widely used solar box cooker models. Although hundreds of innovative solar cooker designs have been invented including the popular parabolic and panel cookers, the solar box cooker is given the widest consideration due to its widespread global usage, particularly in the developing world. See The solar cooking archive wiki for exhaustive details   = Introduction =   == Developmental Need == Cooking in developing countries is customarily done on open fires using biomass such as firewood, charcoal, and kerosene. This process inevitably leads to excessive deforestation in these rural regions as well as considerably increase CO2 emissions. Individuals in these developing regions also suffer from respiratory infections due to significant smoke inhalation."
