function = "Stadium light reflector hoods function as solar cookers and drinking water pasteurizers. When aimed at the sun the parabolic reflector works in reverse, by focusing concentrated sunlight to a black pot set approximately where the light bulb normally is. The reflectors are readily found in industrialized societies, in cities that have athletic stadiums. The lighting systems are replaced about once every 15 to 20 years and the reflectors can be obtained by contacting the managers of the sports stadiums and by checking at local recycling centers and metal scrap yards. The reflectors hoods are ready to function as parabolic solar cookers without significant modification."
