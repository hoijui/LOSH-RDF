    okh:function "Three students, Tony, Tyler, Devan, and their mentor Bart , as a school project for Humboldt State University, collaborated to design and build a hot air popcorn maker powered only by the sun. Using a heat exchanger constructed by a previous engineering student, a parabolic solar cooking dish, a fan, and a, solar panel and various recycled materials from scrap piles we created a near working device. Although we never made a full batch of popcorn, we did achieve hot enough temperatures (about 300i F within the heat exchanger) that we later found had popped the kernels we placed in there to see if they would pop   == Introduction == This project was for a school group project for the ENG 114 class taught at Humboldt State University by Lonny Grafman. Many neat projects were done by other groups as well such as the solar cooker for CCAT, The thermal curtains CCAT thermal curtains howto, and an earth ship wall.   == Project Requirements == The project began with 4 components already assembled and ready to use:  A rusty steal heat exchanger designed by a previous engineering student, A parabolic satellite dish converted into a solar cooker, A 12v D.C. fan and a solar panel to power the fan." ;
