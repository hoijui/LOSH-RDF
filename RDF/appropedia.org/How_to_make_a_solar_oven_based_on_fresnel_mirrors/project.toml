function = "Fresnel mirrors is a technology to concentrate light on a focus point. Then the concentrated rays of the sun can be used for different energy purposes. Lytefire is a solar oven freely inspired by Fresnel mirrors.   == Fresnel mirrors ==   === Technology === The technology of Fresnel mirrors is inspired from Fresnel lenses. \"The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design.\"   === Advantages === The first advantage is economical."
