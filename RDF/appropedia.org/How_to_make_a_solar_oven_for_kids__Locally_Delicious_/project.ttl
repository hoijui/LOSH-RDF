    okh:function "We were in Engr215 Introduction to Design and were working for Locally Delicious to design a solar oven that children ages 8-12 could build and use independently. This design took place at Humboldt State University in the United States. We were encouraged to \"think out of the solar box\" and create something more original than an aluminum foil covered shoe box. We wanted to get the children thinking about the food they eat and how they can be in control of their diet. After doing research on solar ovens, solar materials, the capabilities of children ages 8-12, and the transfer of heat, we came up with several alternative designs." ;
