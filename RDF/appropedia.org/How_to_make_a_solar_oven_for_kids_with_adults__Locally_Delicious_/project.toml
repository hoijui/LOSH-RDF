function = "Team Universal Research and Design's goal was to design a solar oven that kids, ages 8-12, could build with the help of an adult. We were commissioned by the group Locally Delicious to create this design for their forthcoming book, Lunchbox Envy. It is hoped that the design will encourage the kids to think about their energy consumption, and make them more aware of alternative, more sustainable methods of cooking.   == Background == Locally Delicious is a group of women who have strong beliefs in locally grown foods and sustainability. They also want to educate kids on healthy food options in order to ensure a healthier future."
