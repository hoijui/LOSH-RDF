function = "For my Alternative Energy Class Final Project at Sierra Nevada College I built a solar oven with the provision of Ben Solomon’s shop and tools, and taught a sustainability lesson to middle school class from The Tahoe Expedition Academy with Celia. My inspiration for sharing my project with the youth comes from a quote in our library, “What we have done for ourselves alone, dies with us; what we have done for others... remains and is immortal”.-- Albert Pike. The oven is great for my own household cooking needs, but the evolutionary aspect of my project to share sustainability with others, was the defining moment of my project’s completion. I will go over the innovation, the investigation, the investment, and conclude with the implementation of my solar oven project."
