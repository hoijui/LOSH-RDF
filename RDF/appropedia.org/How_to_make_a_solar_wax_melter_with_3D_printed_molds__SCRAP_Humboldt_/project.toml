function = "Solar Wax Melter with 3D Printed Molds utilizes 3-D printing capabilities and the energy produced from the Sun to heat and re-purpose crayons, candles, and other waxes. The Solar Wax Melter is constructed out of common waste stream items and up-cycles them into a useful and interesting design whose main function is further up-cycling. This design was created in the Humboldt State University Engineering 215, for the client, SCRAP Humboldt whose goal is to \"inspire creative reuse and environmentally sustainable behavior by providing educational programs and affordable materials to the community.\"    == Background ==  Engineering 215 is a design class at Humboldt State University that, each semester, partners with a local community business to improve student experience and to improve the business partner. For the 2013 Spring Semester, Engineering 215 has partnered with SCRAP Humboldt, a non-profit organization that promotes creative reuse and up-cycling. Team SuperStar's (pictured right) goal, and challenge, was to design a 3-D printed object that would add value to the waste stream."
