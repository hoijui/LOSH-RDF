The upkeep of this system is straightforward. There are links provided to help troubleshoot and learn more about making your own compost   == Background == In this household there are 2 people who cummulate a fair amount of green waste and yard trimmings along with food scraps from the kitchen. One major concern was deer being able to access the bin, and a want was for quick compost turnover with ease."
