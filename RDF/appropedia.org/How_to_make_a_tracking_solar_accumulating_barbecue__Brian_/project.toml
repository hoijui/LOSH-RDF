function = "This page describes an apparatus to automatically rotate a solar reflector so it tracks the sun as it moves across the sky during the day. The concept of the tracking barbecue is fairly simple. A parabolic dish is set up on equatorial mount with the focus on the axis it turns on. If you point the dish at the sun and then turn the axis at 15 degrees per hour then the focus remains on the same spot all day. The turning can be done with a telescope tracking motor for equatorial mount."
