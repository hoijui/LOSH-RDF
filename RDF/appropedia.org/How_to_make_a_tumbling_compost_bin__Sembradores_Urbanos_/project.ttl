    okh:function "Compost can help improve your soil, increase water infiltration, reduce erosion, recycle kitchen and yard waste, and grow healthier plants. In urban environments clean uncontaminated soil is not always available, composting can be used as a way to create soil and has also been found as a way to bioremediate contaminated soils. This composting project is a demonstration by Sembradores Urbanos of creating clean and fertile soil out of food and yard waste. This is one project in a series of urban gardening projects at Sembradores Urbanos.   == Background ==  At the same time that our agricultural soils are being contaminated and built upon with suburban sprawl, we are throwing away precious nutrient resources that could be used to restore contaminated soils." ;
