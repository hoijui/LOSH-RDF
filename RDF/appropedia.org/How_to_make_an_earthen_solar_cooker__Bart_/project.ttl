    okh:function "The Earthen Solar Cooker is a durable, low cost and low environmental impact design envisioned by Bart Orlando [1] for use by the poor in refugee camps and in villages of non-industrialized nations. The design is simple; a large parabolicly shaped hole in the ground lined with reflective steel drum lids. As part of a food aid program to prevent stunting of malnourished children, pallets of 55 gallon stainless steel drums containing vegetables would be airlifted to remote refugee camps and villages. The drum lids (covers) would be specially designed to be smooth, mirror finished stainless steel surfaces which could then be used as reflectors and food serving platters. Steel drum lids are sometimes stamped with a slight parabolic curvature to strengthen them." ;
