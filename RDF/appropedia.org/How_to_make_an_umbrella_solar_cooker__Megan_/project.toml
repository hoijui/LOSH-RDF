function = "The use of a parabolic shape is not a new invention by any means. There has been used throughout the history of focusing the sun's rays for cooking purposes. Today, many are attracted to the idea of cooking with a renewable resource instead of using expensive and pollutant fuels. Furthermore, I am hopeful that with the use of parabolic solar cookers, third world countries can decrease mortality that is attributed to contaminated water. This is what I look forward to as I begin my project building a solar cooker.\ncooking"
