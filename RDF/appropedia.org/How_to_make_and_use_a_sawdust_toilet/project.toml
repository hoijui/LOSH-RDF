function = "My version of a \"sawdust toilet\" (as described in the Humanure Handbook) consists of a receptacle bucket, a removable toilet seat that slips into the top, and a bucket of sawdust for covering after each use. When the toilet is full the seat is switched to the empty sawdust bucket. The toilet is emptied, cleaned and sanitized and then becomes the sawdust bucket after filling with clean sawdust. The whole toilet system, including outdoor compost chamber, can be constructed for less than $10. This simple, inexpensive, and hygienic toilet -- affordable to construct and maintain by just about anyone on the planet -- is a perfect example of an appropriate and sustainable technology."
