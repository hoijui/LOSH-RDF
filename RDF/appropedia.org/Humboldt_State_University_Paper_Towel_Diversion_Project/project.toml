function = "Humboldt State University is striving to meet its sustainability goals through a series of campus wide projects. One of these goals is to reduce the amount of waste the campus generates. Currently a food waste diversion pilot study is being conducted in conjunction with the Humboldt Waste Management Authority (HWMA) to estimate feedstock for a proposed municipal anaerobic digester. This page outlines a current student project looking into the possibility of including bathroom paper towels to the food waste. A pilot study was conducted to determine: mass and volume of paper towels generated, behavior change through participation in project, and logistics for future study."
