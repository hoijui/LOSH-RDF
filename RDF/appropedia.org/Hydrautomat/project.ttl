    okh:function "The Hydrautomat is a self-powered water pump that uses both air and water pressure to lift water up a series of open and closed tanks by means of both vacuum and pressure. The Hydrautomat was invented by Thomas Gaskell Allen in the 1920's, and was hailed as 'One of the world's greatest engineering devices', and even garnering praise from the famous physicist Sir Oliver Lodge, who said of the device \"I can only express my admiration of the simplicity and beauty of the invention, and my wonder that humanity has had to wait so long for the construction of an arrangement which must prove of the greatest service.\" The Hydrautomat was about 7.5 feet high and could lift water 20 feet, and could pump as much as 70,000 gallons of water per day. I am Michael Sipos (aka BlueJersey112/Blue112) and I approve of the redistribution of any of my Hydrautomat photos on this page. April 26, 2014.   == Operation ==   The Hydrautomat works by feeding water from the River Bed (B) into the bottom of the Operating Chamber through the Inlet Water Pipe (G), which then pressurizes the air inside the Operating Chamber, and subsequently pressurizes the two Closed Containers (C) that are connected to the top of the Operating Chamber by an Air Pipe (F)." ;
