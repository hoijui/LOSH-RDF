    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Early detection of preeclampsia is key so as to prevent eclampsia, a high blood pressure disorder and the second-leading cause of maternal deaths in the developing world. However, early detection is a rarity in developing countries because of the lack of affordable hypertension detectors and also because unskilled health workers find it difficult to operate and read conventional devices. Thus, there is a need for simple detection of hypertension for mothers in low-resource settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == Jhpiego, a non-profit international health organization affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, has developed a durable, easy-to-use, and affordable detector containing a mechanical crank that produces either a green or red light to signal hypertension. The device utilizes oscillometry to detect blood pressure." ;
