    okh:function "This project consists on the design and elaboration of a device that can plot an I-V graph to show the I-V relationship of silicon PV panels as an efficiency indicator. Data must be recorded and transmitted to a data base on a computer through the USB port. The device must also be able to interrupt the panel load in order to measure current and voltage values, under different levels of sun irradiation. The device is made of low cost materials that allows low budget research to be conducted.   == Overview == The measures of current and voltage from the PV taken by the device to plot the curve, must be recorded and transmitted to a data base on a computer through wireless means." ;
