function = "== Problem being addressed == Prosthetic devices are difficult to come by in developing countries because of the cost, fitting procedures, and rough conditions of low-resource settings. Disabilities carry a larger burden for those in developing countries because disabled individuals are rendered immobile, unable to work, and may be considered burdensome to their already socioeconomically constrained families.   == Detailed description of the solution == The OpenSocket prosthetic arm offers an inexpensive and effective prosthetic option for below-elbow amputees in developing country settings because it is highly-functional, robust, and easily fit to new patients. Prosthetic arms can be removed from the shelf and fitted to individuals within minutes. Furthermore, arms can be easily manufactured in various sizes and have adjustable lengths, diameters, and contours so that amputees can adjust it themselves."
