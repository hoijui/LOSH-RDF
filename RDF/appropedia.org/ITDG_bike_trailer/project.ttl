Where motor vehicles are not available, a sturdy bicycle trailer will enable traders and farmers to move goods, machinery, tools and materials further and faster than they could ever be carried on foot. Fetching water is another critical use, rather than carrying it or using a wheelbarrow, leading to saved time and cleaner / healthier living. We set out to design a robust, low cost, simple trailer made from globally available materials and unwanted bicycle parts." ;
