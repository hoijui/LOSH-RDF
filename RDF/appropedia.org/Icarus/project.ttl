    okh:function "The Icarus project is a multi-disciplinary project working on an absorption power system for highly efficient power generation from low temperature industrial waste heat. The goal is to create innovative and environmentally friendly CO2/lubricant absorption technology for power generation from low temperature industrial waste heat to reduce emissions and costs. The main target group for ICARUS technology is in the lime and cement industries who need this technology to improve efficiency and lower emissions in the industry.   == Project goals == Create an absorption power generation technology for low temperature (60-120C) heat Create a waste-heat power generation system for industrial (chemical, cement) applications that can achieve an efficiency of up to 20% for electricity to be generated from industrial waste heat (<120C) without affecting industrial processes. Offer improved environmental performance and improved efficiency Reduced CO2 emissions at a cost that is affordable to the end-user." ;
