Located in the Middle Atlas Mountains, the village of Amzrai in Zawiya Ahansal, Morocco benefits most from the project that is to be completed by the Fall 2010.   == Background == Kristoffer Erickson and Cloe Medina Erickson completed their first project in the Middle Atlas Mountains in the village of Taghia in 2006. The project involved the improvement of a school and trails in the area in partnership with The North Face Athletes and RushHDTV. The success of the project led to the expansion of the partnership's work at request of the surrounding communities. The Igherm Restoration and Regional Library project was established."
