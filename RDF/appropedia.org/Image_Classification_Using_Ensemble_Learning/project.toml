function = "Introduction of ensemble learning by using LFW data set.   == Project Goal == The program will receive two pictures from people's face and should be able to determine if they belong to one person or not.    == Dataset == Intoduction: a database of face photographs designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition. The data set contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured."
