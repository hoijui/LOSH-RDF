function = "== Problem being addressed == Vaccination distribution and tracking are serious problems in the developing world, especially in remote areas. Medical records can be carried by patients on paper or not kept at all, leading to inefficiencies in identifying children most in need of vaccination and children who have already been vaccinated.   == Detailed description of the solution == The ImmuNet system will be capable of determining a personâ€™s immune status , updating vaccination records in an underlying database, and providing fast, targeted dissemination of vaccination availability in rural areas. ImmuNet correlates up-to-date vaccine status of all persons in a coverage area with family relationship and biometric data and tracks human behavior to aid in rapid, prioritized immunization of infants and children. It is intended for areas without cellular connectivity because it gives residents of these areas a cellular network to use for vaccination information."
