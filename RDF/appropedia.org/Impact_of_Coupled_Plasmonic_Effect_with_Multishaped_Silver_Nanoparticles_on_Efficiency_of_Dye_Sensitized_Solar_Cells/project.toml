function = "Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have numerous advantages, but in order to use widespread industrial deployment we need to boost the power conversion efficiency. One promising approach to improve DSSC performance is to improve the spectral response of sensitizers with metal nanoparticle-based surface plasmon resonance. Even single shaped nanoparticles (NPs), however, have physical limitations. Thus, in this study a simple synthesis route is used to fabricate multishaped silver (Ag) NPs to create a coupled plasmonic effect in DSSC to cover more of the solar spectrum. The impact of multishaped AgNPs combinations are studied to determine which aspects improve the power conversion efficiency of DSSC. A detailed investigation was made of both the TiO2 (XRD) and AgNPs (UV-Vis spectrometry) to couple the impacts on the DSSC (I-V) with the combination of the morphologies (TEM and FESEM) of AgNPs."
