function = "This is an improvement of a previous hammer design, which can be found here  For the purpose of being an open source appropriate technology, I have identified a few areas the concept of a 3D printable hammer can be improved. The most obvious issue with the previous design in regards to appropriate technology, is wasted material. In the realm of appropriate technology, saving material and ultimately money wherever possible is a must, excess material is going to increase cost for no real gains. The previously designed hammer has some aesthetic shaping to it that does not do anything functionally for the purpose of using it as a hammer, and as such I have removed this from my design. Additionally, the existing design is not optimally designed for 3D printing."
