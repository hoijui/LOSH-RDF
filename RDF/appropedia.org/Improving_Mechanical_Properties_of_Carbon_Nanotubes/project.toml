function = "Carbon nanotubesW (CNT) have been placed at the forefront of materials technology since their discovery in the early 1990s. Extensive research has been conducted on them for just under two decades, revealing many desirable and unique mechanical, electrical, optical and electron transport properties. One of the areas that can still be greatly improved is the practical strength and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes. For example the theoretical value of the tensile strength of CNTs is estimated to be between 140GPa to 177GPa. However due to defects in the material, only practical values of up to 63GPa have been achieved."
