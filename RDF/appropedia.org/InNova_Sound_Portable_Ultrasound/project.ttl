    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Ultrasound imaging has proven crucial in antenatal and prenatal screenings however, women in low-resource settings often do not have access to such services due to financial strains and the fact that conventional ultrasound systems cannot be easily transported. As a result, preventable complications often go undetected. Thus, there is a need for cost-effective, portable, and efficient antenatal/prenatal screening services in developing nations.   == Detailed description of the solution == InNova Sound is an inexpensive portable ultrasound imaging system that is contained within a handheld probe that plugs into USB 2.0 ports of computers running Windows XP, Vista, or MAC operating systems. The device makes ultrasound available in nontraditional settings, bringing these services to those who need it the most." ;
