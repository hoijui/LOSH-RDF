    okh:function "My project was to create my own Indoor garden which can be grown indoor during winter months. Once garden is fully grown, it can be hung up. displaying vertically allows space conservation within your home. Indoor gardening has become a efficient way to supply food, clean air, and recycling water waste. Over the past ten years indoor and vertical gardening has become extremely important to urban communities as well." ;
