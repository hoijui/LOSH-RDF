    okh:function "In order to alleviate production costs and increase the environmental performance of solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing, an eco-industrial park for GW-scale production of PV is proposed. This article quantifies the inputs and outputs for the glass manufacturing component of such a system using standard manufacturing techniques. Utilizing industrial symbiosis in this way, potential reductions for such a plant were found to be about 30,000 tons/year in raw materials and over 220,000 GJ/year in embodied energy.  Schematic diagram of Industrial symbiosis in photovoltaic manufacturing. The highlighted red area is the industries studied in this project." ;
