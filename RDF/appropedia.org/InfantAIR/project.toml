function = "== Problem being addressed == Respiratory distress from acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of infant and child death in the developing world. Oxygen therapy is an effective treatment, but the expensive cost often prohibits treatment in resource-limited settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == A simple, rugged bubbling continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) provides pressurized oxygen therapy to children suffering respiratory distress at a fraction of the cost of other commercial bCPAP devices. InfantAIR reduces severe adverse consequences of respiratory infection and allows for inexpensive and infrequent maintenance.   == Designed by == Designed by: This device was developed at Rice University's Beyond Traditional Borders program."
