function = "Proper growth of infants and young children is paramount to the development of well-functioning adults. Hospitals in developing countries lack the funding for all proper medical instruments and equipment - one-third of of these hospitals even lack the access to running water. Infantometers can be used to measure the height of infants and small children to gauge the physical growth during the early stages of life. Although infantometers are composed of only several parts, they can be quite costly. This page will discuss how to produce a cost-effective infantometer through access to 3-D printing and minimal external materials.\nheight measuring"
