    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Air is a major source of transmission for TB and other healthcare associated infections. The Inov8 Air Disinfection Unit is designed to rapidly mitigate the spread of healthcare associated infections by filtering air within an enclosed space to kill air borne bacteria, viruses, and fungi to almost undetectable levels.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Inov8 Air Disinfection Unit is a portable device that uses hydroxyl radicals to recreate the natural germ-killing properties of fresh air. This product requires a refill cartridge that contains limonene, which is a byproduct of orange juice. Hydroxyl radicals deactivate bacteria and viruses such as tuberculosis." ;
