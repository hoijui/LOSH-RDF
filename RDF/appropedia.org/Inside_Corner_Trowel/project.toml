function = "When money is hard to come by and other tools take priority, a tool that makes a corner at a 90 degree angle is usually not high on the list of equipment to buy. I wanted to make a relatively cheap tool that can do this. Normally a tool like this can go from anywhere between $10-20 but since it has a relatively small window of use, it is not often purchased. This project was designed for people that cannot afford a more expensive version of this tool as printing this in PLA is approx. $2.00   == Bill of Materials == Total two parts made in OpenSCAD. Total ~150 grams of filament Cornering Tool Handle All files posted at : | Youmagine Link   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == None, just connect the two pieces together as shown in the picture."
