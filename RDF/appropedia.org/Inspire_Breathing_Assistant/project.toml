function = "== Problem being addressed == Pneumonia is a major cause of death for infants and children in resource-limited settings. Since oxygen therapy is expensive and requires medical professionals, antibiotics are the often the only treatment.   == Detailed description of the solution == Inspire converts room air into pressurized gas to expand patientsâ€™ lung instead of using oxygen tanks like traditional bubble CPAP methods. Doctors can direct oxygen into the Inspire device if oxygen supplements are necessary. Since pure oxygen in excess doses can result in blindness and asthma, this device is also safer for less-trained professionals to use."
