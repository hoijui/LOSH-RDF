    okh:function "This is an implementation of using a photoelectric smoke detector to trigger the reset pin on the Beaglebone Black Rev C being used on the MOST Athena Delta 3D Printer. The purpose of this design is to prevent and minimize printer damage, overheating, temperature runoff, and fire risk when a 3D printer is running unattended.   == Materials & Tools Needed == Photoelectric Smoke Alarm of any kind, such as the one here (not the model pictured in this tutorial) -- SCAD models made for one with a 12\" mounting disk, but can be modified for other types 5 M3 Screws of 15 mm length 5 M3 nuts 18 Gauge wire - roughly 3.5 - 4 feet total 9 Volt Battery Soldering Iron Flathead Screwdriver Superglue   == Items to 3D Print == Smoke Alarm mount Arms -- Smoke Alarm Mount Arms Smoke Alarm Mount Disk -- Smoke Alarm Mount Disk   == Instructions == Print off 3 Arms and one Base Fixture; set models to a scale of 10 in your slicer.  Use M3 bolts to mount arms to fixture in the insets of the fixture, shown in Figure 1. use nuts to hold in place." ;
