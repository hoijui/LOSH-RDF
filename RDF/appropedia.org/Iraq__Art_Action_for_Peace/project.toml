function = "Sice the 2003 American led invasion of Iraq, the country has been torn by civil war, \"sectarian cleansing\", a massive refugee crisis, and a surge in violence against women. With the help of oraganizations like MADRE and OWFI, many of the nations youth, Sunni and Shia alike, have rallied together through art, music, and poetry to promote peace.   === MADRE === MADRE is an international organization that works together with other community based organizations to promote a wide variety of human rights including women's rights, health, and education. It began in 1983 when a group of women travelled to Nicaragua after the US led Contra war. Kathy Engel, MADRE's founding director, envisioned a completely women run human rights organization."
