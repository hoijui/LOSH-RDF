function = "== Problem being addressed == Each year, about 25 million infants in resource-limited settings do not receive necessary vaccinations. 2.4 million of those infants die from diseases that could have been prevented by proper vaccinations. The lack of child identification technology and medical records in low resource settings severely limits the ability for these areas to identify children that need to receive vaccines.   == Detailed description of the solution == The National University of Singapore developed a biometric identification algorithm that can be loaded on to any typical cell phone. It recognizes each childâ€™s iris and stores this as identification in a database."
