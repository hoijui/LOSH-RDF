    okh:function "Sanitary medical devices are critical in healthcare. These locking forceps (also known as a hemostat) are considered an appropriate technology because they provide a basic human need, sanitary medical instruments. Many third world countries are lacking basic healthcare infrastructure; these hemostats can help provide a sanitary tool if the bed is disinfected before printing and handled with gloves after printing and during assembly. Once the locking forceps have been used, the old tips can be discarded and new tips can be installed. Additionally, specialized tips can be printed such as towel clamps." ;
