    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == There are tens of thousands of amputees living in the developing world. Unfortunately, patients that live in these resource-poor areas and who lose a knee joint have few options. A titanium replacement can cost up to $10,000 and other inexpensive models are too crude to work effectively.   == Detailed description of the solution == The JaipurKnee is flexible and stable, even on irregular terrain. It is comprised of five pieces of plastic, four nuts and bolts and has self-lubricating, oil-filled nylon." ;
