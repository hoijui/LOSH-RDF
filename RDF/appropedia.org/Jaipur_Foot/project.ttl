    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Quality of life is dependent on an individual's ability to perform his/her daily tasks. Moreover, in developing countries, many professions are highly dependent on physical activities. Of course, these regions are the most affected ones by phenomena that hinder their physical performance, such as traffic accidents, wars, and natural disasters. Therefore, a low-cost, easy to manufacture and to implement technology that can help people with disabilities has a large impact on the quality of lives of millions globally. Prosthetics in this venue are among the most targeted and tried technologies that can help improve the lives of millions." ;
