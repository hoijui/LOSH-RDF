function = "== Water Scarcity == Water makes up 75% of the Earthâ€™s surface. Ninety-seven percent of this waster is in oceans, which is saltwater. This leaves only 3% of fresh water that is fit for human consumption, which are found in groundwater, rivers, and lakes. Less than 1% is actually within human reach. This means that available freshwater resources are limited and being increasingly depleted at fast rates."
