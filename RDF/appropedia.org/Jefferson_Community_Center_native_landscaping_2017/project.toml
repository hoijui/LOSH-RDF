function = "In this project, which takes places during Spring of 2017, a small strip of land outside Jefferson Community Center in Eureka, California was re-designed so it wasn't a swampy mess that was a problem for the community center. Humboldt State University Appropriate Technology students Richard Moog and Kathrine Sanguinetti designed a landscape to improve the site, which was saturated with water due to onsite rainwater collection. The design includes a dry stream bed that facilitates water drainage and also includes berms that raise the plants above the water table for better water drainage. Members at Native Plant Society and Lost Foods in Eureka helped develop a list of plants that could be used for the project and gave tips on their needs. Over the course of five three-hour-workdays, Appropriate Technology class members as well as volunteers in the community and at HSU helped to landscape and plant the garden, as well as develop educational brochure and signage to educate the community on the native plants chosen for the project."
