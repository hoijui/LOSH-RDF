    okh:function "The Westside Community Improvement Association is a grass-roots organization in Eureka, California working to revitalize the local urban neighborhood by restoring the Jefferson School site. Last April, they won the bid to purchase the site which they are working towards turning into a community center and charter school. One of their first tasks was to reopen the playground for local children who had nowhere else to play. For this project, community members will collaborate to facilitate a sustainability teach-in where low-to-no cost technologies can be shared and implemented within a diverse community.   == Problem statement == The objective of this project is to integrate what the community wants to learn about appropriate technology into a cohesive workshop, and then to advertise and facilitate said workshop." ;
