function = "== Problem being addressed == Nursing mothers who are HIV positive can spread HIV to infants through their breast milk. There has been an effort to prevent the transmission from infected mothers to their babies.   == Detailed description of the solution == The JustMilk Nipple Shield is placed on the nipple of the breast and fills the surface of the insert with a low-cost anti-viral agent. The anti-viral agent is released into the milk during breast-feeding. A technical challenge is ensuring that the anti-viral agent, which is desorbed under specific flow conditions, is loaded onto the surface of the insert at a rate such that an adequate dose can be delivered to the child."
