function = "== Problem being addressed == Contaminated water sources are often the cause for diarrheal diseases. Inhabitants in low-resource settings often lack ready access to clean water and are most susceptible to diseases caused by contaminated water. In addition, water supplies can be contaminated with high levels of arsenic. For example, in eastern Nepal, 9% of the 268 water samples contained arsenic above the WHO guidelines.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Arsenic Bio-sand Filter (ABF) removes arsenic, iron, and bacterial contamination without using any chemicals."
