function = "== Problem being addressed == Postpartum hemorrhaging is one of the most severe causes of maternal mortality. PPH (Postpartum hemorrhaging) rates in the developed worlds have severely decreased, but they are still a great threat in developing countries. The World Health Organization suggests that there are over 100,000 deaths due to postpartum hemorrhaging every year.   == Detailed description of the solution == Kanga, a type of fabric made of cotton commonly used by African women, is rectangular (100cm Ã— 155 cm) in shape. Two pieces of kanga (with a mentioned size) soaked in blood estimate the threshold for blood loss more than 500 ml."
