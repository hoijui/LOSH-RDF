function = "I developed a household size composting system with a rotating 3-lid design, in Humboldt County, California. I wanted a system that would be easy to use and implement in a standard home, for an affordable price. Before this project, my household did not have a compost system set up, so I was able to start from scratch. The design I decided to go with is a small scale version of a design my appropriate technology group and I developed for The Community Center of Appropriate Technology (CCAT) at Cal Poly Humboldt in Arcata, CA. You can see this project here CCAT compost system 2020. On this page you should find all the necessities, from cost & supplies to maintenance & operation, to implement this system in your own home."
