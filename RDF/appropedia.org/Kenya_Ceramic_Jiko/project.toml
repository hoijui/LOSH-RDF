function = "Kenya Ceramic Jinko, an improved cooking stove for Africa.   == Background == Traditional cooking methods in central Africa used a ceramic pot on an open fire or brick fireplace. With the introduction of iron, metal cooking pots came into use (Figure 1). This was usually supported on stones or clay bricks, with a wood fire burning underneath. With the flux of traders and colonists from Europe, surplus metal drums (oil, petrol) became available."
