The Hot Press allows the user to produce a value-added composite tile out of waste plastic and fiber (most commonly cardboard and paper). Currently three prototypes have been built, one at Queen's, one at RISD, and one at CEP. Detailed design drawings are available at the WFL website.   = Problem Definition and Scope = The WFL team has identified several key areas of design development that they would like to pursue:  Dimensions - The current Kingston Hot Press can produce a 24\"x24\"x1/4\" sheet. A wider gap in the press could allow more width and perhaps allow for 3D molds."
