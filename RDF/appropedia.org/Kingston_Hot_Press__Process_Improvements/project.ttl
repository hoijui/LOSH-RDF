    okh:function "Check out the project on wasteforlife.org Hot Press Discussion Page The organization Waste for Life (WFL) defines itself as \"a loosely joined network of scientists, engineers, educators, architects, artists, designers, and cooperatives who work together to develop poverty-reducing solutions to specific ecological problems.\" Through a collaboration with researchers and community members at Queen's University, the Centro Experimental de la Produccion (CEP) in Argentina, the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), Smith College, and the University of Western Australia, the Kingston Hot Press has been designed and developed to provide the means of production to smaller cooperatives in communities in Argentina and Lesotho. The Hot Press allows the user to produce a value-added composite tile out of waste plastic and fiber (most commonly cardboard and paper). Currently three prototypes have been built, one at Queen's, one at RISD, and one at CEP. Detailed design drawings are available at the WFL website.   = Problem Definition and Scope = The WFL team has identified several key areas of design development that they would like to pursue:  Dimensions - The current Kingston Hot Press can produce a 24\"x24\"x1/4\" sheet. A wider gap in the press could allow more width and perhaps allow for 3D molds." ;
