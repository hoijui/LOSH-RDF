    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Over 3 million people die of diarrheal diseases each year. In the case of developing countries, a large portion of illnesses could be prevented if more people had access to water for hand washing, which is hard to find. Also when traveling, it is hard to find access to clean water far from a fresh source.   == Detailed description of the solution == The device uses a micro-filter to filter out contaminants larger than a micrometer and a piezoelectric powered electrolysis device to filter between 5 and 20mL of water at a time. It removes 99.99% of all parasites." ;
