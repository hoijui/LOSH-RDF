    okh:function "High school shop teachers are on a tighter budget now than ever, and the trades are in higher demand today in local high schools. In wood shop, a lot of tools can cost a lot of money, even the smaller tools. One of these small tools that costs over 20 dollars is a Kreg Pocket Hole Jig. These jigs are used to make holes to join together pieces of wood in products such as tables, clocks, nightstands, or any fine finished wood product. With different sizes of wood and different hardware needed, these jigs can get up into the hundreds of dollars to have multiple jigs in multiple sizes, which is why the code is customizable up to .75 inch drill bits." ;
