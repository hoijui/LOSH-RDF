function = "In this page, an open-source LIBS-core scanner is described. LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) is a form of atomic emission spectroscopy where a low energy but high power density laser pulse is used to ablate a small amount of material and turn it into plasma. When cooling down, the excess energy is emitted as photons with discrete energy states. From this light the elemental composition of the sample can be determined.  All the .scad and .stl files will be shared as soon as they are printed and tested."
