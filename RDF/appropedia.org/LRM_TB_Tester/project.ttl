    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == The accurate and timely detection of tuberculosis (TB) is critical in limiting the spread of the disease. As such, new methods are under development that are fast, accurate, inexpensive, and portable, meeting the needs of resource-limited environments where the disease is most prevalent.   == Detailed description of the solution == The device utilizes luciferase reporter mycobacteriophages (LRM), which are assays that emit light when they interact with live TB bacteria in a sample of saliva/sputum. The project is centered on developing a versatile luminescence detection tool to capture and interpret the emitted light. The test can provide results within a day, compared to at least one week for most traditional methods." ;
