The school was facing pressure to increase its size due to limited space and high enrollment. By building a new room at the school we could both increase the amount of space and explore the effectiveness of alternative building techniques.   ==== Problem ==== The goal of this project was to explore cost-effective, environmentally appropriate alternatives to traditional building methods in the Dominican Republic while creating additional space for the Escuela Basica Nurys Zarzuela.   ==== Criteria and Constraints ==== The following criteria were decided upon for this project."
