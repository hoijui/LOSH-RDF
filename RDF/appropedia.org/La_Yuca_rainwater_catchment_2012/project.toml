function = "The Humboldt State University Dominicana Program, for the summer of 2012, has partnered with Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE), RevArk, and community members of La Yuca to improve the rainwater catchment system that was built during the 2011 Humboldt State Dominicana Program. The program takes place in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The rainwater catchment system of 2011 is frequently used in La Yuca to provide water for cleaning, but the system had problems producing drinkable water. A group of 6 people worked on improving the La Yuca rainwater catchment system from 2011. This group consisted of Katy Castillo, Cheyenne Celada, Rosa Anali Guzman Molina, Erinn Parrish, Jesse Shrader, and Estaban Wick."
