function = "The Practivistas Domincana Program is currently a program involving Humboldt State University and UNIBE that takes place in Santo Domingo, Domincan Republic. The rainwater catchment system in La Yuca in Santo Domingo was first constructed in 2011. The water from this system was used for washing but was not potable. In 2012 the system was reconstructed and had different filters added in order to make the water potable. In the beginning of the summer of 2013, the water is still being used for washing but the water available for drinking is not being filtered, and therefore, it is not being used."
