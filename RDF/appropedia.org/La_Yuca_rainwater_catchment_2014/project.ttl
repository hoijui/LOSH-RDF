    okh:function "Our objective for the water project for the 2014 Practivistas Dominicana Program in La Yuca is to replace the flat piping system, used to catch rainwater runoff from the roof, with a gutter that will obtain more water. Our project consisted of analyzing and restoring the existing rainwater catchment system located at La Yuca's school. After repairs were completed, our group expanded the existing system and developed an easily accessible rainwater catchment system that captures, filters, and distributes water that can be used by the local community. It is our goal that available rainwater can be captured efficiently and filtered sufficiently to be used for faucet and toilet purposes, thus providing the community with a cost effective solution to their water shortage.   == Background == This appropriate technology project is located in Dominican Republic in the La Yuca neighborhood of Santo Domingo." ;
