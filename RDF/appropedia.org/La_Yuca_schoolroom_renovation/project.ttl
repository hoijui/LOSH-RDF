    okh:function "In 2011 an ecoladrillo schoolroom was built as an additional room to Escuela Basica Nurys Zarzuela in La Yuca, del Naco, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Currently the room is only being used as a storage space, which is not the originally intended purpose. To be more suitable for other purposes the room needs a new wall plaster, an improved floor, and a better ventilation system that does not let in rainwater. The renewable energy systems also need to be fixed for the LED lights in the room to function.   == Objective == The objective is to fix the ecoladrillo schoolroom by adding a new plaster to the walls, fixing the floor, and fixing the ventilation of the room using natural building techniques." ;
