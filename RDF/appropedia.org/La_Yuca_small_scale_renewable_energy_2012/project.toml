function = "In the summer of 2012, Humboldt State University students returned to the Dominican Republic to improve the system to simplify the process of removing the system's rotating parts. With the help of UNIBE students and La Yuca community members, the wind turbine was upgraded to be more safe and efficient. In 2011, the Humboldt State University Dominicana Program partnered with Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE), RevArk, and La Yuca community members to start the La Yuca small scale renewable energy. The objective of this project was to light the classroom that was built in the same year. However, the renewable energy system was not easy to remove in case of an emergency and did not generate the desired amount of energy."
