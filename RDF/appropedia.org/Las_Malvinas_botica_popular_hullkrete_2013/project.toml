function = "This project was part of the Summer 2013 Practivistas Dominicana project, led by Lonny Grafman in the Dominican Republic. Five students, three from Humboldt State University (HSU) in California and two from Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) in Santo Domingo, collaborated with the community of Las Malvinas to construct three walls for a \"Botica Popular\" in the community. This experimented with cinder blocks, or concrete masonry units (CMUs) made of various upcycled materials such as sawdust, paper and rice hulls mixed with cement and pressed using an industrial cinder block maker. At the same time another team worked on building an internal wall out of ecoladrillo, or upcycled plastic bottles. Las Malvinas is a rural barrio on the Northern outskirts of Santo Domingo, next to the La Isabela industrial zone."
