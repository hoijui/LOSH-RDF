function = "The Practivistas Domincana Program is currently a study abroad program involving Humboldt State University and UNIBE that takes place in Santo Domingo, Domincan Republic. The rainwater catchment system in Las Malvinas in Santo Domingo was first constructed in 2011 by Intelegencia Colectivo from UNIBE. The water from this system was used for washing but was not potable.   == Objective == Vandalism and two years of wear and tear has caused the system to fail in its purpose to collect rainwater. The goal is to return the system to working condition and to improve on the previous design.   == Literature Review == Literature reviews from La Yuca rainwater catchment (2013) (2012) (2011) were utilized to understand and reconstruct the rainwater catchment system in Las Malvinas."
