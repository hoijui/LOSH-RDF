function = "Our project consisted of creating a new rainwater catchment system located at the pharmacy in Las Malvinas. Our group made the appropriate calculations and developed an easily accessible rainwater catchment system that captures, filters, and distributes water that can be used by the local community. It is our goal that available rainwater can be captured efficiently and filtered sufficiently to be used for a variety of other purposes, thus providing the community with a cost effective solution to their water shortage, with the cost of the materials listed below.   == Background == This appropriate technology project is located in the Dominican Republic in the Las Malvinas neighborhood of Santo Domingo. The team includes 3 students from Humboldt State University and 4 students from UNIBE and is taking place in the month of June, 2014."
