function = "Our job in Las Malvinas was to see if the local factory roof was a fitting place to put a rainwater catchment system for the community. We took dimensions of the area, made a design, calculated potential costs, and the payback that the system would have. It is possible that a future practivistas group could use this information to decide if a catchment system in this location would be feasible for future applications.   == Background == The location for the possible catchment system is in Las Malvinas, Dominican Republic. The 2014 Practivistas rainwater catchment team is partnering up with the local community to assess the feasibility of a rainwater catchment project in the future."
