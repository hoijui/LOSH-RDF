function = "Construction of a laser trip-wire to shut off a Delta printer in the event of a detached hotend nozzle or rod   == Laser Trip-wire shut-off for Delta Printer == Project developed by [[[User:Kev Man|Kev Man]] (talk) 17:27, 9 December 2015 (PST)]   == Abstract == Construction of a laser trip-wire to shut off a Delta printer (specifically MOST delta RepRap ) in the event of a detached hotend nozzle or rod which may happen as a result of :  Printing too fast Un-level print bed Hotend nozzel impact with a print ATENTION: You cannot use this method if you have taken up the BTemp digital pin on the Melzi board. This will not be an issue unless you have installed a heated print bed) This design requires the newest version of the Franklin firmware (as of Dec. 9, 2015).   == Materials Needed == Newest version of Franklin firmware (as of Dec. 9, 2015) Franklin firmware A laser light source: I used a BOSCH GTL2 laser level A photo resistor: 5mm GL5549 Photo Light Sensitive Resistor CDS 4 mirrors measuring 25mm wide by 44mm high, or other reflective surface (I used cut CD's) wires solder / soldering iron heat shrink tubing Drill with 3/16 bit   == Items to 3D Print == 4 Mirror Mounts *Mirror Mounts Photo resistor housing *Photo Resistor Housing   == Instructions == Upgrade your Delta RepRap printer with the current version of the Franklin firmware (see MOST delta RepRap for details Franklin install)."
