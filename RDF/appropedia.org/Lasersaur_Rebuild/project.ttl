    okh:function "LaserSaur laser cutter motion components redesign and custom firmware: Open Source Hardware Enterprise of Michigan Technological University purchased an open source laser cutter called the \"lasersaur\". While the design was adequate with testing we decided to attempt improvements on the motion components of the laser cutter.   == Reasons for the Rebuild ==  A substantial portion of the cutting bed could be re-claimed by redesigning the components increasing the working area of the laser cutter The prior designed linear motion system presented mechanics that were easy to mis-align. The movement of the gantry would cause the bearings to slightly loosen. This caused jittering in the cuts as seen below." ;
