function = "The Lonely Protons' goal for this project is to provide Laurel Tree Charter School with an energy monitoring system that shows energy consumption in a way that was both interesting and understandable to students of all ages.   == Introduction == The Lonely Protons is a group of two Humboldt State University Environmental Resources Engineering students in the Fall 2012 ENGR 215 design class. Our design project is to create a way for the students and faculty of Laurel Tree Charter School to be able to visually see their energy consumption at the school in a way that is understandable to students of all ages (K-12.) The solution decided upon by the Lonely Protons and Laurel Tree is to use a combination of arduinos and an intuitive optical colored display to express energy usage. Energy usage data will be obtained at the building source (breaker box) and sent to a micro-controller that will then use a color changing light source to illuminate a quartz crystal with colored light, thus indicating energy usage based on color.   == Problem Statement and Criteria == The students of Laurel Tree Charter School had no clear means of monitoring their electrical usage."
