The garden provides some salad greens for Laurel Tree Charter School's kitchen, while educating the primary age students about the importance of local agriculture. Applying the Montessori method of teaching, children will learn about gardening through hands on experience.   == Background == For the Fall 2012 ENGR 215 design class at Humboldt State University, students were assigned projects to promote sustainability and education at Laurel Tree Charter School. The Garden Gnomes is a team of four students tasked to implement a garden to kitchen system." ;
