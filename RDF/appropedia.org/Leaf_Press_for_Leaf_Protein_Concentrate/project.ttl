    okh:function "Leaf Protein Concentrate (LPC) is a protein rich substance similar to a curd or cottage cheese. LPC can be made from many varieties of leafs and can feed lots of people for a very low cost. In order to make LPC, the juice must be extracted from the leafs using a press. For more information on how to make LPC read the Skills and Knowledge section below.   == Bill of Materials == PLA Filament Leaf Press Base Leaf Press Lid   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == For more information on the process of creating LPC, visit the following link to a how-to video." ;
