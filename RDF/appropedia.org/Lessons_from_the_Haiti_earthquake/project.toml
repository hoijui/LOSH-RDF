function = "The Haiti earthquake of 2010 was a terrible tragedy, but offers lessons for those needing to understand crises and emergency management:  Everything I learned about how to react during an earthquake from growing up in California does not apply in developing countries. Forget standing in the doorway. Get outside and get outside fast. You can be in an impromptu IDP camp, your world can be turned upside down, but if your family is safe, you still can find happiness. Humanitarian responses are far more chaotic then you would ever believe and logisticians are totally underappreciated."
