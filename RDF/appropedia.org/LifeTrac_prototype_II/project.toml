function = "We have already built LifeTrac, the world's first, high performance, open source, multipurpose tractor. Our learnings from this project are:  Design-for-disassembly via bolt-together xyz beam design is feasible for building heavy equipment Initial results indicate that complete, life-size Erector Set or Lego Set for real technology can be built using stock steel and components Lifetime design, modularity, simplicity, and ease of maintenance are key features Initial results indicate that DIY kits - reconfiguarable from small tractors to bulldozers just like Lego Blocks - with interchangeable motors and power units - are a viable route to widespread adoption of the technology Cost performance in the DIY scenario appears to be a factor of 10 improvement over the competition Machine combines functionality of an agricultural tractor and a skid loader Material costs for LifeTrac I were $4k ($500 engine, $2000 hydraulics, $1000 frame,$500 balance of system including used 16\" wheels for $5 each)   = Performance Review = To date, LifeTrac I has undergone over 1 year of field testing. Bucket work, CEB press power, backhoeing, power generator work, bale spiking, tree hole augering, disking, rototilling, soil pulverizing, and other uses were performed. During initial testing, the articulated joint cracked in half and was redesigned completely. Since then, there have been no mechanical problems, such that down time never lasted more than a few minutes due to ready ability to repair."
