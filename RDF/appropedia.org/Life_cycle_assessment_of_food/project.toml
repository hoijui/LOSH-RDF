Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology provides an avenue of insight to global resource management strategies that are pertinent to the world today. With respect to the LCA of food, there are a multitude of facets comprising the whole. This review will address:  Indicators associated with food production impacts Mass flow of food Energy of food production Methods of quantifying impacts, including:  Carbon emissions Land use requirements Energy use   == LCA Definition as Applied to the Life Cycle of Food == The LCA methodology was designed to assess the environmental impacts associated with products, processes or activities. (Lundie and Peters, 2005) When the definition of the LCA is applied to the life cycle of food, each of the following life stages of a product are analyzed:  origin agricultural growing and production food processing, packaging and distribution preparation and consumption end of life The impacts considered to the system are biophysical in focus:  resource depletion energy consumption water and air pollution human health waste generation In order to further specify impacts, indicators are used to gage the degree and type of impact."
