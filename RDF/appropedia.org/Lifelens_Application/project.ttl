    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) are the main tools to diagnose malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, yet they are associated with a 60% incidence of false positives. This level of inaccuracy not only wastes valuable resources and money on patients who do not require these tests, but when uninfected individuals are treated for malaria, they also may develop resistance to artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACT). Lifelens offers a simple, more accurate, inexpensive, portable, and robust alternative for an effective malaria diagnosis in resource-constrained settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Lifelens application, supported by Windows Phone 7 software, uses proprietary computer vision algorithms to digitally analyze blood samples and detect malarial parasites. A high-resolution imaging sensor and a micro ball lens attachment provide 350x magnified three-dimensional models of cells in low-volume blood smears." ;
