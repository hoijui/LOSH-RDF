function = "Lightweight combination wrenches are simple enough to guarantee a usable print with at least one end of the wrench. The OpenSCAD script can easily be modified to generate custom sizes in metric and add additional features if the user wishes. These wrenches are easy to carry, relatively durable, and much cheaper than conventional options. They can be made with locally available materials in PLA, ABS, or other filaments, and could be used to service the printer itself. Someone may need only one or two particular wrenches to work on a vehicle, and individual wrenches are more affordable than an entire set (but the entire plastic wrench set is also much cheaper and lighter than a conventional wrench set)."
