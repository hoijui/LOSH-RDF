    okh:function "For the OSAT (Open Source Appropriate Technology), I chose to create a limb prosthetic as I felt it was a technology that is needed at a low cost. I set out by first researching other prosthetics. I found out that to attach a prosthetic, how it usually works is to put a sleeve on to the limb which then will adhere to the prosthetic by a strap with a clasp or other implementation. This will allow the prosthetic to have a tight fit (without squeezing the limb) and to also be attached to the prosthetic so that it could not slip off. I also looked at different types of hand prosthetics that are made and used." ;
