    okh:function "Can we trust in technology to provide us with abundant energy with no environmental impact?   == Improving the availability of work == The availability of work is a function of our ability to harness concentrated energy. Concentrated energy takes many forms: food, wood, coal, fuel gas, oil, etc. Civilization has become progressively more complex as the ability to harness increasingly concentrated energy sources has made more work available. Work is the building block of complex civilization." ;
