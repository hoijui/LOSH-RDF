    okh:function "By upgrading lighting components to more efficient and advanced technologies, lighting retrofits can greatly reduce energy consumption and lower energy bills, while maintaining current lighting levels and quality. These new technologies often have better lighting-quality characteristics, such as improved color, reduced flicker and greater light output for a given energy input. Improvements in lighting technologies can also lead to an increased lifetime for the components, which will reduce failures and frequency of maintenance activities. Consuming less electricity will also reduce the demand and associated emissions from \"off-site\" power generation. Facilities that are served by photovoltaic or other green-power systems can also experience complementary benefits from these upgrades since the reduction in demand will make these alternative power systems more economically and technically feasible." ;
