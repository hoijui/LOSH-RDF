    okh:function "Sustainable Tea Agriculture Project is a project sponsored by Lipton to work to get the tea farms in Turkey sustainably certified by the Rainforest Alliance.   == The Vision == Lipton's goal is to expand the tea production in Turkey, create more jobs for tea agriculture farmers, while following the Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan to protect the surrounding environment. They are committed to making Lipton's tea out of 100% of sustainable material by 2012. They hope to reduce the carbon footprint by half and double the production volume of tea by this time. Tea Farm in Rize Province, Turkey   == The Problem == Due to recent climate change and fertilizer misuse, tea production in Turkey is in the decline." ;
