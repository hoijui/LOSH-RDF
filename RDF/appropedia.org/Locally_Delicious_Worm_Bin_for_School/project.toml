function = "Locally Delicious is an organization working to re-localize Northern California, and the Six Rivers Region's food system. Their work is not only just about re-localizing food, but also changing the growing of food to a more organic, healthy matter. Locally Delicious is writing a new book, Lunchbox Envy, that aims to change the way children eat. One way to change this is to teach children how their waste can be used to grow the food they eat. This can be done by using a worm bin that creates healthier, more fertile soil, and reduces the environmental impact of organic wastes and chemical fertilizer."
