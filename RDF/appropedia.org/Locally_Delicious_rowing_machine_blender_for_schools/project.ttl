    okh:function "Locally Delicious is an organization based in Humboldt County, California that promotes sustainable lifestyles. In the past, this organization published a cookbook entitled Locally Delicious about cooking with and eating locally grown food and why it is important to do so. They are preparing to publish another book, Lunchbox EnvyTM. This book includes several do-it-yourself projects that compliment recipes and nutrition information also found in the book. These projects were designed by students enrolled in Engr 215 Introduction to Design at Humboldt State University. Groups of students were assigned separate projects with varying levels of involvement that kids can do alone, with the help of adults, or as a project conducted at their school." ;
