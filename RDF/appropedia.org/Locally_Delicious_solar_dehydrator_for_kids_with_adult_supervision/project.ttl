    okh:function "Our design team, Fujis and Fugees, consists of four Humboldt State University engineering students. For our Engineering 215 class in Spring 2011 we were given the assignment of designing a solar powered food dehydrator which could be replicated at home by kids with the help of an adult. As a part of our assignment we worked closely with the group Locally Delicious. Our final design will be integrated into Locally Delicious's upcoming cookbook along with instructions on how to build our solar dehydrator. In the following page you can view our documented design process." ;
