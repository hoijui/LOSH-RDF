Probably in some large urban centre with a university and access to the latest technology, right? Certainly not in a tiny rural village struggling to grow coffee on the volcanic slopes near Retalheuleu. But advanced vermicomposting, or worm composting, is the foundation of organic coffee production at Loma Linda. Coffee bean wastes are fed to composting worms in three long cement bins."
