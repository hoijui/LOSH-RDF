    okh:function "{   == Problem being addressed == Heart attacks are occurring at an increasing rate due to poor eating habits and less active lifestyles. Heart attacks occur without warning and require immediate attention and rapid treatment. As of now, itâ€™s extremely difficult to detect when a heart attack will occur.   == Detailed description of the solution == These nano sensors are able to detect a heart attack by measuring the stress symptom in the heart and converting it into an electrical signal. They can wirelessly transmit the signal to doctors for quick diagnosis and treatment." ;
