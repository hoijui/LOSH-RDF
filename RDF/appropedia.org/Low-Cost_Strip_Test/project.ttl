    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == There is a lack of an accurate, swift, and low-cost test for the diagnosis of TB. These factors make the disease prevalent in resource-limited settings, leading to the continued spreading of the disease.   == Detailed description of the solution == Partnering with industry and business, Madhukar Pai and his team seek to develop a simple strip test for extra-pulmonary TB with greater accuracy than current processes. A strip test generally involves the detection of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in urine. The presence of LAM in urine can rule-in TB in HIV-infected persons, and lead to the identification of, based on clinical trials, patients with advanced immunosuppression and thus a more severe form of TB. They plan to make each test cost less than two dollars.   == Designed by == Designed by: Madhukar Pai and the Pai Tuberculosis Research Group based at McGill Univeristy Manufacturer (if different): n/a Manufacturer location: n/a   == Funding Source == Received grant from Grand Challenges Canada as of Jun 29, 2011." ;
