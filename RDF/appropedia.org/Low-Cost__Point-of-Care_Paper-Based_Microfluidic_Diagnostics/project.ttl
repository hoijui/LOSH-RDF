    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Accurate, low-cost, point-of-care diagnostics for pregnant women and newborns are severely lacking in resource-limited rural settings. This is especially true where there are shortages of trained health workers to administer and evaluate diagnostic tests for life-threatening conditions such as pre-eclampsia. Accurate and low cost diagnostics for hypertension (pre-eclampsia) and high blood glucose (gestational diabetes) could help women get access to appropriate life-saving care.   == Detailed description of the solution == Two accurate, low-cost (<$0.10) postage stamp-sized paper-based diagnostics for expecting mothers and newborns will be used to detect – and enable proper treatment of – (i) anemia and hyper/hypoglycemia and (ii) hypertensive disorders. These point-of-care diagnostics require only a drop of blood or urine and require no additional steps beyond applying the sample." ;
