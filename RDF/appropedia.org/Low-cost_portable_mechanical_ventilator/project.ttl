    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Respiratory distress syndrome and birth asphyxia are major contributors to neonatal mortality in resource-limited settings. This is largely due to the high price and maintenance costs of standard ventilators. The manual operation of most ventilators also requires the presence of a health care worker, which is also a limitation in low resource settings. Manual ventilators also pose the potential danger of over pressurizing the patientâ€™s lungs, which can cause serious damage.   == Detailed description of the solution == This ventilator delivers breath through the compression of a conventional bag-valve mask with a pivoting cam arm, thus eliminating the need for a human operator." ;
