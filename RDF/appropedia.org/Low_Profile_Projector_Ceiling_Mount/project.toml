function = "The device designed for this project was a Low Profile Projector Ceiling Mount. After gifting my parents a projector for a soon to be home theater project, I realized I had not purchased a proper ceiling mount for the device. However, unlike more expensive models, there were no aftermarket mounts available for this projector as it is advertised as a portable projector, and not a home theater version. Utilizing the standard 1/4\" camera mounting thread on the base of the projector, I was able to purchase a high quality ball swivel from Amazon that is used to mount cameras. I then designed a low profile bracket that had a small shelf to manage the power supply, 4 through holes for attaching it to the ceiling, as well as a counter bored hex nut to secure the ball swivel to the bracket."
