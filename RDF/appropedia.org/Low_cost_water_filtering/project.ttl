    okh:function "This article deals around the set-up of a (extremely) low cost water filtration system. Water filtration can be used if there are few or no other options of obtaining (pure) water from other sources: ie rainwater, groundwater (rather than surface water), ... If no filtering needs to be done at all on water, it is generally cheaper, and it also avoids the use of energy (and possible air pollution). Things will depend on the local context (water source availability) however.   == Purpose ==  The purpose of setting up the explained low-cost sytem of the water filtration is to make water clean of debris/particles as well as the worst filth." ;
