    okh:function "Community-scale energy planning entails concerted efforts for realizing localized energy and emission plans geared towards achieving energy sustainable communities. This is largely under-investigated for the developing world together with exploring the synergies between community planning and energy planning strategies. This study performs community-scale energy planning from 2015 to 2040 for Onyen-okpon and Giere, two rural communities in Nigeria. Utilizing the hybrid integration approach with the Low Emissions Analysis Platform model, the study investigates the implications for transforming rural communities to sustainable renewable based energy supply and quantitatively analyses the strategy integration based on four scenarios: the reference scenario and three composite demand side management scenarios. The results show that the integration of strategies has clear benefits with the composite scenarios availing reduced energy use with significant reductions in energy demand and greenhouse gases emissions." ;
