    okh:function "There is a pretty simple idea behind this OSAT project and concept is straight forward. A simple snap system that can be used in multiple ways. Something like a snap system might not seem like much but think of the idea when you don't have retail outlets close to you. Snaps can be used in a variety of ways; shirts, coats, satchels or bags, or any other system that would be desired to hold together. This simple idea of a snap system and the varities of of uses make this an aopporiate OSAT project." ;
