    okh:function "[verification needed]  This page is serious need of references.   == Introduction == Solar power could be collected on the moon. Many different beams of 12cm wavelength microwaves would deliver power to receivers at sites located worldwide. Each receiver would supply commercial power to a given region. Such a receiver, called a rectenna, would consist of a large field of small rectifying antennas." ;
