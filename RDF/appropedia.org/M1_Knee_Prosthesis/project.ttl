    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == 80 percent of the amputees in the world live in developing countries. Common causes of amputation are war, landmines, car accidents, industrial or farming related accidents, natural disasters, and lack of health awareness, which leads to diabetes, gangrene, and infection. The recent earthquake in Haiti has led to over 100,000 new amputees. When a person loses a limb, they are faced with emotional and financial lifestyle changes. The cost of a prosthetic limb in a developing country is found to range from $125 to $1875 USD. The cost of a prosthetic limb in the USA ranges from $5,000-$15,000 USD (Berry 2005)." ;
