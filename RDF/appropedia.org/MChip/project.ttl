    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Women in resource-poor settings, especially in rural areas, suffer from adverse health consequences resulting from late or lack of detection of sexually transmitted infections. Women tend to forgo these diagnostic tests because they are usually conducted in clinics far away and take a long time to produce results. These infections pose a threat to newborns as well.   == Detailed description of the solution == mChip is a simple, low-cost, accurate, and innovative microfluidics-based diagnostic device that can detect both HIV and syphilis simultaneously within 15 minutes. It requires only a finger-prick volume of blood and uses its integrated GPRS mobile health capability to perform real-time synchronization of data to a central health record through cell-phone networks or orbiting satellites." ;
