function = "Polypropylene (PP) filament is a new semi crystalline thermoplastic used in Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). PP filament has a high level of flexibility. Printing temperature for Polypropylene filament is around 210 – 230°C --so you need to use an enhanced hot end. Warning: Once polypropylene filament has passed through the hot end, subsequent printing with lower temperature PLA filament has not worked due to excessive friction in the hot end. The temperature must be increased to 240° C to continue printing with PLA. This has been confirmed with three different hot ends."
