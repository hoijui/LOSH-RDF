The trapezoidal-threaded lead screws had a 5 mm pitch and were 300 mm in length. The three motors were arranged vertically on a 394 mm circle, spaced 120° apart. In general, the 3-axis stage was based upon an industrial delta robot design commonly used for pick-and-place operations, except allowing for greater movement in the z-direction. Control was provided by an Arduino-based controller." ;
