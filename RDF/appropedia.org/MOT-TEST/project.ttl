    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Malaria is a global health threat that puts over 2 billion people worldwide in danger. To accurately identify these cases, quick and cheap diagnostic technology is required. However, most antibody-based rapid diagnostic technologies (RDTs) can degrade in the field and none can identify every strain of the malaria parasite.   == Detailed description of the solution == MOT-TEST is an innovative and unique proposed product that is designed based on magneto-optical properties of infected red blood cells to malaria. Infected red blood cells with malaria in comparison to normal cells have different magneto-optical properties." ;
