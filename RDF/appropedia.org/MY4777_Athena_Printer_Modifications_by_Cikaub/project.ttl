    okh:function "This page outlines one possible method to expand the Athena printer with a heated bed that still allows for the addition of extuder fans and secondary hotends. Project Created by: User:Cikaub User:Chrissy Kaub   == Design == Athena printer was equipted with a 12v 220mm diameter heated bed to replace the basic tempered glass surface. As it is desirable to have a fan mounted on the hotend to assist in printer slow freezing plastics like PLA the mod also entails the replacement of printer controller and power supply. The beaglebone and melzi controller are replaced with an arduino mega compatible micro controller with RAMPS 1.4 shield so that secondary hotends and fans may still be added to the printer.   === Features === Expanded I/O for second hot end and extruder controls built-in Fully integrated controller allows for SD card printing without the need for a tethered PC Hotend fan and heated bed allows for fast and effective printing of ABS and PLA Socketed stepper controllers allows for easy and economical replacement without the need to rework PCB as with melzi   == Construction and BOM ==   === Bill of Materials ===   === Construction ===  placeholder steps Step 1: Teardown Remove the Melzi unit and the I/O breakout, disconnect all the stepper drivers and note what wire pairs are what coils." ;
