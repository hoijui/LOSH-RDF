    okh:function "Nicole Vincent designed a rainwater catchment system for the residential property located at 1402 M St in Eureka, California. The owners of the house are principals with Democracy Unlimited of Humboldt County (DUHC). DUHC is a non-profit organization that educates citizens about the illegitimate seizure of our authority to govern ourselves. They design and implement grassroots strategies that exercise democratic power over corporations and governments. DUHC seek to create a truly democratic society by provoking a non-violent popular uprising against corporate rule in Humboldt County that can serve as a model for other communities across the United States.If you would like to learn more about DUHC please check out there website at www.DUHC.org The rainwater catchment at 1402 M St is just the beginning of their move towards sustainability." ;
