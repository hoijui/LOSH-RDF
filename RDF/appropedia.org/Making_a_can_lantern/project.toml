function = "The can lantern is a very simple way to make a lantern that throws light in a pretty pattern of your choice. It makes use of an opened can that would otherwise be recycled, giving it a new use for a while longer.   == Preparing the can == Find a suitable can for making the lantern from. A standard food can is perfect, just ensure that there are no rough parts from where the can lid was removed. Clean the can out completely using warm, soapy water."
