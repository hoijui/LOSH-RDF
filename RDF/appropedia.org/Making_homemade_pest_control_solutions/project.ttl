    okh:function """This page contains a selection of recipes of homemade pest control solutions. Homemade pest control solutions focus on using plants, soaps, spices, coffee grounds, mulches, etc., known to be able to control pests in the garden, safely and effectively. Such solutions can be of great benefit to gardeners and small-scale farmers, as many homemade pest control solutions can be made from locally available materials for little cost but with good effect. Such solutions can aid persons seeking to farm or grow plants organically (namely, without the use of conventional commercially-produced pesticides) and to those who are concerned about the effects of such products on the environment and on human health. For people who wish to use these homemade solutions, the aim is to avoid using manufactured products that frequently contain much harsher chemicals and synthetic products that can have health and safety concerns.
