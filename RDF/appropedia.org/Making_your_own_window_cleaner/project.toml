Fortunately, there are various ways to make your own window cleaner to fix this problem in a jiffy (just add elbow grease!). You might be curious as to why vinegar features in so many window cleaner recipes––basically, it's because it works to cut through grime, restore the clarity of the glass and reduces streaks. The other additions provide different assistance, so it can be a good idea to try different ones to see which work the best for you. Feel free to add more examples of effective, eco-friendly window cleaners."
