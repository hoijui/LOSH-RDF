function = "The purpose of this project was to determine whether laminate flooring or Marmoleum which is a brand of linoleum, has the least impact on the environment. We were asked by, Sean Armstrong, of Danco Construction in Arcata, California to measure this impact in terms of CO2. This spreadsheet can be considered by people looking for green flooring to base their decision on the information we have found about each products. Our research includes information on CO2 from transportation and production, as well as materials in which the floorings are composed of. The conclusion is up to the reader to decide which one is better than the other, depending on which aspect(s) the reader is more concerned about."
