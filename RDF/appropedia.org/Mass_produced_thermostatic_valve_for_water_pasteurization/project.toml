function = "The purpose of this project is to create a thermostatic valve that can be used in a solar water pasteurization unit. Water pasteurization is a vital part of maintaining health standards in less fortunate parts of the world. The development of this project came from the investigation into building a health care centre in Peru. Research on this issue returned the fact one of the largest health problems in Peru is the lack of safe and clean drinking water [2]. Bacteria from unsafe drinking water can lead to serious health problems which cannot always be properly dealt with in countries such as Peru where the health care system may not have all the resources needed."
