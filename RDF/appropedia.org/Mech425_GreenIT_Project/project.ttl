    okh:function "Through Queen`s University`s Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering course Mech425, students are developing an open source database of energy conservation measures (ECMs) which can be used to evaluate the economic and environmental benefits of numerous technologies, systems, and processes. By quantifying the economic and environmental benefits in a standard and transparent form, it is hoped that these ECMs will provide businesses and homeowners with reliable information to assess the feasibility of improving their environmental impact, and simultaneously, their bottom line. This page is for Green IT projects for Mech 425. You can download the 14 page project File:MECH425 green ITS Project Final Jan 20.doc in doc format. Thus you can edit the consent forms, etc." ;
