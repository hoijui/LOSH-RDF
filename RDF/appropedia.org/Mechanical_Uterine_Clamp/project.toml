function = "== Problem being addressed == Uterine atony, a loss of uterine muscle tone after cesarean birth, affects more than three million women each year. It can lead to potentially fatal postpartum hemorrhage, and treatment in low-resource clinical setting is often inadequate.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Mechanical Uterine Clamp applies three different levels of compression to the uterus after a cesarean section. This device is simple to use and an inexpensive alternative to uterine massage.   == Designed by == Designed by: This device was designed by a team of five engineering students at the University of Virginia through a course offered by Timothy Allen, an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering."
