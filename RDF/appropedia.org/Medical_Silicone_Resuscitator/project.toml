function = "== Problem being addressed == Every year an estimated 4 million babies die in their first four weeks of life. Birth asphyxia (when a baby does not breathe at birth) is the third most common cause of newborn deaths. Limited data suggest that deaths due to birth asphyxia have remained relatively unchanged in developing countries.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device was designed for babies with little to no breathing. This bag-and-mask medical silicone resuscitator is ideal for use in developing countries because of its low cost of production and reusability."
