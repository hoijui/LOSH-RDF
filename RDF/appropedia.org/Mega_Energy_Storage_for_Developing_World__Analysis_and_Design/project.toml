Countries struggling with other problems such as economic shortage or poverty could be affected badly by these natural disasters. Crisis management has been long received much attention among practitioners, especially in developing countries where infrastructure is vulnerable. In this study, using the state of art knowledge, that is the solar energy, as well as some other sciences; we proposed a cost-effective and efficient way to design a valuable device for a vulnerable community aiming to address solutions alleviating the sophisticated conditions and suggesting implications regarding crisis control and management. The solar trailer is considered one of the ways to use and exploit renewable energies in crisis circumstances.\nCrisis management, Energy storage, Hybrid mobile system"
