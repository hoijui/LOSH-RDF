    okh:function "Currently, the majority of electronic waste is disposed of in a landfill. The remainder is processed in an energy inefficient manner, where only small amounts of the available metals are recovered. This is a problem for a number of reasons.  This waste contains recoverable trace amounts of precious metals, and larger quantities of a variety of other metals and alloys, especially copper, aluminium and steel. Electronic waste contains high concentrations of heavy metals, brominated flame retardants, and other plastic additives that have proven to have adverse effects on humans." ;
