function = "This OSAT is a Micro Lathe. It uses an open source three jaw, self centering chuck, which can be found here. The frame, while in Beta, is nearly parametric in order to scale to the supplies the end user has on hand, and can be altered to meet their needs. Current OpenScad files can be found here. Warning, this project is still in beta, and as such, printing those scad files without modification will not result in a perfectly functional tool."
