function = "This micro water turbine can be paired with a DC generator for power generation applications. The micro design allows for the turbine to be extremely portable and light weight, allowing for power to be available to remote areas. The micro turbine will only produce a small amount of power allowing the user to charge a battery, cell phone, or other small device.   == Bill of Materials == A Delta Athena II printer or similar 3D printer 146 g of 3D printing filament 8x 3 mm screw or bolts with nuts 1x 3-12 V DC generator 1 x 50 mm circular rubber seal 40 mm of rubber sealing screw driver or other tool to fix bolts scissor may be needed to cut rubber sealing.
