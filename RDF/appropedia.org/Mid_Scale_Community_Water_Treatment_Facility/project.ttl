    okh:function "Clean water is necessary for every person on the planet however without access to a means of treating source water, many people go without clean water. A cheap and simple method for treating water from any source would be necessary to provide for people in developing countries. The treatment facility outlined in the excel file and detailed in the provided CAD drawings is relatively inexpensive yet very effective for removing both inorganic and organic contaminants. It should be noted that the actual design has not been tested, however the theory of settling and slow sand filtration is well tested and used throughout the world.   = Slow Sand Filtration =   == Settling == The design of a settling tank is constrained by the particles which need to be removed." ;
