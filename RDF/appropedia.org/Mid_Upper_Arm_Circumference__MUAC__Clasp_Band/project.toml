function = "For an up to date, tested and peer-reviewed version see: 3-D printing open-source click-MUAC bands for identification of malnutrition  Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) is measured on children suspected of being malnourished. The cut off for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is 115mm. MUAC is traditionally measured using a tape measure like device, but there is a need for a simpler method. The \"Click-MUAC\" concept is for a band that clicks closed only if the child's arm is â‰¤115mm. It is important that this band be accurate, somewhat durable, and very easy to use."
