    okh:function "The mineral sifter is an excellent example of OSAT. Sifters are a major time saver, especially in third world countries where simple appliances are difficult to come by. This sifter can be used in a variety of different ways ranging from cooking to gardening.   == Bill of Materials == PLA or any other available 3D printable plastic The link to download this design can be found here [1]   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == No special skills were used to produce this sifter, other than basic 3D printing knowledge.   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == My print was made by extruding the PLA at 205C. The print was made using a 20% hexagonal infill, the infill pattern had very little affect on the overall rigidity of the final piece, and be used for the application. There is no assembly process, as the design is one simple printed part." ;
