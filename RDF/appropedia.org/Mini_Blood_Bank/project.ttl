    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of death in developing countries due to the lack of donated blood. Several problems exist with the current blood donation practices. In many developing nations, less than 0.25% of the population donates blood. Also, in many remote areas white blood cells are not separated out which is unsafe because white blood cells can illicit an immune response.   == Detailed description of the solution == This mini blood bank is a portable disposable blood separation device which uses hollow microfibers and gravity to separate the blood components." ;
