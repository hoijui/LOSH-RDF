function = "== Problem being addressed == In the poorest countries, there are 500 million maternal deaths, 3.2 million still births, and 4 million neonatal deaths each year. There are many problems that cause these deaths, but one in particular is the lack of diagnostic capability for birth complications before birth occurs. Ultrasound is often used in developed nations. However, ultrasound machines are quite expensive (around $20,000).   == Detailed description of the solution == Bringing an ultrasound to resource-poor settings such as Uganda is estimated to cost around $3,500."
