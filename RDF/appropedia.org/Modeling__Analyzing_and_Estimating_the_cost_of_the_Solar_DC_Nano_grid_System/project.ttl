    okh:function """Even though there is a vast advancement in the generation of electricity, some of the rural areas of Bangladesh still do not have access to it. Again, electricity is generated by using conventional fossil fuel technologies. So to generate bulk amount of power without using conventional techniques leads us to an innovative solution-solar power. An approach towards achieving rural electrification in Bangladesh is the use of a solar DC Nano grid system- an isolated grid which can generate and distribute power to a cluster of households at close proximity reliably. My research work proposes a model of DC Nano grid integrated with solar PV module which can supply electricity up to 20 households at a distance of about 1 km.
