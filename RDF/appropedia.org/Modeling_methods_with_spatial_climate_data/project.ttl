    okh:function "The World Radiation Data Centre http://web.archive.org/web/20180905172849/http://wrdc-mgo.nrel.gov:80/ keeps records of radiation of hundreds of ground weather stations throughout the world. It seems that these data were updated until 1993, however it is not very easy to access them.  In terms of Canada alone there is a nice presentation on the current warehouses of these data http://me.queensu.ca/courses/MECH430/Assets/Files/Recommended%20Reading/Weather%20Data%20From%20Environment%20Canada.pdf.Again to access these data requires contacting people and we would much prefer some right at hand resource. RETscreen comes in handy. (By the way, is it possible to transfer a file from here directly onto an Excel spreadsheet?) What one also notices is that the locations of the weather stations are hardly close to the sites we conduct study (otherwise life is easy) so the way to go is to fit the data into a function, on which we can approximate the values of the site in question." ;
