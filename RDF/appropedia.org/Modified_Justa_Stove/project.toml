function = "The Modified Justa Stove is a version of the Justa stove. This particular version is being disseminated by Foro Para el Desarollo Sostentable Stove Dissemination Program located in San Cristobal de las Casas Chiapas. The Foro stove team refers to this stove as the Justa Mejorada which in Spanish means the \"Improved Justa.\" This page is titled \"Modified Justa\" because calling this stove an \"Improved Justa\" may be misleading given that there have been no laboratory or field tests done on this stove. The main modification that characterizes this Modified Justa from the original Justa is in the design of the combustion chamber. The combustion chamber of the Justa has a classical rocket box shape, made of metal or tile, that has been proven in laboratories to lead to highly efficient transference of energy from the biomass fuel to the cooking surface."
