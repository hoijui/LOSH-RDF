    okh:function "The idea of combining a spoon with a fork has existed for years now. For certain situations, this innovation can be more efficient (for example, on camping trips). On websites, such as thingiverse.com the 3D designs of sporks are very delicate and require support structures to print. This means that the outcome can look a bit bad because of all the support needed. The goal with this design was to create a design that can be printed on a flat surface without the help of support structures, thus ensuring a better quality spork." ;
