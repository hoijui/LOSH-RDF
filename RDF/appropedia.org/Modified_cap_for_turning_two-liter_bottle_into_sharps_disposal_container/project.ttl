    okh:function "This project is appropriate because it uses post-consumer containers and an easily 3-D printable part to replace the need for manufacturing new sharps containers. This is a remixed cap designed to screw onto a two-liter coke bottle so that used hypodermic needles can be deposited into the container. The tapered funnel-like shape on the underside of the cap is to allow needles to more freely enter the container with reduced risk of coming back out. this lid was designed to screw on to ensure a tight fit so the lid doesn't come off  . This also re-uses post-consumer plastic containers to reduce plastic waste." ;
