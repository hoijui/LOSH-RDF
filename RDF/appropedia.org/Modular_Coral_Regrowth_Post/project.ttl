    okh:function "With recent destruction of coral reefs due to marine pollution, there are movements within marine biology for conservation efforts of coral. When coral breaks off of its reef, it can regenerate if placed into a nourishing environment. To ashe sist with efforts to help grow these rare corals, I created a modular post that can be used to hold pieces of coral while they regrow. The posts are of a modular design, and can be built up to allow for more coral to be placed on a single vertical post. The rods slide through the post, and with string tied to the holes on each rod, are tied to the coral so it doesn't move." ;
