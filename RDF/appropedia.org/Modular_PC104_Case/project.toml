function = "PC104 stacks are commonly used in automation and controls applications which could be a potentially hazardous environment for sensitive electronics The goal for this project was to create an easily 3D printed, easily modifiable, and fully modular case for a PC104 stack of unknown size.   == Design ==  \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t   === Variables === Height should be 17mm for a single and 34 for a double height module. Keep the outer clearance above 12.7mm to allow room for mating connectors. Decreasing wall thickness beyond 10mm may compromise mounting holes. The connector holes are stored in an array of an array of parameters."
