    okh:function "The modular pegboard is designed to replace more costly methods of tool storage. I chose to create a customizable pegboard due to the large number of applications that it can be used for. This pegboard can be used to expand an existing pegboard since it will work with standard 1/8 inch pegboard attachments. This technology addresses sustainable development goals number 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth),9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). The pegboard can improve goal number 8 by allowing working people to have an affordable solution to their tool storage needs, since they would have a higher net income, by spending less money on commercial tool storage solutions." ;
