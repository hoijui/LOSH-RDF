    okh:function "With a modular setup, this device can be used as multiple tools in one. Main applications could be for people from third world countries where there is minimal automation. A shovel helper grip attachment could save a lot of effort by transferring some of the load from the user's back to the well gripped other hand. This in-turn results into lesser fatigue and more productivity. Also, the Leaf Claws attachment can function as a big sized leaf collector hand or as even a shovel for damp yards." ;
