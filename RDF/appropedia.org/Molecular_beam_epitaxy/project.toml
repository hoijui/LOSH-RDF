function = "Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is a material fabrication process used to produce high-purity nano-scale materials. A material is grown through interactions between a substrate and one or more beams of atoms or molecules incident upon the substrate's surface. The beams are generated by sublimation of a solid source material. The entire process is performed under ultra high vacuumW. MBE exhibits many advantages over similar thin film deposition processes, like vapour deposition. Some of these advantages are: significantly improved purity, arbitrarily sharp deposition resolution, and operation at low temperatures.\nProduce high-purity nano-scale materials"
