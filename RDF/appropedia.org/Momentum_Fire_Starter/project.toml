function = "OSAT stands for Open Source Appropriate Technology and this tool is a clever solution to a age old human need for fire. Using your bare hands to spin a stick back and forth with enough force to create the friction needed for fire causes blisters and other wounds to form on the hands. Especially if the first attempt is unsuccessful. With this tool and a skilled user, many fires could be started much quicker and the user would have no blisters. The scad file can be customized for most sticks and rope can be hand woven from plant fiber."
