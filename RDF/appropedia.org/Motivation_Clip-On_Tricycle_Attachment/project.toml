function = "== Problem being addressed == Many standard wheelchairs are not suitable for long distance travel over rough terrain, and those that can withstand prolonged use in these environments are often prohibitively expensive.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device is designed to easily attach to the Motivation Rough Terrain Wheelchair. It converts the wheelchair into a hand-powered tricycle. It involves one 20-inch wheel in the front and both running breaks and parking breaks for safety.   == Relevance to developing country settings == This device was designed for developing world settings."
