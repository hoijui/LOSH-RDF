    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Standard 4-wheel wheelchairs are effective for flat surfaces and can be manufactured inexpensively, but are not ideal for rural or rough terrain and are difficult to maneuver.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Motivation Rough Terrain Wheelchair is a 3-wheel base chair, with two large wheels in the back, and one large rubber castor wheel in front. The frame is built mostly of steel with aluminum components. The seat cushion has a water-resistant cover and is contoured for pressure-reduction. It can be cut to most aptly fit the individual user." ;
