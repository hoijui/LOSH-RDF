    okh:function "The multi-functional platform is a cost effective piece of machinery directed at third world and developing countries, which uses simple renewable energy solutions in order to provide a variety of end-use equipment and greatly reduce the amount of time and energy needed to perform everyday tasks.. The project was developed initially for the West African countries of Mali and Burkina Faso by the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)W..   == Description of the Platform == The platform is constructed around a simple diesel engine, which essentially is used to power a number of different mechanical components including, but not limited to, a grain millW, dehuller, pressing machine, and various tools and carpentry equipment. It is built, installed and maintained locally using readily available equipment, thus eliminating the need to spend money on the import of materials from other countries. Another key feature of the platform is its water pumping and electricity generating capabilities." ;
