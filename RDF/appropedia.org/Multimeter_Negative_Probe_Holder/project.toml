function = "This tool is used to hold the negative probe when reading voltages on motor control boards for the Athena2 3D printer. It could be modified to fit another printer setup. The model was created using FreeCAD.   == Understanding the market == This product is complete and it functions as a negative probe holder. A video of it functioning can be found in the link below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBmED1PZYD0&feature=youtu.be   == Project goals == Item should hold the negative probe so that two hands are free to measure motor control board voltages.   == Design == FreeCAD, STL and gcode files are attached: https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-athena-2-multimeter-negative-probe-holder-104960   === 3-D Printable Parts === The entire tool is 3D printable."
