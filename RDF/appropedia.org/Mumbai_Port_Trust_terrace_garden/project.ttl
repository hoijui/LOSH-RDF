    okh:function "The central kitchen of Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) distributes food to approximately 3,000 employees daily, generating valuable amounts of organic waste. A terrace garden created by staff recycles ninety percent of this waste, and produces vegetables and fruits. Preeti Patil, the catering officer at the MBPT explains the purpose of the enterprise:  \"Mumbai Port Trust has developed an organic farm on the terrace of its central kitchen, which is an area of approximately 3000 sqft [300 m2]. The activity of city farming was started initially to dispose of kitchen organic waste in an ecofriendly way." ;
