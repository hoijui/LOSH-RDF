function = "== Problem being addressed == Post-Partum hemorrhage is the cause for 8% of direct pregnancy-related deaths in industrialized countries and 25% of maternal deaths in the developing world. In trauma patients, hemorrhagic shock is the second most frequent cause of death.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device is a low signal oximetry sensor that uses occlusion spectroscopy. Pressure is applied by a sensor around the finger, which obstructs blood flow. An optical signal is measured with a blood specific high signal to noise ratio."
