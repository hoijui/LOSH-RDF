function = "== Problem being addressed == Villages in Namibia and other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa are often long distances from clinics and hospitals. There is an immense need for emergency medical transportation that is cost effective, but still able to quickly transport patients in need of emergency care.   == Detailed description of the solution == The prototyping phase has produced two different bicycle ambulance devices. The first is a large ambulance that has a removable stretcher. The second is much smaller with a fixed-angle stretcher that is also removable."
