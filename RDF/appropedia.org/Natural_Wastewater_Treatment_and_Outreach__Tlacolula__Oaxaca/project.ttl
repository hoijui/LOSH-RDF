    okh:function "The City of Tlacolula, with about 20,000 residents, is served by a highly insufficient pond wastewater treatment system. Currently, the plant discharges the equivalent of raw wastewater to the Oaxaca Valley watershed. The City is working with Engineers Without Borders (EWB) and the Autonomous University of Benito Juarez in Oaxaca (UAJBO) to use wastewater as a resource for agriculture and to create a community park focused on recreation, education, and tourism through a beneficial use plan. The project goals provide the municipality with an upgraded design incorporating natural wastewater treatment systems to reclaim wastewater for agriculture. The project increases public awareness on the importance of wastewater treatment, demonstrates natural treatment system technology, diversifies wildlife habitat and boosts the microeconomy." ;
