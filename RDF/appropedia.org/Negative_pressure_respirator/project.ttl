Limited trained healthcare workers with specialised airway skills.   == Detailed description of the solution == After further research which is happening in this Google doc and this helpful engineering Slack channel Consider taking the widely used 1950s Both Respirator design, give it an appropriate technology makeover and release it under an open-source licence   == Designed by == Case designed by: Edward Both https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Both_respirator Pump design under development, the initial idea is to use a car window motor or linear actuator (where available) to move an upturned bucket up and down at the surface of a dustbin of water. Manufacturer: Makerspaces, DIY Manufacturer location: Almost anywhere   == When and where it was tested/implemented == Widely used in the 1940s and 1950's. Can be easily constructed from readily available materials." ;
