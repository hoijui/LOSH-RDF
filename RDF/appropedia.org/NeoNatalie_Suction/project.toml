function = "== Problem being addressed == Newborn infants often require resuscitation and suction to clear blockages in the respiratory tract. Current tools are expensive and require training.   == Detailed description of the solution == The NeoNatalie Suction device is shaped like a penguin. Its beak provides easy access to the nose and mouth. It consists of a single piece of silicone that can be boiled, autoclaved, and reused hundreds of times."
