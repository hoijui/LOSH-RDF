function = "== Problem being addressed == Preterm birth is a major contributor to neonatal deaths and low birth weight babies are at high risk. These babies are also susceptible because they are unable to effectively maintain their body temperature to stay warm. Incubators are needed to keep the babies at a warm temperature until they can effectively maintain their own body temperatures.   == Detailed description of the solution == NeoNurture is based on using recycled car parts in order to build a low-cost incubator. It uses sealed-beam headlights as a heating element, a dashboard fan for convective heat circulation, signal lights and a door chime serve as alarms, and a motorcycle battery and car cigarette lighter provide backup power during incubator transport and power outages."
