This program was hosted by the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Western Ontario and administered by the How to Change the World Organization from November 2nd, 2021 to November 5th, 2021.  The given task was as follows: \"You and your team have been asked by the Government of Uganda with its capital in Kampala to develop a proposal for how the community can respond to the challenges and opportunities associated with \"good health and wellbeing‚Äù. This is a core element of UN Sustainable Development Goal #3 which is centered on ensuring healthy living and promoting well-being for all ages. SDG #3 takes into consideration the dilating economic and social inequalities, climate and environmental impacts of urbanization and industrialization as well as the continuing burden of HIV and other communicable and non-communicable diseases." ;
