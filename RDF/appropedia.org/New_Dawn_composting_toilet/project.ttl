    okh:function "This composting toilet is in use at New Dawn Herbalism School and Farm in Costa Rica.   === Priorities for design and construction === Low cost Reduce or eliminate underground water contamination Prevent pathogen parasitic infections through manipulation of humanure Include bamboo as a renewable resource in the construction   === Construction Procedure === A hole was excavated in the earth at the toilet site 1m wide and 1m deep A 1mx1m culvert pipe made from concrete was lowered into the hole A cement floor was added to the bottom of the culvert pipe to prevent fecal matter from leaking into the soil, and potentially contaminating the underground water table. A top for the toilet was constructed using a wooden form poured with fine sand and cement. 1/4inch rebar was used to strengthen the 2 inch thick slab. The top of a plastic 5 gallon water bottle was used as the urine trap and was attached to the bottom of the top for the toilet." ;
