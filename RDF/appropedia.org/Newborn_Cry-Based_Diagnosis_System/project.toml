function = "== Problem being addressed == Newborn cries can be influenced by the physiological and neurological state of the child. Information about the source of the newborn’s discomfort, which could be benign or indicative of a serious health problem, can be collected from the newborn’s cries. Diseases, infections, or deformities can change an infant’s cry by affecting the central nervous system, respiratory organs, or oral cavities. It has been shown that infants with particular diseases produce cries with certain consistent attributes (Alaie, 2012). Identifying health issues in infants in low-resource settings is difficult due to a lack of diagnostic equipment."
