    okh:function "The need was expressed for a device in which could turn waste newspaper and other light paper products into small burnable briquettes. This helps to turn waste in to a usable fuel source, and also allows the paper to burn much longer and more efficiently than just burning the unprocessed paper.   == Bill of Materials == BOM -- Materials needed: are both 3D printed and items picked up at the local hardware store  The base, lower plate and upper crushing plate are all 3D printed and can be found on the following link Thingiverse Link to Files Youmagine link coming soon! The steel rod was purchased at the local hardware store, can be replaced with alternative source that can fit in 3/8 inch holes. The wood handles were made from scrap wood found in the garage, and held together using 8 woods screw." ;
