function = "== Problem being addressed == Conventional prosthetics are often poorly designed for use in the developing world where rugged roads and conditions can render prosthetics weak and easily breakable. Amputees with frail prosthetic limbs cannot continue their active lifestyles to their fullest potential.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Niagara Foot combines flexibility, durability and comfort in a cost-effective design. Its unique S-shaped heel is injection-molded from impacted-resistant HytrelÂ® 8238 thermoplastic polyester elastomer and acts like a spring to provide energy storage and return during the gait cycle, much like walking normally. It helps to decrease muscular strain as well."
