    okh:function "Why should education be improved for the billions of impoverished students worldwide? Because progress for these impoverished students is dependent upon their education, which must improve in order for them to be successful. Poverty is a disadvantage, affecting students differently, dependent upon their situation.  Poverty reduces the chance of young people to study at home. Cramped interior space used by many people along with insufficient interior lighting are negative factors to be overcome." ;
