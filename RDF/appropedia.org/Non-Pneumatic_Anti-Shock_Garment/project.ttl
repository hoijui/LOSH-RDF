    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Obstetrical hemorrhage is heavy bleeding of a woman during or right after pregnancy. Many women die from hemorrhaging because they are not within close reach of a hospital and are in resource limited clinic settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Non-Pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment (NASG), delivers circumferential counter pressure to the lower body, legs, pelvis, and abdomen. The counter pressure decreased the contained size, reduced blood flow in compressed area, while the blood to the uncompressed area (core organs) is enhanced. The pressure applied by NASG does not exceed 70 mmHg, hence avoiding potential ischemia or compartment syndrome." ;
