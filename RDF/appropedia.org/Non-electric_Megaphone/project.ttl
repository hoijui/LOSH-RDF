    okh:function "This megaphone is OSAT appropriate because there are practical uses for such a device in developing countries. A few examples would be alerting others to danger, or speaking to a crowd of people, or cheering during a sports match. Given how much electronic megaphones cost, my megaphone design is a preferrable alternative. The only way electric megaphones could be worth purchasing in developing countries would be if they were as cheap or cheaper to produce and sell than the 3D design I made.   == Bill of Materials == 60g of filament Click here to access the SCAD and STL files used in the printer A Jellybox 3D printer (preferrable)   == Tools needed == Jellybox or similar RepRap 3-D printer Roughly 60g of filament A computer or SD card for holding the STL file And that's it!" ;
