function = "North Korea is a totalitarian stalinist government headed by Kim Jong-il, which maintains control through strict governmental isolation and ideology. The country is plagued by pollution, corruption, widespread famine, and energy shortage. Without consistantly produced energy, the country has had trouble exporting products. Without the monetary support produced from the exportation of resources, the country struggles to feed and provide for it's own people. Today, the country struggles to maintain it's decaying energy system and relies almost primarly on oil subsidies from China and international food aid from the United States and South Korea."
