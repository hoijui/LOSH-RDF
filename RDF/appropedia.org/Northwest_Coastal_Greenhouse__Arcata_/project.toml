function = "This greenhouse design project is geared for use in the Northern California coastal region, which is known for its cool, wet winters. The combination of frequent rainfall (between 5-7 inches of rainfall per month from November through March), sparse sunlight, and cool temperatures (average daily min around 40F to average daily max around 55F) can make local gardening[4] and agriculture difficult. The constant excess moisture and lack of drying warmth lead to a host of problems including soil compaction, mold, and other problems which affect both plants as well as composting microbes and earthworms. The purpose of the project is to overcome some of these constraints. The greenhouse design must effectively raise the minimum daily temperature relative to the outside air and effectively protect the plants, compost, and vermiculture bin from the elements."
