    okh:function "NUBIAN'S OASIS GREYWATER RECYCLING ATTRACTS COMMERCIAL INTEREST FROM WATER SOLUTIONS ENGINEERS Greywater recycling in apartment blocks, hotels, schools, townhouses and commercial buildings is now feasible using Nubian's OASIS greywater recycling process in the system design. Engineers are seeking compact, above ground equipment that allows recycling of greywater for irrigation or internal reuse in toilets and laundries. Property investors, offering sustainable \"Green Buildings\" to environmentally responsible tenants, can install economic OASIS systems that save substantial amounts of drinking water â€“ up to 60% of conventional usage patterns. Nubian has a portfolio of active projects in apartments, offices, hotels, schools and mine sites throughout Australia. ACT and QLD new regulations for commercial developments require alternative water sources be specified, and greywater recycling offers consistent and meaningful water savings." ;
