function = "OSAT is technology that can be used to help advance third-world countries, but in ways that makes the most sense to those areas. For starters, the type of technology is best when is relatively sustainable. Furthermore, it is also extremely helpful when the technology runs off of parts and materials that can be developed locally and does not require large purchases. These things help prevent an area from becoming self-sustainable. 3D printers are working to be a huge contribution to OSAT. Some printers, like the JellyBox, have open source designs and can use open source files to print very useful objects."
