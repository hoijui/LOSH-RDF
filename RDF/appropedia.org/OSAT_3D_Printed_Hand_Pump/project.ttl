Hand pumps are needed in across the globe for the distribution of water, oil, and other liquids. Assembly of this device takes less than one minute with little effort. This design is most effective when used for pumping liquids from a bucket/barrel into a smaller container. However modifications and more components can be added to the design to make the pump applicable to more situations." ;
