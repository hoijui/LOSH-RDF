    okh:function "This OSAT project is appropriate for countries where bikes are heavily relied on and cheap spare parts are helpful and necessary. In many countries people may be unable to afford replacement parts so this project provides a much cheaper alternative that is also very quick to access.   == Bill of Materials == The project comes in either 2 or 3 parts. Depending on the size of your 3d printer, you may have to print the seat in 2 prints. My 3D printer was only able to print 200mm x 200mm which is too small for the desired product." ;
