function = "Jump rope handles. What more is there to be said? Kids who need exercise and either can't go running or can't leave the house can use these handles if they find a rope. The idea came from the education tab in the UNICEF Supply Catalog where under physical education they had mostly kick balls which could be expensive to replace all the time because of constant use or if it were to get lost. This provides a cheap alternative for either single use or could be used to make a big jump rope for 3+ people at a time."
