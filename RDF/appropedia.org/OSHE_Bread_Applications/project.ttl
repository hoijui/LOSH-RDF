    okh:function "BREAD (Broadly Reconfigurable and Expandable Automation Device) is a project that has been under development at Michigan Tech for the past year, and expressly aims to reduce design lead time in system-based projects. Generally speaking, the scientific community is great at making individual useful devices, but experiments combining these systems can be time consuming, design-wise. BREAD is an attempt to make any potential system design \"Plug + Play.\"   === Project Significance ===   ==== Objective ==== The overall objective of BREAD is to create a platform in which any idea one may have for a \"grander\" system can simply be achieved by combining different modules (hereby referred to as \"slices\" for thematic consistency) into the back-plane device which unites them. This project in particular aims to serve as a proof of concept for the system as a whole by implementing an already existing and well-studied system-- the 3D printer.   ==== Project Goals ==== The technical goals of this project, currently, are as follows:  Implement all hardware necessarily required to control all the base elements of a 3D printer If slices do not already exist to perform above mentioned tasks, design, implement, and test them." ;
