function = "High Temperature 3D Printer for Open Source Hardware Enterprise. The objective is to provide a low cost, open source solution for 3D-printing in high performance materials such as PEEK (polyether ether ketone), PEI (polyetherimide) and PC (polycarbonate), to increase the availability to engineers, makers and medical professionals to print in these materials.   == Background == Materials such as PEEK and PEI, have many benefits over traditional 3D-printed polymers like PLA (polylactic acid) and ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). One obvious advantage to using high performance polymers is when the final parts need to be heat resistant. PLA has a continuous use temperature of around 50℃, while PEEK can withstand temperatures up to 260℃."
