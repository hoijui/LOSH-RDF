Compared to RADAR, the lower wavelength used allows LiDAR to hold a higher standard of accuracy and precision. Many market solutions for LiDAR systems however, are complex, expensive, and proprietary. The goal of this project is to create an LiDAR system that is accessible from both a cost and complexity standpoint.
