function = "The problem our team identified is the level of difficulty in producing a large quantity of prints. More specifically, it is inefficient to require human intervention at the beginning and end of each print. If this problem were addressed, it would allow the operator to queue several prints, leave, and return to collect the completed prints.   == Objective == To develop a simple, low cost, open source solution for automating FDM printing at the hobbyist level. Automation of a consumer grade 3D printer would include configurable software to modify G-code, part removal hardware which can be installed externally to the 3D printer without modification, and a part storage solution which could accept multiple iterations of any potential design printed with the project solution."
