A big part of creating Sustainable cities needs to be working out how to co-evolve more Sustainable transport systems. This project is motivated to try and support and better understand the potential for civil society groups to use computer Geographic Information Systems (GISs) and modelling software for Transport Informatics to imagine, develop and communicate alternative paths forward for transport systems in their city-regions. See Open Source Transport Informatics tools for a developing knowledge-base about these tools.
