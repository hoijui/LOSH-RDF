We hope to use this page to share what knowledge our projects have discovered.   == Projects ==   == Updates == Below you will find the deadlines for required updates for 2009-2010.   ==== First written update ==== (due week of 3/29 - 4/2) Should include overall project timeline, milestones achieved, milestones remaining (+ target dates), list of items on which money has been spent so far, total amount of money spent. Probably less than a page." ;
