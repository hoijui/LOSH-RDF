function = "Individuals with missing legs from above the knee are in need of prosthetic knee joints. These artificial knee joints can be difficult to obtain in developing countries because of their complex manufacturing process. Local manufacturing with locally available materials would mitigate the cost and increase availability of these essential parts in developing countries.   == Detailed description of the solution == Using molded thermoplastic composites, the OTRC Knee is a durable, lightweight and inexpensive knee joint. The standard modular design makes manufacturing in developing countries feasible and affordable, increasing availability for people needing a transfemoral (across the femur) fitting."
