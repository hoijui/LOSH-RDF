Maximum humidity for operation is 80% (at 25°C) When annealing polymers always put a metal drip pan underneath your sample.   == Setting temperature == The temperature dial ranges from 1 to 10; corresponding to temperatures 40°C to 200°C. The uncertainty here may be as high as ±10°C. Insert a type K thermocouple through the hole on top of the unit for an accurate reading."
