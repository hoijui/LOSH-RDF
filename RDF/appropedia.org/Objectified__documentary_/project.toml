function = "The documentary film ObjectifiedW is all about how we, in the past decades, have 'objectified' our lives. It's about what genuinely good design includes, for example: good design is aesthetic design, good design will make a product understandable and good design is long-lived. Though my personal favorite is: \"Good design is as little design as possible.\" Actually the documentary is about a lot of stuff regarding design and products, anyone can understand the concepts that are being explored and if you have a small interest for products and design it's highly recommended.   == Underlying message == At one point the narrator was telling how people always want something different from what they have. Then a designer came up telling that we don't want our three-year-old phones anymore; in fact, we would be most pleased if we had five new phones within these three years."
