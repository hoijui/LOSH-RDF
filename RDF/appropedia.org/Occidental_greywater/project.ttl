    okh:function "Greywater treatment system made from 55 gallon drums. This is, essentially, a five stage, activated sludge greywater system. The greywater is biologically processed to be recycled for decorative landscaping. Rather than writing a general \"how-to\" for this type of greywater system, I'll start with a \"this is what I did\" type of article.   == Assess the clients needs == This client lives in a high drought area of Northern California whose well runs dry during the summer months of the year." ;
