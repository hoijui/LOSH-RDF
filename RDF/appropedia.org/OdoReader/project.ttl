    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Waterborne diarrheal diseases account for a majority of illness and deaths in developing countries, especially among children. The lack of efficient, accurate, and inexpensive diagnostic technologies to effectively control the spread of such infectious diseases poses a serious threat to the health of populations.   == Detailed description of the solution == The OdoReader is a battery-powered, cost-effective device that accurately diagnoses gastrointestinal diseases by analyzing volatile gases released from diarrheal stool samples. Odors captured by the device are blown over an internal sensor and processed by neural networks to display diagnoses and relevant treatment options. Initially designed to detect Clostridium difficile, the OdoReader is being further developed to detect other types of bacteria as well." ;
