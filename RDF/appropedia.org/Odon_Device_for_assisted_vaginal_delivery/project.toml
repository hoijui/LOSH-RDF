function = "== Problem being addressed == Complications due to prolonged second stage of labor include potentially fatal maternal (hemorrhage, infection) and newborn complications (birth asphyxia and trauma), which are major sources of maternal and neonatal morbidity. In settings with limited surgical capacities and human resource constraints, a low-cost, simple and non-surgical means of assisting with labor may save the lives of many mothers and infants.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Odon Device is made of film-like polyethylene material and may be potentially safer and easier to apply than forceps and vacuum extractor (contraindicated in cases of HIV infection) for assisted deliveries, and a safe alternative to some Caesarean sections in settings with limited surgical capacity and human resource constraints. The five steps of its use can be found here.   == Designed by == Designed by Mr Jorge Od√≥n."
