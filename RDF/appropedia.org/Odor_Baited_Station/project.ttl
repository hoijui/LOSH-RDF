    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Although malaria rates have declined greatly in recent years with the increased use of products such as nets, insecticides, and rapid diagnostic tests, malaria transmission outside of the home remains a prominent issue. There is a need, especially in developing sub-Saharan African nations where the disease remains a leading cause of death, to address transmission outside of the home in order to produce the most comprehensive and effective reduction of malaria rates.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device is a trap that lures mosquitoes either with the odor of dirty socks or a synthetic attractant made from a combination of acids, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and other components of the human body that simulate the smell of dirty socks. The traps spray the foot odor with fans that run on solar-powered batteries. Lured mosquitoes are then exposed to chemical or fungal agents that kill them anytime between 24 hours and five days." ;
