    okh:function "Rainwater catchment is a method of capturing and storing rainwater in a tank for later use. This catchment system is designed and constructed for Old Growth Cellars in Freshwater, CA. This system will collect water off of a 482 square foot roof and store it in a 1,550 gallon tank. The harvested rainwater will be used to supplement the existing 300-foot well, which is the primary water source. The rainwater will be used to wash equipment used in the winemaking process, soak barrels in preparation for wine storage/aging, and some garden irrigation. If you use this site as a reference for a rainwater catchment system, please tell us in the discussion tab." ;
