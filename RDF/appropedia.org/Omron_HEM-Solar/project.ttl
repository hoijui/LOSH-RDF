    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) continues to be a large problem globally. Blood pressure monitoring, however has changed little since it was first developed roughly a century ago. The traditional mercury sphygmomanometer is being phased out of use because of the toxicity of mercury. This has led to more widespread use of oscillometric, semi-automatic devices. Semi-automatic devices, however, still traditionally rely on batteries or an electrical connection in order to operate." ;
