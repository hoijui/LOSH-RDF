    okh:function "Open-source, self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) have radically reduced the costs of three-dimensional (3D) printing while expanding its access. Three-dimensional printing's model of distributed manufacturing can produce medical technologies at significantly reduced costs. We investigate this potential by evaluating the viability of an open-source 3D printable infant clubfoot brace. Materials and Methods Starting with a list of key features present in currently available clubfoot braces, a 3D-printed clubfoot brace was developed in free and open-source CAD software (FreeCAD) to enable future customization. Polylactic acid, a biodegradable and recyclable bioplastic, was selected among the various commercial 3D printable materials based on strength and cost." ;
