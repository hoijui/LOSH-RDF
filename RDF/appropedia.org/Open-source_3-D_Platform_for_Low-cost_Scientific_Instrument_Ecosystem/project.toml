function = "The combination of open-source software and hardware provide technically feasible methods to create low-cost, highly-customized scientific research equipment. Open-source 3-D printers have proven useful for fabricating scientific tools. Here the capabilities of an open-source 3-D printer are expanded to become a highly-flexible scientific platform. An automated low-cost 3-D motion control platform is presented having the capacity to perform scientific applications including: i) 3-D printing of scientific hardware, ii) laboratory auto-stirring, measuring and probing, iii) automated fluid handling and iv) shaking and mixing. The open-source 3-D platform not only facilities routine research while radically reducing the cost, but it also inspires the creation of a diverse array of custom instruments that can be shared and replicated digitally throughout the world to drive down the cost of research and education further."
