function = "This project is part of a collection on open source optics meant to radically reduce the cost of experimental optical equipment. The fiber optic cable holder consists of three components: the metal rod, the plastic base, and the fiber optic cable holder. The metal rod fits through the holder and the holder is held in place with a set screw. The fiber optic cable is placed within the holder is held in place with another set screw. The fiber optic cable is the Ocean Optics QP600-2-VIS-NIR. The wide plastic base gives the whole setup stability and flexible placement."
