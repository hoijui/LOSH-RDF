function = "Ecuador has an opportunity to radically reduce the cost of experimental research in the sciences while improving scientific tools by implementing five policies to support open-source hardware for science. Exorbitant prices of primarily imported scientific equipment limit scientific access in both education and research. Historically, the scientific community had no choice â€“ forced to buy proprietary tools to participate in state-of-the-art research (high monetary cost) or develop everything from scratch (high time cost). Now the combination of open-source microcontrollers and 3D printers enables the fabrication of customized, low-cost scientific equipment with far less time investment.1 For example, open-source colorimeters can be built to do COD measurements for under $50 replacing similar hand-held tools that cost over $20002 or single automated devices used in solar energy labs such as a filter wheel can be built in a day for $50 replacing inferior commercial tools that cost $2,500.3 Even high-end equipment can be built from open-source plans such as an $800 open-source microscope that replaces a $80,000 conventional microscope.4 This method not only offers the potential to radically reduce the cost of doing science, but also training future scientists.5 An entire university classroom of physics optics setups can be printed in house for $500 on a $500 open-source 3D printer replacing $15,000 of commercial equipment6, which would save over $400,000 if scaled only to the basic physics labs in the 29 public universities in Ecuador. To fully take advantage of this opportunity Ecuador must implement policies that allow knowledge to scale horizontally."
