function = "This project is part of a collection on open source optics meant to radically reduce the cost of experimental optical equipment. This is a lab jack, which is a height adjustable platform ideal for mounting optomechanical sub-assemblies, which require height adjustment. Later we can automate it with a stepper motor and an Arduino. Lab jacks cost between about $30 and several hundred. Here you can make a customized lab jack for your applications for a few dollars."
