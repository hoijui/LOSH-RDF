function = "This project is part of a collection on open source optics meant to radically reduce the cost of experimental optical equipment. This open source lens holder is designed to hold a 1 inch diameter lens and is comparable but more flexible than commercial optical equipment products such as the Thor Labs Lens Holder here. The lens holder consists of three components: the metal rod, the plastic base, and the lens holder. The metal rod fits through the lens holder and the lens holder is held in place with a set screw. The lens is placed within the lens holder is held in place with another set screw."
