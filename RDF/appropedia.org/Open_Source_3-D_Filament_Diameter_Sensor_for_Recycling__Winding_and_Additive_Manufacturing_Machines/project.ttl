    okh:function "To overcome the challenge of upcycling plastic waste into 3D printing filament in the distributed recycling and additive manufacturing systems, this study designs, builds, tests and validates an open source 3D filament diameter sensor for recycling and winding machines. The modular system for multi-axis optical control of diameter of recycled 3D-printer filament makes it possible to analyze the surface structure of the processed filament, save the history of measurements along the entire length of the spool, as well as mark defective areas. The sensor is developed as an independent module and integrated into recyclebots. It was tested on different kinds of polymers, different sources of plastic and different colors including clear plastic. The results were compared with the manual measurements, and the measurements obtained with a one-dimensional digital light caliper." ;
