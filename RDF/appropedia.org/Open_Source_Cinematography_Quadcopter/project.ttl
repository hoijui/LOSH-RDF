    okh:function "The goal of this Cinematography Quadcopter is to create an open source platform that can be used for areal photography and cinematography, and provide a platform that can be adjusted or manipulated based on the objectives of the quadcopter.   == Background == The goal of this project is to create an open source quadcopter platform that is able to capture 4K resolution pictures and videos. This platform is based on previous open source hardware to control the software and electronics of the quadcopter, and the frame is designed using the open source software FreeCAD to make a 3D printed frame. This 3D printed frame and open source components makes the cost of this project minimal while maintaining a reliable and customizable platform. The quadcopter also contains features to make it weather resistant in order to increase its longevity." ;
