    okh:function "Monochromators are used in optics to isolate certain wavelengths from a light source made up of many wavelengths. Monochromators on the market are anywhere from $2000 to $10,000. Our monochromator is made for less than $100.   == Project goals == The goal for this project was to create an easily 3D printed and assembled monochromator that is still relatively accurate.   == Design ==  	Monochromator Parts 		 		 		 		 		 		   === Mechanical Assembly Instructions === Purchase mirrors, bolts, nuts, razor blades, stepper motor, and associated electronics Print files from NIH site http://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-002158 Epoxy mirrors into printed mirror holders and leave until dry Cut 1\" by 1\" square from edge of DVD-R and epoxy to mirror holder face Epoxy 16mm M3 bolt onto end of stepper motor Push M3 nuts into pockets on back of front wall Bolt razor blades onto wall with sharp edge pointed into center of wall Bolt stepper motor to wall using 4 bolts, with 2 washers under each bolt Bolt wall to base with 2 M3 bolts Push first mirror holder into square slot on base pointed toward front wall and insert bolt from underneath to secure, repeat with second mirror holder Push M3 nut into pin for diffraction grating mount Place pin into arms on diffraction grating mount Place diffraction grating mount into hole on base plate Rotate pin so that the nut side is closest to the stepper motor and rotate the motor by hand to start the bolt into the nut Place assembly into cardboard box, mark out holes for motor and slots Remove assembly, cut out holes, place assembly back in box Tape assembly to bottom and front of box being careful to not cover inlet and outlet slots with tape Proceed to electrical setup section   === Electrical Assembly Instructions / Software === Wire stepper motor according to this diagram Program Arduino according to the code below: #include <Stepper.h>  const int stepsPerRevolution = 200; // change this to fit the number of steps per revolution // for your motor  // initialize the stepper library on pins 8 through 11: //Stepper myStepper(stepsPerRevolution, 4, 5);  int stepCount = 0; // number of steps the motor has taken  void setup() { pinMode(6,OUTPUT); // Enable pinMode(5,OUTPUT); // Step pinMode(4,OUTPUT); // Dir  // initialize the serial port: Serial.begin(9600); }  void loop() { // step one step: Serial.println(\"Please Enter Step Value (-50 to 50): \"); while (Serial.available() == 0); int val = Serial.parseInt(); //read int or parseFloat for ..float..." ;
