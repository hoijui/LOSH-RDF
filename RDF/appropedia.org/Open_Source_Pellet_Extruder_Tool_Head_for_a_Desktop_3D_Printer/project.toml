function = "To create an open source pellet extruder for an open source desktop 3D Printer.   == Background ==   == Problem Statement ==   == Project Significance == This tool head once complete will be the first Lulzbot compatible FPF-style extruder assembly. Project Goals:  Design a tool head that can be used on a Lulzbot Taz 6 Design uses components found on a standard Taz 6 tool head Cost of toolhead less than $400 Future Goals:  Tool head design adopted to other open source desktop 3D Printers   == Bill of Materials == This project is still in development and the final bill of materials has not been finalized."
