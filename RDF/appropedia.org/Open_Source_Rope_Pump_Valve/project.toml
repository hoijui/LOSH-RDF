function = "Rope pumps are an incredibly easy and cost effective way of raising water to the surface. The main hindrance is the valves that go on the rope. the previous versions were made from tire sidewalls and metal washers or small scale injection molded pieces that produce a part of with many complicated tools and a large energy consumption. This open scad design fixes this dilemma.
