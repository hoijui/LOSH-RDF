function = "This project was first designed to upgrade a salt spray chamber on Michigan Technological Universities campus. The project has been expanded to convert all designs of the salt spay chamber to open source design.   == Project goals == Plan upgrades Execute Upgrades Make BOM and instructions for entire chamber Profit   == Design == All design files are hosted on http://3dprint.nih.gov The links for each file are listed below.   == Costs == This table shows the cost savings for the current modifications to the chamber.   == Conclusions == This salt spray chamber would save approximately $19,000 from our first rough estimates."
