    okh:function "This is a biodigester built using commonly available IBC containers  		 		 		 		   == Why IBC? == This is a biodigester and gas capture system that can be easily built by amateurs using commonly available components  Low cost Standard size for comparing experimental data Open Source design   == History == Thomas Culhane designed and innovated this HDPE Plastic IDB Tote 3-tank water-displacement pressurized biogas system in Cairo, Egypt and built the first one working with Solar CITIES associates Hanna Fathy and Mike Rimoin and students from the SEKEM Environmental Science Center in October 2009 after many experiments on his own porch in Essen Germany. After building many ARTI India style telescoping biogas digestors in Cairo Egypt throughout the previous year Culhane realized several improvements were necessary for spreading the technology out of the East and Middle East to colder climates. In 2013 Thomas decided to make the design explicitly 'Open Source'   == Project goals == Encourage others to build IBC biodigesters Collect and share data about real world performance Innovate Iterate new designs   == Design == The initial design has been documented here Until all details are documented here it's worth using this link as a reference.  The design details will be copied here to; Improve awareness of the design & ensure the design remains available through Appropedia   == Parts list & Costs ==   == Additional Components ==   === Bicycle powered food grinder ===   === HS2 Scrubber === Hydrogen Sulphide, or 'Rotten Egg' gas, will combine with the moisture in the biogas to form sulphurous acids and these can corrode almost anything." ;
