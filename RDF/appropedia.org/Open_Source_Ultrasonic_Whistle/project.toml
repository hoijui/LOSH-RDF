function = "Wolves are a problem with reindeer husbandry. This 3D-printed ultrasonic whistle is a cheap method to be used as a wolf preventative. As problems grow worse, this solution loses it's use; however, as an initial preventative the whistle can provide some warding effects. Wolves have a much higher range of hearing than humans. Humans hearing peaks at about 20kHz, while most dogs can hear up to 54kHz."
