    okh:function "The Microfarm is the other key feature of the Open Home that helps it function as an engine of self-sufficiency. A Microfarm is a small integrated farming complex that uses urban and vertical farming techniques and hydroponics/aquaponics technology to optimize productivity in as small a space as possible. There will be many sophisticated features to the complex, particularly as we wish this project to showcase many novel and cutting-edge concepts. But the chief features will be a greenhouse housing an open source vertical growing aquaponics system akin to ZipGrow and containerized sub-irrigation planters for large plants and Living Machine waste handling. Not strictly functional, the Microfarm will also include living wall/farming wall systems as a decorative architectural feature." ;
