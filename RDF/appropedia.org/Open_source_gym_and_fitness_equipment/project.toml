function = "== Project goals == It is frequent to see how in most gyms around the world how most brands of the equipment that you can find have brands from far away countries. It is sad to think how much CO2 has been wasted transporting those machines from a centralized and far point to the final gym location. This article aims to bring localization and self-management of the production of these machines by open sourcing/freeing the schematics of many types of machines seen at the gyms. Feel free to collaborate with the article by creating the schematics code using free CAD software like LibreCad for example. If you use private applications such SketchUP or AutoCAD, please share the files with an open source format that is compatible with any open source CAD editor."
