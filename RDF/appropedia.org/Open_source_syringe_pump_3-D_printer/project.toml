function = "3D printers have come a long way. This project hopes to push the field of 3D printing into even greater endeavors. This printer moves away from using solid material deposition and towards a liquid material(effectively printing with inks). The goal of this type of deposition is to create ultrathin film materials to be used as coatings or in layered objects.   == How to Operate == The following directions provide a step by step process for the use of a syringe pump attachment."
