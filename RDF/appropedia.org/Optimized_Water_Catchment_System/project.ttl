    okh:function "A water catchment system is a system used to capture clean water from rainfall and direct it into a storage container. It is an easy method of obtaining potable water and storing it for future use. One of the requirements of a water catchment system is that they require a large exposed surface to collect water. Undoubtedly this large surface will be prone to collecting pollutants such as fecal coliforms, heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni), ammonia (NH4+), particulates, and other organic debris due to its direct exposure to the climate, heat, moisture, animals, etc. As the whole purpose of these RRCS's is to deliver potable water to developing communities, it is crucial to reduce the level of these pollutants in the water before it is put into storage." ;
