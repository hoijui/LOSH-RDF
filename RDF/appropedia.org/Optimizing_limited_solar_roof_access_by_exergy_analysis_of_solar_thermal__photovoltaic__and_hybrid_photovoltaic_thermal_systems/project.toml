function = "When trying to decide what type of renewable energy makes the most sense for a given application - thermodynamics should be our guide. Specifically, exergy is the energy that is available to be used - the useful energy and should be the figure of merit. In this paper we compare three types of solar energy systems using exergy to draw some generalizable conclusions for solar in the U.S.   == Source == M.J.M. Pathak, P.G. Sanders, J. M.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.041 Open access   == Abstract == An exergy analysis was performed to compare a conventional (1) two-panel photovoltaic solar thermal hybrid (PVT x2) system, (2) side by side photovoltaic and solar thermal (PV + T) system, (3) two module photovoltaic (PV) system and (4) a two-panel solar thermal (T x2) system with identical absorber areas to determine the superior technical solar energy systems for applications with a limited roof area."
