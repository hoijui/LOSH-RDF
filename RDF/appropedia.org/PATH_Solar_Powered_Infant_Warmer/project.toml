function = "== Problem being addressed == There is an estimated 3,100 newborn deaths worldwide each day within the first 24 hours of birth. This number could be dramatically lowered if breastfeeding and warmth to the child were provided immediately. Without this treatment, infants are susceptible to hypothermia and potentially, death.   == Detailed description of the solution == This affordable infant warmer harnesses solar power from lightweight, high-efficiency photovoltaic modules and uses phase change material to store the heat. It has a low-cost temperature monitoring system to ensure infant safety."
