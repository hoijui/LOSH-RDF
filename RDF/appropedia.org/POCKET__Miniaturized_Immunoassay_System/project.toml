function = "== Problem being addressed == Early detection of HIV can help to effectively control the spread of the virus. Existing diagnostic systems, especially enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (aka ELISA), are bulky, expensive, and require electricity, lengthy incubation periods, and multiple pipetting stages. The POCKET combines the immunoassay unit and the detector unit into a portable and cost-effective model.   == Detailed description of the solution == A blood sample is delivered to each channel of the device and is analyzed by an antibody-detecting strip. Protein fragments on the strip bind HIV antibodies."
