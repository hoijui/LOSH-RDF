function = "University of Kashan introduced this project and Seyyed Ali Sadat was the senior researcher in this work.   == Project goals == Studying the effect of dust on PV solar modules in Kashan desert environment Evaluation of the effectiveness of PV power plants construction in the Kashan region Prepare some data for University of Kashan Identify main barriers to development of PV energy in Iran Prepare practical solutions to overcome barriers in the context of PV development in Iran   == Results ==   === The experimental analysis of dust deposition effect on solar photovoltaic panels in Iran's desert environment === Since soiling is a site-specific problem, this paper for the first time performs controlled experiments to determine the characteristics of a dust sample from the desert region of Iran and its impact on the power efficiency of solar photovoltaic modules. Dust characterization experiments are performed using scanning electron microscope, X-ray fluorescence, and elemental mapping. Elemental mapping tests, which have attracted little attention in photovoltaic soiling studies, will help researchers to investigate this phenomenon more accurately. For electrical evaluations, general relationships between losses caused by dust deposition and degradation of photovoltaic output parameters are obtained by testing different dust samples."
