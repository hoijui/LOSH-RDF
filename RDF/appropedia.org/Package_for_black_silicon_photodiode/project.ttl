    okh:function "The goal of this project is to design a similar photodiode package that could be fabricated with a 3D printer and thus avoiding the huge tool costs. A fully parametrized OpenSCAD code is designed which allows easy fabrication of packages for any sized photodiodes and windows. Silicon photodiodes are very sensitive devices that can be used to measure light with various wavelengths. However, the bare silicon chips are prone to damage and dirt that can affect their sensitivity. Additionally, connecting the chips to external circuits is often not directly possible." ;
