function = "Cotton is historically one of Pakistan's top cash crops, along with oil seeds and fruit. [1] Pakistan's economy is reliant on the cotton industry, which accounts for 11 percent of GDP and 60 percent of total exports. [2] It is the fourth-largest producer of cotton in the world. [3] More recently, cotton production in Pakistan has struggled due to pests. The typical solution has been increasing pesticide use, from 665 tons used in 1980 to 45,000 tons used today."
