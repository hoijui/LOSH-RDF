    okh:function "A Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is a \"cradle to grave\" analysis of a product. It is a way of looking at the total effects on the environment of a product. This assessment usually investigates the energy, materials, and water requirements; and the amount of solid waste generated and pollution that is emitted to the surrounding air and water. An LCA includes the effects of a product on the environment during operation as well as when the product is no longer being used. Often the indirect effects of the product could be evaluated beyond the possible scope of an analysis." ;
