function = "We have researched and compared papercrete and straw bale as alternatives to the most common types of building material based on criteria such as r-value, cost of production and pollution concerns. The purpose is to see how appropriate these materials are for application depending on location and personal choice.   == Background ==  Even though we might be accustomed to only a few different types of building materials in the United States, there are many alternatives to the typical wood and sheet rock or redbrick buildings. Some alternatives are more \"environmentally friendly\" than others and better suited to certain locations but by what factors can these decisions be made? How can they be compared?"
