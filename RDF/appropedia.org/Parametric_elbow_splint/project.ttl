    okh:function "Arm injuries are a very common occurrence, especially with children and younger adults that are working in manual labor. In order to heal the injured elbow, an elbow splint is used and these tend to vary in price -starting from $16.59 [1] all the way up to $639.44 [2]. A fully parametric elbow splint design was then prepared to make the healing process more affordable.   == Bill of Materials == The openSCAD code that is provided on Thingiverse, link is here [3] Epoxy Bracing Material -this could be anything from nylon straps to pieces of paracord.   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == All that is needed is to take the radius measurements of the elbow, the forearm, upper arm and the desired height of the splint." ;
