function = "Buckles are very useful and found on a wide variety of items; however, if one breaks, it is hard to find a cheap replacement. Since buckle sizes vary depending on the application, I made a fully parametric OpenSCAD design. There are several other buckle designs available, but none of them can be scaled easily; many of the designs found only provide STL files.   == Bill of Materials == Filament (amount depends on size of buckle) Design files (OpenSCAD and STL): | Youmagine Link   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == Knowledge of OpenSCAD is needed to manipulate the parametric settings in order to customize the buckle (such as changing the buckle width in the code to match application).   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Print Settings Male Buckle: 30% infill, 0.2mm layer height, 60mm/s print speed, print with prongs flat on bed."
