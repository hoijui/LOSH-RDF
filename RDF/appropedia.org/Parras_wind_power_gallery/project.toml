function = "=== Wind Powered Pump: Swimming Pool === Description A windmill is used to power a water pump which fills a swimming pool. At this time the home is still under construction, and the pool is being utilized as a water source for construction needs. Location Very near Estanque de Zapata, it is the closest windmill to the entrance of the underground stream. Justification In a climate such as Parras going for a dip in a pool is an effective way to cool off, adding to human health and happiness. Swimming is much more energy efficient than using an air conditioner, and by using the wind to pump the water no energy is consumed."
