    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == The partograph has proven to be the most effective labor monitoring and assessment tool, allowing individuals to accurately detect complications and address them in a timely manner. However, healthcare workers in resource-limited settings are often not trained to utilize and interpret these graphs properly.   == Detailed description of the solution == The PartoPen is a low-cost, interactive digital pen that interprets paper partographs printed with a recognizable background dot pattern. Using internal handwriting recognition and paper-based location awareness, the pen analyzes measurements made on partographs. It can trigger alerts to healthcare workers when it recognizes a need for additional observation or intervention and contains timers that serve as reminders for healthcare workers to take routine, regular patient measurements." ;
