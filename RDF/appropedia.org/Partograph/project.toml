function = "== Problem being addressed == 8% of all maternal deaths in developing countries are due to obstructed and prolonged labor. Obstructed labor can occur because of cephalopelvic disproportion, abnormal presentations of fetal anatomy and certain abnormalities of the reproductive tract.   == Detailed description of the solution == The partograph improves obstructed labor outcomes by providing obstetricians or midwives with a pictorial overview of the labor's progression, which makes early identification of an obstructed labor possible and gives them more time to manage the obstructed labor. The partograph may include measurements such as cervical dilation over time, fetal heart rate and vital signs and helps health care professionals to detect deviations from normal labor. The only costs associated with the partograph are printing and training costs."
