    okh:function "This hand powered machine is a food processing tool that will grind peanuts down so they can be made into peanut butter. There aren't many 3D printable milling devices out there. This entire mill is 3D printed and was designed with all open source technology. Food processing mills and machines are expensive to buy, so this printable one allows people in need to have tools that work.   == Bill of Materials == Fully 3D printable (I used 1.75mm PLA filament) Link to Openscad and STL Files Bearing Bottom, 4 min, 2 g Bearing Top, 7 min, 4 g Center Rod, 18 min, 11 g Connector Arm, 15 min, 8 g Funnel, 3 hr 19 min, 111 g Bracket, 5 min, 2 g Handle, 34 min, 18 g Inner Grinder, 34 min, 21 g Outer Grinder, 1 hr 27 min, 49 g TOTAL: 6 hr 39 min, 226 g   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_joining   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Directions for Assembly:  Fit center rod into internal grinder Place it in the outer grinder Put bearing top on the center rod Slide funnel on and snap pegs to outside of outer grinder Line up bearing top and bottom on funnel with center rod running through them Plastic join the bearing top and bottom Plastic join the internal grinder with the bracket Snap on connector arm to center rod Snap on handle to connector arm Print time estimate: 6 hours 39 minutes Assembly time estimate: 15 minutes Drawing of Assembly:   === Common Problems and Solutions === Plastic welding: The point of doing this in two places was to eliminate the need for screws and washers to make this completely printable." ;
