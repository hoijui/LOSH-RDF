    okh:function "As part of the Spring 2013 semester ENGR 305 Class at Humboldt State University Holly Johnston and Garrett McElroy were assigned to refurbish a bicycle-powered energy generating system for the Campus Center for Appropriate Technologies' (CCAT) Mobile Energy Operations Wagon (MEOW). Four bikes were stored inside the MEOW, three with generators attached, one without. Once upon a time, these bikes were part of the CCAT pedal concert generator. Over time they fell into disrepair. The assignment was to attach at least one, preferably three, bikes to the existing battery system within the MEOW. These batteries were only charged by solar power at the time." ;
