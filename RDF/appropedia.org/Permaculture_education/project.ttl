If you're comfortable doing a bit of research and applying plenty of trial and error then this is a great option and thanks to the Internet there are a ton of resources out there about permaculture. It's a good idea to get in touch with other local permies so join up with your local group.   == Introduction to Permaculture == This is typically a 2-day workshop combining an overview of permaculture and some hands on workshops. This is the ideal course for people new to permaculture who want a better understanding of permaculture as a whole and take away some practical skills." ;
