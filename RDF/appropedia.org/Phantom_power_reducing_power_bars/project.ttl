    okh:function "Phantom power is the power consumed by electrical appliances when they are switched off or not in use, but remain plugged in to an electrical socket. It is also known as standby power, the minimum amount of power required by an electrical device while plugged in. Although the phantom power consumption of one individual appliance may be trivial, many appliances within a home or business draw power when not in use, and this power consumption can accumulate. Another reference to phantom power is standby power or vampire power, this can be thought of as a leaky faucet and can account for a total of 10% of the energy costs for a residential home. The following articles provide a comprehensive background on phantom power, its effects, and how it can be mitigated." ;
