    okh:function "This is a parametric FreeCAD model that can be adapted to a variety of threaded or unthreaded pharmaceutical pill/medication bottles. This was requested as part of the Requests for 3-D printable open source appropriate technology#KIJENZI .2F HESE PRODUCT LIST. It would be useful to print low-quantity replacement caps, or caps for oddball bottles that don't have a stock of appropriate caps around. This would be useful in areas where it's not easy to get additional stock of caps out - rural areas, isolated research bases (McMurdo Station, Antarctica), or developing areas, all of which can have significant shipping overhead and lead time.  See YouMagine page for CAD.   == Bill of Materials == Bottle that needs cap PLA Filament (amount varies) CAD model   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Measuring tool (ruler/scale will work fine) Computer with FreeCAD installed   == Skills and knowledge needed == Ability to measure basic dimensions Ability to use FreeCAD to edit design spreadsheets and generate STL files   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Measure the bottle that needs a cap. The important dimensions are the outer diameter of the opening and the height of the mating area." ;
