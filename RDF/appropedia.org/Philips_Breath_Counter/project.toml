function = "== Problem being addressed == Infant pneumonia is one of the leading causes of fatalities in children under the age of five, claiming more than two million children's lives every year.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Breath Counter measures the number of breaths taken by a patient to diagnose pneumonia. Once an activation button is pressed, the device counts each breath taken by an infant for one minute. A total of three tests are taken, and the count results for all three tests are displayed on an LCD screen. The device is powered by solar cells and has a lifespan of more than five years."
