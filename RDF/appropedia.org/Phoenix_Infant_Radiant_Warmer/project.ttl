    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Many infants suffer complications immediately after birth due to the lack of a consistent heat source. This is especially true for low-resource settings, where the majority of children are born at home and do not have the resources to provide their newborn with the necessary care immediately after birth.   == Detailed description of the solution == The infant radiant warmer is a mobile, battery powered device that addresses severe heat loss suffered by some infants by allowing the infant’s bed to be uniformly heated. This is done by infrared radiation (IR) from a quartz heater that is beamed by a parabolic reflector uniformly over an infant’s bed. The device has a sensitive thermostat that does not require calibration to use it." ;
