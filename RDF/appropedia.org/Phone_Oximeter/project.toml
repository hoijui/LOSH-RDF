function = "== Problem being addressed == Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and infant mortality. Although medical equipment exists that can detect high blood pressure during the early stages of pregnancy, many women in resource-limited settings do not have access to equipment that could help detect the onset of pre-eclampsia.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device integrates pulse oximetry, a method which shoots light waves through a patient’s finger to determine blood oxygen levels, with software that can be downloaded into a cell phone. By using these mechanisms, this device can track the mother’s oxygen levels, a critical measure for accurately predicting pre-eclampsia. By combining these two mechanisms, this mobile pre-eclampsia risk assessment device can overcome barriers found in low resource settings such as a lack of skilled medical workers and minimal accessible medical facilities."
