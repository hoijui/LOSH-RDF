In addition, the global supply of fossil fuels is limited and concentrated such that obtaining fuel is the source of many economic and political problems. Moreover, with only 5 percent of the world's population, Americans consume 26 percent of the world's energy. Yet we are the nation that is most able to affort investment in clean alternatives."
