function = "The goal is to construct a piezoelectric energy harvesting device that can generate enough energy to create a noticeable charge in a battery.   == Design == Eight piezoelectric transducer pads were placed under the sole of a shoe and connected to a battery pack. A diode was soldered to each piezo pad, and a rectifier was soldered to the system, before it was connected to the battery.   == Results and Discussion == Before testing batteries I drained them with a Mini Maglight bulb. After wearing the shoes with 2 NiCd AAA batteries for half a day the batteries would not light an LED, and they only lit the Mini Maglight bulb for a fraction of a second."
