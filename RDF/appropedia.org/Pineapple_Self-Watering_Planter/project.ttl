    okh:function "Big Money Project. This is a pineapple self-watering planter remixed with FreeCAD. It was taken from an original pineapple planter created by DasMia (Cults3D Link) and remixed into a self-watering planter. The top piece has a hole in the bottom for 100% cotton to be thread through to carry water from the bottom water void. This enables the water to take advantage of the capillary effect and self-water your plant. Link to part on myminifactory: Self-Watering Planter on myminifactory Link to part: Pineapple Self-Watering Planter on Thingyverse *Note* This had to be put on Thingyverse because myminifactory does not accept freeCAD models and the file was too large for libre3D.   == Cost savings == Commercial Equivalent - $18.99 - Wayfair Pineapple Planter *Note* Commercial Equivalent is not a self-watering planter." ;
