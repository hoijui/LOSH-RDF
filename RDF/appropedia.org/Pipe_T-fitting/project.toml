function = "Accessing clean water is still a struggle for many people throughout the world. In areas devastated by natural disasters, it can take years for the infrastructure to be rebuilt. Makeshift water piping has been a massive undertaking in Nepal especially where an earthquake devastated the area a year ago. Organizations such as Field Ready are hard at work making sure water supply systems in the area are sanitary and helpful for those who need it. The T-fitting module was specifically requested by Field Ready to join hoses in the field to allow for more pipes to be ran while the entire system staying sanitary."
