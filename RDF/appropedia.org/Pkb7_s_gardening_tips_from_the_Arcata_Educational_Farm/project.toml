function = "The following information is a demonstration of personal experience gained from two years of working at the Arcata Educational Farm. The Arcata Educational Farm has existed as a non-profit organization for the past 15 years with a fully functional CSA which doubles in providing the community with a direct educational experience in small scale vegetable production. Bayside Park is located at 930 Old Arcata Rd. Arcata, CA 95521. My experiences over the last two growing seasons related to small scale community agriculture have taught me many important lessons pertaining to vegetable production in coastal northern California."
