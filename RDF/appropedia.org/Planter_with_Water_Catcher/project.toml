function = "This is a planter with a water collection point. This removable cup allows for the easy collection of water to reuse for whatever is planted in this planter. This also has the modular capabilities to connect with another print of itself with the hook printed onto it, making sure it is good to use for space given to it.   == Bill of Materials == This design used 1.53 grams of filament, which equaled a cost of $4.59 for the filament that was used in this project. Here is a Thingiverse link for the files for this project."
