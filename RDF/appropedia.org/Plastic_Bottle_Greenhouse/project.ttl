    okh:function "4 x 2 ft greenhouse structure using recycled 500 mL bottles that I collected from a local recycling center.   == Materials == 500 mL plastic bottles Wood 2 inch wood screws Saran wrap Duct tape Soldering iron String Drill   == Procedure == Construct each side of the green house individually Use a soldering iron to melt a hole at the bottom of the bottle Put string through bottles and tape ends on the wood, continue this step until rows completely fill each side (on the 4x2 sides there should be 54 bottles aligned, on the 2x2 side there should be 27 bottles) Saran wrap a few layers on each side, make sure there are no openings Screw the structure all together   == Understanding the market == I researched some plastic bottle greenhouses and many people used 2 liter bottles, cut the bottom of the bottles and stack them. Or they would put wood rods through the bottles and line them up.   == Project goals == Have a door hinge for the top part of my greenhouse creating easy access to plants. Grow fruits and vegetables!" ;
