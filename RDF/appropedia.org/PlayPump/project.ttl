    okh:function "The PlayPump is intended to give children in South Africa a place to play and simultaneously provides their community with a much needed sustainable water source. The concept is that rather than blood, sweat, and tears being shed to obtain water for survival, the simplicity of kids play equipment brings water to the community. In practice, the high cost expense, required effort and relative difficulty of maintenance make the device impractical. The vision: Children spin on a merry-go-round that powers a pump. Water is pumped out of the ground and into a tank for the community." ;
