Technical sheet Soil type: any type of soil but ideal for heavy soil medium, which is not too stony Traction: a pair of oxen Stability: longitudinal Coulter: duck beak-type, width 8 \" Versoir: cylindrical type Use: for small sized holdings (<4 ha) or in addition to more heavy machinery in larger establishments Features:: locally produced, low manufacturing cost, simple manufacturing techniques.   == Introduction ==  This guide is intended for all workshops that wish to commence the manufacturing of an animal-drawn plough, adapted to the needs of small sized holdings (<4 hectares) in non-industrialized countries. The plough described in this guide, has been developed in Haiti by the workshops-schools of Camp Perrin (AECP), which assures that it is well adapted to most countries where there is a lack of technical skills and materials, both on regards to the manufacturing and the use of- technical materials. Indeed, several thousands of ploughs were produced and sold at the Camp Perrin workshops during the past twenty years, first by Camp Perrin itself, and later by a independent craftsman."
