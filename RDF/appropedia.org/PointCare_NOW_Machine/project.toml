function = "== Problem being addressed == For people living with HIV, the presence of the virus can be detected through a CD4 cells, which are cells that fight infection. In general as HIV progresses, CD4 cells go down which is indicative of a weakening immune system. For HIV-infected patients, a CD4 count should be administered before anti-retroviral therapies begin. However, modern technology for CD4 counting is not easily accessible throughout the developing world. Current technology, such as the flow-cytometry CD4 counter, range from US$30,000â€“$150,000 which is beyond the affordability for health systems with financial constraints."
