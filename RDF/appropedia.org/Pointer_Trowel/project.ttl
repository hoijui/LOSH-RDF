    okh:function "A pointer trowel is used in masonry to fill in joints. It has an angled, pointed end that can be used to get mortar into tight spaces. This tool was designed with appropriate technology in mind. The trowel is a simple design that can be easily changed through it's FreeCAD file and it is designed to be printed without the use of support material to save plastic. Many forms of building construction require the use trowels, whether it is in adding mortar between bricks or grout between tiles." ;
