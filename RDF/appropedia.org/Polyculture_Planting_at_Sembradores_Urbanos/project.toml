function = "Polyculture is a type of gardening where various crops are planted interspersed among each other. As opposed to monoculture, polyculture mimics natures diversity providing the benefit of better pest management, provides better protection against total crop loss due to weather or disease, optimizes on garden space with different plant root depths, and allows plants to take and give different nutrients from and to the soil, which helps reduce the need for chemical fertilizer applications and reduce the amount of erosion and top soil loss. Below is a DIY project on polyculture planting at Sembradores Urbanos. This is one project is a series of urban gardening and sustainability projects at Sembradores Urbanos.   == Background == Sembradores Urbanos is a nonprofit urban agriculture demonstration center and outreach group in Mexico City started by three women living in Mexico."
