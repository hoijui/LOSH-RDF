    okh:function "Pop-Up-Farm takes a local perspective on a global challenge:  - how to live sustainable lives by bringing sustainability education into schools and the wider community, making the global into the local.  It combines thinking and action around patterns of sustainable knowledge - the basic elements of water, waste, energy, food, growing, buildings, health and wellbeing we use to demonstrate different ways people can change their lives to the mutual benefit of communities and the planet. Pop-Up-Farm is driven from the grass-roots up and connects people, ideas and challenges to make their own pattern for sustainable living. Our farms pop up in unexpected places, initiated by the schools, groups and the wider community, always practical and solution driven.  They demonstrate that many of the challenges we face are inter-connected, and once we begin to think about and understand the connections we can create new solutions." ;
