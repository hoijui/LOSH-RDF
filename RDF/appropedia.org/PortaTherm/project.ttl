    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Electric incubators are normally used to hold blood samples at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (the temperature of the human body) for 24 hours, in order to check for the growth of harmful bacteria. Portable, battery-powered models are available, but cost $1,500 to $2,500, and tend to be fragile.   == Detailed description of the solution == The incubator holds plastic balls filled with chemicals that have a melting point of about 99 degrees Fahrenheit. To fire up the incubator, people just have to leave the balls out in the sun, or heat them in hot water, until the chemical inside melts. The balls, which will remain at the heated temperature for a full day, are returned to the insulated cooler along with water tests in petri dishes." ;
