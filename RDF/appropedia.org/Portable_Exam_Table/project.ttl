    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Women have limited opportunities to see a gynecologist in rural Ghana, where access to care, health resources and personnel are scarce. In order for a physician to practice effectively, it is crucial for him/her to have an adequate examination table especially in limited-resource settings. Exams are difficult without a proper examination table.   == Detailed description of the solution == The device is a portable table designed to be carried in a backpack. The device has an adjustable trunk height and collapsible frame." ;
