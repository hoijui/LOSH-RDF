These pages were separated both to reduce loading times and to increase utility following the project, as either serves its own purpose, and may be useful as stand alone references (i.e. one for information and the other for design).   == Background == Wheelchair ramps can be roughly divided into two broad categories: permanent and portable, each with their own further sub-designations, standards and design features." ;
