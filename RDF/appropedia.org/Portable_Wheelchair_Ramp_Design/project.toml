function = "A complete force analysis of a simple plank ramp was conducted in order to determine the forces, stresses and moments acting on it. From these, a minimum thickness can be determined based on the strength properties of the material used in construction. Included with this page is an Excel sheet which may be modified and used to calculate the forces on a custom ramp (please see disclaimer, below), as well as a Word document outlining step-by-step the force analysis procedure. Note that some calculations are incomplete. Ultimately, it is hoped that by determining the stresses on a plank ramp, a functional, low cost, portable wheelchair ramp can be constructed using locally available, economical materials and a simple construction process."
