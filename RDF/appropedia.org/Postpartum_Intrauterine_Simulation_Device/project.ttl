    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Poor birth spacing can have serious health implications for both mothers and newborns. Postpartum Intrauterine Devices (PPIUD) are inserted into the uterus postpartum to prevent pregnancy and the damages of poor birth spacing. However, the training models for PPIUDs can be large, expensive, and negligent of certain uterine positions. In low-resource areas, there is also a lack of provider confidence and number of PPUID trained health workers to provide care.   == Detailed description of the solution == This new PPIUD simulation model is cheaper, more lightweight, and more realistic to the postpartum anatomy than more frequently used models." ;
