Potato ricers work by extruding cooked potato (or possibly other starch rich foods) through small holes. This creates a lighter fluffier finished product than conventional mashing. This works by trapping air along with the potato during extrusion. The design is appropriate technology because commercially available equivalents range in price from $15-$30 USD. The availability of this design to be 3D printed could help raise the quality of life in developing countries by supplying a low cost food processing device."
