    okh:function "Potawot Health Village is a non-profit organization built by the United Indian Health Services (UIHS) \"to integrate individual, community, and environmental health\". Located in Arcata, California, Potawot provides medical, dental, and mental healthcare, as well as nutritional services for the nine tribes and over 13,000 Native Americans it serves. A crucial element in the facility's environmentally-friendly design is the implementation of a photovoltaic solar system installed on roofs of the Administration and Facilities Buildings in 2007.   == History & Planning == In anticipation of utilizing solar energy, Potawot planned their building locations so they could support and facilitate an optimal array of solar panels. The utility room, which serves as the central power inversion and grid-connection center, is located in the Facilities Building whose south-facing roof supports the majority of panels." ;
