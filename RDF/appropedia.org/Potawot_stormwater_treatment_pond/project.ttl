    okh:function "As a part of a much larger storm water treatment system at Potawot, the storm water treatment pond treats 100 percent of the water that is channeled into the system. This water comes from parking lot and building runoff from storms. The water is anything but ready to be reintroduced to the ecosystem. The pond's first purpose is to filter the water in a natural way. The pond acts as a natural sponge by removing toxins without harming the environment." ;
