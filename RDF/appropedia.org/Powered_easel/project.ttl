    okh:function "The Powered Easel is designed to be used by individuals who have minimal mobility of their upper extremities. The drawing surface is moved with the use of a joystick. The joystick controls two small DC motors that in turn drive a set of power screws. Although the design was undertaken specifically for one quadriplegic, complete drawings have been released for interested groups or individuals. This design produces a cost effective solution to what would otherwise be a completely custom designed and fabricated unit." ;
