    okh:function "In Mexico, one household in four still cooks with biomass fuel. As of 2008 almost half of the humans in the world used solid fuels like traditional biomass or coal for cooking, heat, and/ or lighting. Complete combustion of these fuels includes mixing fuel with pure oxygen to simply produce CO2, H20, and energy, but outside the laboratory and in the kitchen most combustion is incomplete and byproducts include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter. All these byproducts have adverse health impacts and two million deaths a year are associated with respiratory problems from indoor cooking fires with these traditional fuels in unventilated houses. Children and women are disproportionately affected by indoor smoke, with children making up 44 percent of these deaths, while women make up 60 percent of these deaths among adults.The lack of ventilation and the incomplete combustion of the fuel creates the respiratory problems associated with these deaths.Along with respiratory problems, the indoor smoke can give families eye problems and women often have increased back pain from bending over an open fire." ;
