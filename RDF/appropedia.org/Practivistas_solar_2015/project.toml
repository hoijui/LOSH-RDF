function = "This project is a follow-up to the solar panel systems installed in La Yuca and Ghetto2Garden, in addition to the installation of a new system completed in Las Malvinas. The following page will cover system assessments, costs, and how to install a system. The background goes into the past projects, as well as problems faced by the solar team. The literature review outlines information specifically for PV solar panel systems and some information on education matters, as the solar team involved the community in the installation process. The timeline displays the daily tasks of the project followed by the budget."
