Harrison Solar Calorimetry Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering Queen’s University  Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada    == ABSTRACT == Geothermal heat pump systems are commercially available in a variety of arrangements to be used in the heating and cooling applications of buildings. A major drawback of such systems is the long term operational consequence of decreasing ground temperatures, resulting in lower system performance. In recent developments so called “hybrid-systems” have been examined to address this issue. In these systems an independent energy source, potentially solar, is used to accommodate the unbalanced annual loads that often exist under certain climatic or load conditions (Bernier, 2006). Due to the lack of experimental data, however, it is unclear how these systems vary from an optimal design." ;
