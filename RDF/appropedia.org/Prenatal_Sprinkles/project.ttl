    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Hypertensive diseases associated with preeclampsia and preterm birth associated with anemia in pregnancy are both major causes of maternal and newborn death. This is especially the case in low-resource settings since in these areas there is minimal access to emergency obstetric and neonatal care.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device provides a means of delivering microencapsulated calcium, iron, and folic acid to pregnant women in developing settings. These substances are used because anemia is prevented by the use of iron and preeclampsia is prevented by the use of calcium. In the past, it has not been possible to combine iron and calcium within one supplement because calcium has been shown to interfere with iron absorption." ;
