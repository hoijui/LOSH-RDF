    okh:function "To increase awareness of pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) as a potential source of renewable energy, an interactive device that demonstrates power generation and osmosis through a semipermeable membrane was developed by a group of students from Humboldt State University's Section of Society of Women Engineers. The lab-scale device was fabricated using a 3D printer, which constructs three-dimensional solid objects from digital models. This method of construction allows for replication of the device; requiring only the digital plans, a 3D printer, and the thermoplastic used by the printer.   == Project Objective ==  The project objective is to build a community of engineers, scientists and educators which utilizes the PRO device and contributes to the community by providing feedback and sharing their findings. SWE will help build this community by making the device available and promoting the system to aforementioned interest groups." ;
