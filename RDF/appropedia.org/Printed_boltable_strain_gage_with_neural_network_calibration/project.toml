function = "Create a method to print a flexible base for a strain gage, radically reducing the cost of structural measurements.   == Concept == Strain gages are used to measure stress and deformation of steel structures. They are accurate, costly and hard to install correctly. They are also limited to steel as they come with a plethora of inherent expectations about measured material (maximum strain, minimum strain, repeatability and so on). Also to measure such small resistance changes they are usually connected to costly lab equipment."
