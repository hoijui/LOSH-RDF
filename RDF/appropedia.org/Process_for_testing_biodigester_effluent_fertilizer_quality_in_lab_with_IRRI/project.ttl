    okh:function "Biodigesters are a technology used to help small farmers treat animal and human waste, while providing fertilizer with reduced pathogens for safer crop consumption and gas for their stove, boilers, and electricity generation. The result is a reduction in fuel wood consumption, deforestation, and air pollutants in the home. (Eaton, 2009)(Soeurn, 1994)(Natural Research Council, 1998) Though biogas utilization has been extensively studied, the fertilizer quality has not. (Eaton, 2009) Due to the plant nutrients in biol and a growing organic food movement worldwide there is increasing interest in biol as a fertilizer. (Eaton, 2009) (Kean, 2001) Our study will sample effluent from biodigesters (biol), in Mexico, from a variety of different animals and feed and test the pH, temperature, nitrogen, total ammonia (NH3 + NH4), phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and coliforms." ;
