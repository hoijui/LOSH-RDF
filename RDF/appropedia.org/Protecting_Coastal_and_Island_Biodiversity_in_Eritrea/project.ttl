    okh:function "Eritrea has been, (and to a lesser extent, continues to be), home to both domestic and foreign conflict. These conflicts have been the primary focus of the government and citizens, until recently, as the government has begun to recognize the great importance of sustainable development for the country's success as an actor in the international community. [1] In 1996, the Eritrean government joined the UN Convention of Biological Diversity, and in 1998, began working with the Global Environment Facility, a partnership fund that connects countries with international institutions that support sustainable development.   == Eritrean Coastal Marine & Island Biodiversity Project == As part of Eritrea's United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Eritrean Coastal Marine and Island Biodiversity Project (ECMIB) began in 1999. Taken from UNDP Eritrea's information site, the four main objectives of the project are:  To collect and analyze biodiversity information for use in sustainable development planning; To increase awareness of reasons and methods for sustainable development; To integrate coastal management approaches for coastal zone development, and To establish a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)." ;
