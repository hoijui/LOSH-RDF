    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Eclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder that is the second-leading cause of maternal mortality in resource-constrained settings. Early detection and treatment of pre-eclampsia, a precursor condition, can dramatically decrease this cause of maternal death. However, most existing tests for proteinuria, a marker of pre-eclampsia, are unaffordable for regular use in developing countries.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Proteinuria Self-Test for Early Detection of Pre-Eclampsia, or “proteinuria pen,” provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-read diagnostic test for pre-eclampsia that is expected to cost less than $0.01 per use. It uses felt-tip or ballpoint pens that are filled with reagents, which are used to mark a strip of paper." ;
