    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Infection is a large contributor to maternal mortality and morbidity in developing countries. Nearly one third of all maternal deaths are attributed to infection, which can easily be prevented by minor improvements in sterile child delivery practices and reduction of bacterial transmission. Additionally, improvements in the diagnosis of sepsis can help improve mortality rates as well.   == Detailed description of the solution == This sepsis identification method uses a new microarray platform that determines the type of bacteria through the use of antibiotics. The \"microarray platform is a series of microscopic spots of short DNA fragments whose sequences are specific for individual organisms.\" Prove-It is highly accurate and produces results faster than the current gold standard by 18 hours, allowing for rapid and effective treatment of the infection." ;
