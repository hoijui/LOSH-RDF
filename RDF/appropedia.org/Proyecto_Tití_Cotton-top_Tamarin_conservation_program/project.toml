function = "Proyecto Titi is the name of an environmental program centered in Colombia with a special focus on the conservation of a critically endangered primate species endemic to the country, the Cotton-top Tamarin (Saguinus oedpipus). Due mainly to destruction of forest habitat and human colonization, the population of Cotton-top Tamarins has reached devastatingly low numbers in recent years. Proyecto Titi, which was founded in 1985, aims to bring awareness to the plight of the Cotton-top Tamarin through community education programs that focus on sustainability, as well as by encouraging field research studies that would hopefully allow us to better understand these secretive primates and protect the greater Colombian ecosystem as a whole.   == A Closer Look at the Program == Proyecto Titi aims to achieve conservation goals for the Cotton-top Tamarin through various sustainable practices that benefit not only the wildlife but the fragile Colombian ecosystem as a whole. One of these is through the creation of an environmentally-friendly bag called an Eco-Mochila."
