function = "Pruning hooks are usually used to cut branches down from trees, but in Ghana pruning hooks are used to cut down cocoa pods from tall trees. The pruning hook saves time so the farmers do not have to climb the trees with machetes. This 3D printed pruning hook is meant to be attached to the end of a long wooden pole. That means the length of the pruning hook can change by switching out the attachment with different sized poles."
