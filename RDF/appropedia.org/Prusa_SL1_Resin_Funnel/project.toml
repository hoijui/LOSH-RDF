function = "The goal of this project is to make a funnel that for pouring used resin back into the bottle. There is a space for a filter to be inserted as well since there are sometimes chunks in used resin. This funnel is modeled after the funnel that came with the Prusa SL1 printer. It will be used in the OSHE lab at Michigan Tech. There is a funnel stand as well so the chance of getting resin on your hands decreases."
