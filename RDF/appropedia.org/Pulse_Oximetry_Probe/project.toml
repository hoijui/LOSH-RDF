function = "== Problem being addressed == Deficiency of iron can restrict the transport of oxygen in the blood. This can cause birth asphyxia, affecting 40-60% of children ages 6-24 months in low-resource settings. Detecting low oxygen levels in patients when it is too late can permanently impede cognitive development, cause organ failure, or even death.   == Detailed description of the solution == This durable, low-cost pulse oximetry probe is placed on a thin part of the patient’s body (fingertip, earlobe) or on the foot of an infant. It’s oximeter measures the saturation of oxygen in the blood of newborns, sick children, and mothers undergoing cesarean sections."
