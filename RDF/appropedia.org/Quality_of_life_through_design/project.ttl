    okh:function "Improving Technics, or \"The Design Imperative\" Our quality of life, both collectively and individually, is more dependent on how we use our energy than on how much of it we use. This hypothesis continues that we can better influence our quality of life through improving technics than through increasing energy consumption.   == Poor or Rich == Image: The island of Panarea Is this a picture of a \"poor\" fishing village or one of the world's most exclusive resort islands? Actually, it's both: the idyllic island of Panarea (just north of Sicily). What is it about Tuscany or the South of France?" ;
