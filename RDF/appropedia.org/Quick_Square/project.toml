function = "This quick square or carpenter's triangle is a product that can be found relatively cheap at most hardware stores. This product allows the user to make lines perpendicular or 45 degrees from an existing edge. The advantage of making this 3D printable is that it is cheaper and someone who does not have access to a hardware store may be able to obtain it if they have the capabilities to 3D print.   == Bill of Materials == This part can be fully printed and no other components are necessary. Click Here for STL and Source Code   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == None   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Place flat surface on bed and no support material will be needed."
