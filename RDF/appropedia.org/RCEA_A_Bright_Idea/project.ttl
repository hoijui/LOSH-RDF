The model will be displayed by the Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) who set forth criteria for the project.   === Maintenance and Operation Cost ===  A Bright Idea is designed to withstand daily use by customers of the RCEA. We estimate that the incandescent bulbs will need to be changed once every five years and the CFL's will need to be changed once every ten years. These times estimates were taken from the average life of the bulbs. Maintenance cost should not exceed $20 per year for parts replacement and general cleaning applications.
