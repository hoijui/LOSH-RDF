    okh:function """Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) asked the Spring 2010 Environmental Resources Engineering Intro to Design Class at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California to design educational kits. These kits provide teachers of Humboldt County the tools that are necessary to teach kindergarten through 12th grade students about climate change, renewable resources, or energy conservation. This webpage describes the project created by Team Esquared, Bust-A-Watt, which teaches fifth through eighth grade students about energy conservation  The RCEA is a Joint Powers Authority focused on implementing sustainible and renewable energy in Humboldt County. At the beginning of the Spring 2010 semester they asked the Engineering 215 class at HSU to design educational kits that teach K-12 students about these energy topics. Team E2 of the Engineering 215 class was assigned to develop a kit that teaches fifth through eighth grade students about energy conservation.
