function = "CAN YOU WorKIT (shown in Figure 1) is an educational kit, designed in the Humboldt State University Engineering 215 class, targeting students at the high school level in order to teach about conservation of energy. The kit is supplied by the Redwood Coast Energy Authority to teachers upon request.   == RCEA Educational Kits == CAN YOU WorKIT is designed to have students assemble and operate hand crank electrical generators in order to understand the connection between work and energy. Through the powering of multiple devices in conjunction with an activity worksheet, the students will observe the amount of work that goes into powering every day appliances and in turn apply their understanding towards the conservation of energy.   == Objective and Criteria == The objective of CAN YOU WorKIT is to create a fun, interactive, reusable and transportable educational kit to promote energy conservation through the Humboldt County schools."
