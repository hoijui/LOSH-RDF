function = "During the Spring semester of 2010, a group of four students (Team Energy-Caters) were assigned a twelve week long design project in the Engineering 215 Introduction to Design course at Humboldt State University. Team Energy-Caters were sponsored by their client Redwood Coast Energy Authority of Eureka, CA., and given the task to further educate local students on renewable energy in the best-fit design they felt appropriate. The objective and criteria of the design project was developed by team Energy-Caters in order to produce a teaching aid for middle school audience on renewable energy resources. The final product, Modeling Renewable Energy, was researched, constructed, and tested with the goal of being implemented in classrooms for years to come.   == Project Overview == Modeling Renewable Energy is a design consisting of a three-part lesson plan."
