    okh:function "The Seas of Change project models the process of global climate change melting polar ice caps and raising sea levels that will eventually cover cities and destroy polar bear habitat.   == Background == The Spring 2010 Engineering 215 Introduction to Design class, as part of the Environmental Resources Engineering program located at Humboldt State University and taught by Lonny Grafman, took upon a project issued by the Redwood Coast Energy Authority. this projects purpose is for engineering students to create a reusable model that can be used by teachers to teach students about either climate change, energy conservation, or renewable energy. The Seas of Change project was created by Alex Albin, Chris Coutinho, and Britlandt Abney to educate middle school students about climate change.   == Objective ==  The objective of our project is to create a model that educates a fifth through eighth grade students about the effects of and possible solutions to climate change." ;
