function = "The Rag Doll Thermal Curtain Display The objective of this project is to educate people about Energy conservation. This will be accomplished by designing an interactive demonstration displaying one or more aspects of energy conservation, for the Redwood Coast Energy Authority.   === Implementation Instructions === The Rag Doll covers the window in the back room of the RCEA. When the curtain is closed it reduces the energy loss through the window. Since the window is north facing, light from the sun will not enter directly at any time of the year. Thus, in order to achieve maximum efficiency, the curtain should be drawn whenever the weather requires the use of indoor heating and no natural light is needed."
