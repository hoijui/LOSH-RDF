function = "The Arcata Community Recycling Center (ACRC) (Figure 1) has been serving the community of Arcata, CA for the last thirty years. Mark Loughmiller, director of operations, agreed to have the ACRC participate in a light retrofit program sponsored by the Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA). A retrofit is the addition of new technology or the upgrading of older technology. In this case the RCEA hired a contractor to change the existing light fixtures, at the 9th St. and 10th St."
