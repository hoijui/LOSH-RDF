function = "Arcata Used Tire and Wheel (Figure 1) is a Mom and Pop company that will replace worn out wheels and tires with used wheels and tires. Like most other companies, it uses electricity and produces CO2 each year. \"The company had been running on light bulbs from the 1950's\" said Joe Vagle, the owner of the company. The company purchased retrofits, replacing the incandescent bulbs from the 50's.   == Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) Predictions and Collected Data for Power, Finances, and CO2 Emissions == Arcata Used Tire and Wheel purchased the retrofits for one building, the only building existing at the time of retrofits."
