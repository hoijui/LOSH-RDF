function = "Boll Weaver (Figure 1) is owned by Crystal Dobbs (Figure 2) and has been in Eureka, California for 15 years. Boll Weaver is a textiles center, offering classes and materials for felting, weaving, crocheting, knitting, dyeing and spinning looms. The building is 1,400 square feet, with a storefront space where yarn and products are displayed, and a back room where classes are held. Most of the energy demand of the business comes from the ten lights in the store front, which are on an average of six hours a day, six days a week. The two classroom lights are used only when customers wish to see the looms or when classes are taking place."
