function = "Booklegger has been one of the many shops in downtown Eureka for many years. The owner of Booklegger, Nancy Short, explained to us in her interview  that she was not happy with the lighting in her shop before the retrofits were installed. According to Nancy Short, the old lighting that was originally present was both financially wasteful and not bright enough to accommodate the customers. After Booklegger was retrofitted, Nancy Short said she was satisfied with the work that the Redwood Coast Energy Authority had done. The retrofits, including twelve new energy efficient florescent tube light bulbs, were installed in the store next to the old, inefficient lighting system."
