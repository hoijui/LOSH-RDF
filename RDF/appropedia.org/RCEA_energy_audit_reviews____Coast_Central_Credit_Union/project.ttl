    okh:function "The Coast Central Credit Union is a financial institution in Eureka and the surrounding with 19 ATMS and 11 member service branches throughout Humboldt County. The Eureka branch worked with Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) in getting light retrofits for the building, which over time saved money and CO2 emissions.   == Redwood Coast Energy Authority == The Redwood Coast Energy Authority's mission statement taken from their webpage says: \"The Redwood Coast Energy Authority's (RCEA) purpose is to develop and implement sustainable energy initiatives that reduce energy demand, increase energy efficiency, and advance the use of clean resources available in the region\". The RCEA currently has projects to reduce local businesses' energy consumption in Northern Humboldt County. In April 2008 RCEA worked with the Coast Central Credit Union and replaced 31 fluorescent bulbs in the Eureka branch." ;
