function = "Redwood Coast Energy Authority offered many local businesses an opportunity to achieve higher energy efficiency. By tracking a company's energy use through an audit, the Redwood Coast Energy Authority was able to propose achievable savings in carbon dioxide emissions, energy usage, and dollars. The Redwood Coast Energy Authority recommended to each business a particular set of retrofits that would help them to reach these savings. The Companion Animal Foundation (Figure 1) is one of many businesses that accepted the offer. The proposed retrofit consisted of replacing the buildings fluorescent lighting."
