    okh:function "In late August of 2008 Eureka Central Residence, a low income housing complex located in Eureka, CA, underwent a lighting retrofit. This retrofit was in response to an offer made by the Redwood Coast Energy Authority, or RCEA. Their offer consisted of financial support, as well as contracting the labor towards a lighting retrofit, if Eureka Central Residence would be willing to undergo the transformation. The offer was accepted and the retrofits were made. Later, in the fall of 2009, the RCEA approached the Engineering 115 class of Humboldt State University. In an attempt to determine whether their previous projected cost, energy, and Carbon Dioxide savings for Eureka Central Residence had been met by the retrofit." ;
