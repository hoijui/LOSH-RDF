    okh:function "Eureka Floor Carpet One (Figure 1) sells floor coverings and performs installments to homes and commercial businesses across Humboldt County. Eureka Floor Carpet One experiences customer visits sporadically throughout the day, sometimes several hours or just a few minutes apart, so lights must remain on constantly during business hours. With the assistance of the Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA), Eureka Floor Carpet One replaced it's old lighting system with new energy efficient lighting.  Before the lighting retrofits, Eureka Floor Carpet One experimented with motion-sensing switches to save energy. Even though Eureka Floor Carpet One was saving Kilowatt-hours, they reported replacing light bulbs more frequently." ;
