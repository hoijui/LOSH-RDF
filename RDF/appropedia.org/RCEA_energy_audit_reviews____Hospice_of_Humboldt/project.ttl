Additional information will include the effect of the retrofits on the energy bill and how much energy was actually saved compared to RECA's past estimates.   === Hospice of Humboldt === The Hospice of Humboldt, logo on left, is a place for people in their final stages of life, looking for a comfortable home in their ending years.
