function = "Thomas J McMurray, founder of McMurray's roofing company originated in Des Moines Iowa in 1919. Twenty nine years later his company expanded across the country to Eureka, California! Eureka is a very rainy place so the roofing business absolutely boomed making the McMurray company one of the main employers of the area.    The Eureka location has multiple buildings where they work with various amounts of equipment such as: power tools, computers, lights etc. The buildings that were retrofitted include: the office building, auto shop, metal shop, and the storage warehouses."
