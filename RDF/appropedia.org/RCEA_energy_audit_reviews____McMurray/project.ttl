Twenty nine years later his company expanded across the country to Eureka, California!

The Eureka location has multiple buildings where they work with various amounts of equipment such as: power tools, computers, lights etc. The buildings that were retrofitted include: the office building, auto shop, metal shop, and the storage warehouses." ;
