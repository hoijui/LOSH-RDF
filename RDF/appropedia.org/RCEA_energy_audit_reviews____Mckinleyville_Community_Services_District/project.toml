function = "The Redwood Coast Energy Authority(RCEA) worked in partnership with Pacific Gas and Electric Company(PG&E) to implement the Energy Watch 2006-2008 program. The program was designed to help a wide range of Humboldt County PG&E customers increase their energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions through reduction of power usage. One aspect of the program involved the RCEA working with local businesses to facilitate energy savings and reduce long term energy costs by replacing existing lighting fixtures with newer, more efficient alternatives. Through this program, the RCEA was able to provide the Mckinleyville Community Services District with assistance in designing a lighting retrofit project to fit their specific needs. The RCEA plan included locating an electrical contractor, providing a specific retrofit plan for the business, and helping the business take advantage of rebates offered through the Energy Watch 2006-2008 program."
