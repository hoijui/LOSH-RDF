The RREDC is a non profit government based business also known as a gap lender. This means they cannot create competition for banks and other private lending agencies, therefore any companies they loan money to would have to be denied originally by the private sector. They are also only allowed to give loans on the aspect that the money will promote the economic development of the Humboldt area."
