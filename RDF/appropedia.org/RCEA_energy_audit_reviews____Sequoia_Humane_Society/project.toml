function = "Sequoia Humane Society (Figure 1) is a non-profit animal shelter dedicated to animal welfare. In 2007 the Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) assisted the shelter in upgrading their lighting fixtures in order to reduce their energy consumption. The purpose of this page is to compare RCEA's predicted savings for the shelter to their actual savings using data aquired over a three year period.   == Retrofit ==    The Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) upgraded approximately 55 of the shelter's fluorescent bulbs and ballasts for their lighting fixtures. These upgrades were implemented in the shelter's office areas (Figure 2), as well as in some of the kennel areas (Figure 3)."
