The local thrift store is run by a staff of friendly volunteers who give their time for the benefit of the Sequoia Humane Society. Tailwaggers Thrift Shop is owned by the Sequoia Humane Society and \"100% of Tailwaggers' profits go to support the adoption, spay/neuter and education programs of the Sequoia Humane Society.\"  The Sequoia Humane Society is a nonprofit organization that promotes not only animal welfare, but also our own individual responsibility to protect and care for animals.   === Energy Audit === On September 24, 2007, Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) completed an energy audit project that involved installing 22 new linear fluorescent light tubes into existing light fixtures at Tailwaggers Thrift Shop."
