    okh:function "Tailwaggers Thrift Shop, as seen in Figure 1, is a small retail thrift store located in Eureka, California. The store sells used merchandise such as books, jewelry, men and women clothing, silverware and dishware, arts and crafts, music, furniture, antiques and collectibles. The local thrift store is run by a staff of friendly volunteers who give their time for the benefit of the Sequoia Humane Society. Tailwaggers Thrift Shop is owned by the Sequoia Humane Society and \"100% of Tailwaggers' profits go to support the adoption, spay/neuter and education programs of the Sequoia Humane Society.\"  The Sequoia Humane Society is a nonprofit organization that promotes not only animal welfare, but also our own individual responsibility to protect and care for animals.   === Energy Audit === On September 24, 2007, Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) completed an energy audit project that involved installing 22 new linear fluorescent light tubes into existing light fixtures at Tailwaggers Thrift Shop." ;
