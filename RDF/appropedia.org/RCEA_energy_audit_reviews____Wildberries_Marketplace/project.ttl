    okh:function "Wildberries Marketplace is a grocery store in Arcata, California, and has been operational for over fifteen years. In early 2008, the store had a vast majority of its lighting retrofitted with the help of the not-for-profit organization Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA) with new and more efficient CFL bulbs, saving the store energy and money.   == Overview == The mission of Wildberries Marketplace is to satisfy their customers' demands by offering a broad choice of quality products, superior service and exceptional ambiance, while contributing to the community they serve and providing enhanced job satisfaction for their workforce. This supermarket has been profitable and successful for fourteen out of the fifteen years its been around by continuously appealing to customers and the local Arcata community. For local customers, Wildberries offers both a wide array of both locally grown organic foods, as well as corporate products like Coca-Cola and Post Cereals, making it a crossover grocery store." ;
