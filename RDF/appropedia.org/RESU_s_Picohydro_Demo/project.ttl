    okh:function "Humboldt State University's Renewable Energy Student Union built a portable picohydro unit to demonstrate sustainable hydro power at a workshop they hosted at the California Student Sustainability Convergence in November 2013. They now intend to use the demo unit for future educational purposes in classrooms and at events. In Fall 2012, HSU received a grant for a Stratasys SE+ 3D Printer and the ABS plastic material it uses. This opened up a world of opportunities to inexpensively fabricate new tools and parts, and to easily repair old devices that were previously defunct. The Renewable Energy Student Union is a hands-on engineering club, whose president at the time, Camille Penny, articulated a microhydro demonstration project that would utilize the new tool with a 3D printed Pelton wheel as the turbine." ;
