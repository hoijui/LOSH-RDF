function = "For this project I made a box out papercrete for an on-campus office supply recycling service called R.O.S.E.. The goal of the project is to create a drop box out of recycled materials to be used as a receptacle on campus to increase the amount of supplies that R.O.S.E. receives and promote awareness of the organization. To build the box I spent around 10 hours creating the necessary materials and design, and another 20 hours in its construction and overall aesthetics. The finished product fulfills most of the criteria I originally laid out, but lacks slightly in the looks department. While the aesthetics are not dead-on, the result is still a strong sturdy drop box made almost exclusively of recycled materials and painted with natural paint."
