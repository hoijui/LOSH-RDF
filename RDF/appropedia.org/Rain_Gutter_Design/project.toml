function = "Rain gutters are installed on buildings to catch rain water and direct it to a specific location. The most critical use of this water is for potable rain water catchment systems. Downstream of gutter systems will not be addressed here but should be addressed before any captured water is to be consumed. This project arose from a problem that was identified in gutter catchment systems being used in Uganda. Here it was found that the NGO's installed western style rain gutters that structurally failed in the first rainy season and western style replacement parts were not available.\nrainwater catchment"
