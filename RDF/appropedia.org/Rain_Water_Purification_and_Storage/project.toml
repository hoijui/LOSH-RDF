function = "Rainwater harvesting is one of the efficient ways of utilizing rain water for household purposes. Many of the underdeveloped and developing nations in Africa and South Asia rely majorly on these harvests since many years. While many of the rain water harvesting systems are designed for non-potable purposes, the water can be purified by use of local resources like charcoal, ceramic/clay pots and cotton sleeves. These simple water purification materials are scientifically proven to provide safe drinking water. Now all it needs is a simple, robust and affordable filter unit that can serve this purpose."
