    okh:function "I have created a rain chain for gutters of houses. I have seen these used on houses before when a gutter continuously overflows and water puddles up in bad places. The rain chain directs the water down the chain from the spout and can be collected into a bucket or place where a puddle is okay to form. This is used as an alternative to a downspout. They were originally created in Japan but many home owners prefer these over downspouts because of the look." ;
