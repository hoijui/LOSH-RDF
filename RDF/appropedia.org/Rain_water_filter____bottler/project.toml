function = "This device collects rain water in a water bottle or any container that has standard bottle threads. It includes a purge container that collects the initial dirty rain water. The reason this water is dirty is due to the sediment that collects on a roof between rain cycles. Once the purge container is filled a ball floats to the top and closes of this container and the clean rain water is diverted into the water bottle.   == Bill of Materials == All compents are 3D printable but glue is needed to secure the purge main to the bottle collector and a container with standard bottle thread is need to collect clean water."
