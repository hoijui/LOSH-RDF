    okh:function "Rain catchment systems can be constructed in many areas, both to increase the regeneration of the local aquifer with rainwater and to reduce the soil erosion from rainfall. Rain catchment during wet periods can also help full fill needs during dry periods. Rainfall can be used for drinking water, but here at Pedregal it is mainly used for irrigation and use in aquaculture. This is one project in a series of soil conservation, groundwater recharge, and farming demonstration projects at Pedregal a Permaculture Demonstration Center in San Andres Huayapam, Mexico.   == Utilizing Sloped Terrain ==   === System Components of Sloped Terrain Catchment === Storm water or creek water is guided to the place by gravity flow, but rather then following its natural path, artificial basins, channels and ditches are dug so that the rainwater is diverted from its natural path and into the tank." ;
