function = "The following is a list of goals, test procedures, survey questions, equipment needed, and abstracts for testing systemwater quality in the field, the effectivness of different components in the field, and the effect of different rainwater harvesting designs. This is one test in a series of 4 different tests of rainwater, grid water, and store bought garafon drinking water quality at The Laboratory of Community Alternative Technologies at Ajusco in conjunction with Isla Urbana. Both groups are non profits in association with International Renewable Resources Institute-Mexico located in Mexico City. Isla Urbana is a group providing rainwater catchment systems around Mexico City and other areas of Mexico, Ajusco Labs is a laboratory testing center for appropriate technology projects and outcomes. Ajusco Labs will be testing rainwater quality outcomes from Isla Urbanas systems set up around Mexico City."
