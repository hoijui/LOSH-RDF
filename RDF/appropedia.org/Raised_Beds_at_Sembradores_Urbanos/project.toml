function = "Urban soils are often either paved over and not available or they are heavily contaminated. They are also often compacted, clayey, and contain a high metal content. In response to the problems faced with poor soil available in urban spaces Sembradores Urbanos has constructed raised bed gardens. This is one project in a series of urban gardening projects at Sembradores Urbanos.   == Background == Raised beds help insure that you have access to clean uncontaminated soil and they can also be a low maintenance method for composting in the place your garden will be located."
