function = "This OSAT project is the design and prototyping of a hydraulic ram pump. This pump features no motorized parts and can be left unattended for extended duration with minimal upkeep. This pump is designed to allow someone in an area with hills with a water source far away. The ram pump does have a lot of waste water compared to how much it pumps, so it is ideal to place the waste outlet into a natural occurring water source.   == Bill of Materials == Standard Pop Bottle (~$2 USD) Super Glue (~$5 USD) Knife or cutting edge to clean up print if need be 3D Printed Parts [Link to FreeCad file and STLs]   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Knife   == Skills and knowledge needed == [principle Science behind pump] No special skills or knowledge needed to assemble pump   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == [[[Media:Ram Pump Assembly.pdf|Ram Pump Assembly]]] Print time ~~18 hours Assembly time ~~30 min   === Common Problems and Solutions === To avoid trouble with assembly, use the knife to smooth the parts till they fit \"snug\"."
