function = "The Ceiba lounge at Rancho Mastatal was built using various natural building techniques, including cob, wattle and daub, earthen plaster, chorizo, taquezal, clay paint, earth bag, and a nylon web technique. It serves as an example for many of the natural building techniques used around the farm. It is also a space slightly away from the bustle of the main house where one may relax. The roofed area around the lounge will be made into a processing kitchen for making things like cheese, soda balm, stocks, soap, and homemade beer known as \"hooch\".   == Natural Building Techniques == The Ceiba lounge exemplifies many different natural building techniques."
