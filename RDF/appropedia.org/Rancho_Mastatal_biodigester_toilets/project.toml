function = "Rancho Mastatal in Costa Rica has an award winning floating drum biodigester toilet. Jose Luis Zu√±iga of Rancho Montezumo, a coffee producing ranch near Puriscal, Costa Rica, helped Rancho Mastatal with the design and construction of the biodigester. The biodigester processes human fecal waste in an anaerobic environment, and its byproducts are compost and methane. The compost deposits into the forest below the biodigester, and the methane is fed to the main house kitchen where it is used to cook food.   == Components == The table below describes the various components that make the biodigester toilet work."
