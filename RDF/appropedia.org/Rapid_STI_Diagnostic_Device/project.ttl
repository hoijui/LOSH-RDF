    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Sexually transmitted infections in pregnant mothers can lead to adverse health consequences for both the mother and child. Although early detection and treatment of STIs can reduce the likelihood of these adverse effects, diagnostic tests are normally unavailable in low-resource settings.    == Detailed description of the solution == This diagnostics device is a low-cost, front-line testing device that enables simultaneous detection of HIV and syphilis. The device uses the blood obtained from a single finger prick to determine whether HIV or syphilis is present in the blood. This testing system yields results that are just as accurate as laboratory testing." ;
