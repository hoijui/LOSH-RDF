    okh:function "One of the top reasons for road accidents that result in injuries and deaths is the dozing off of drivers. In this study eye tracking using a novel open source Internet of Things (IoT)-based system has been developed. This study evaluated three driver's eye recognition algorithms to be integrated into the open source solution to wake drivers as they begin to dose off: 1) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Haar Cascade, 2) 68 facial landmark points and 3) gaze detection in three different face positions for both day and night driving conditions as well as with and without glasses. Each combination of those factor is tested 100 times. The best algorithm is chosen based on the numbers of correct detections and then this algorithm is tested again based on light (day and night), angle of face (left, right, and center), angle of camera (left and right), and glasses (on and off) to detect both blinking and closed eyes." ;
