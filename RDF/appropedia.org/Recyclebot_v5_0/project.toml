function = "DESIGN NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL-- use instead RepRapable Recyclebot: Open source 3-D printable extruder for converting plastic to 3-D printing filament  Recyclebot V5.0 3d printer filament extruder is under development by Michigan Tech's Open Source Hardware Enterprise. Currently, the extruder operates and can extrude filament on manual mode, and thus we strive to have a fully automatic version released in early 2017. Within the automatic version, all electronics will be extremely simplified to a plug and play type incorporating an Arduino Mega with dedicated shield, and all other electronics will plug directly into an electronics box - thus simplifying construction and reducing costs. The user interface will be a clickable rotary encoder, with a 20x4 LCD display. After the remainder of the desired functionality is developed, the design and construction will be simplified."
