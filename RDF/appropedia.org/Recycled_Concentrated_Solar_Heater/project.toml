function = "As part of my high school pre-engineering class for our final assignment we had come up with a final design project. An old water heater was also donated to this class. After watching an episode of \"The Cosmos,\" in which a farm of parabolic solar concentrators were used to heat water in order to power a steam engine that irrigated water, I was inspired to recycle the old water heater and turn it into a concentrated solar water heater.    == Project goals == Recycle an old household water heater and an old school chair and turn it into a solar water heater Project steps:  Research solar heater designs Model full scale design Model and build a 3-D printed small scale prototype Test effectiveness of design based on prototype Change design based on results Build full scale solar concentrator   == Research == Before starting to design my concentrated solar water heater I researched what some other people hade made.  There were two main designs I found:  Parabolic concentrator Commercially available parabolic concentrated solar food cooker for camping DIY parabolic concentrated solar water heater Industrial parabolic concentrator farms to power steam engines (like the one I saw on \"the Cosmos\") Flat plate collector DIY flat plate solar collector  Commercially available flat plate solar collector for home use   == Design == My original plan was to cut the end off of the water heater and then cut it down its length opposite of a flat spot it had."
