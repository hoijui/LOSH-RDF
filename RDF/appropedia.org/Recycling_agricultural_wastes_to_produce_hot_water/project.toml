function = "Two composting systems which use waste biomass (such as kitchen refuse and agricultural wastes) and human wastes for heating water are described. Since they are simple and inexpensive to construct, use widely available materials, and require minimal technical expertise, they may be ideal for developing nations. When properly constructed they require minimal maintenance, are free of odors, and pose no public health hazard. One system has been constructed and has been producing hot water for household use in Oregon for 2 months. A second more simple design is proposed."
