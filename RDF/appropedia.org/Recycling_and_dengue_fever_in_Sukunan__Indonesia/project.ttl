    okh:function "Dengue fever is a serious, sometimes fatal illness, which has been increasing in recent years in Indonesia. It is spread by a type of mosquito which can breeds in very small amounts of water - including rainwater captured by litter, such as discarded plastic bags. This project has addressed this problem in a village outside Yogyakarta, Central Java, Indonesia, through an ambitious waste management and recycling program, including changing people's habits in discarding rubbish.   == Current status == Very sadly, the village was mostly destroyed in the May 2006 earthquake. Dr Iswanto is continuing to work with villages, and providing email updates to supporters in Australia." ;
