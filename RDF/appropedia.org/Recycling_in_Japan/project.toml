function = "Japan arguably has the best recycling system in the world. This is due to recent laws passed to encourage its citizens and businesses to actively participate in the recycling. In Japan 50% of all solid waste is recycled, in contrast, the U.S. only recycles 30%.   == Instigating Legislation == 60% of Japan's total municipal solid waste is containers and packaging. As a result Japan enacted The Container and Packaging Law."
