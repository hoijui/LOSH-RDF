Wind power was the most rapid growing source of usable energy from 1990-2002  in 2003, and its strong growth continues. Currently the majority of wind farms are in European countries and the United States. The global wind power capacity by the end of 2008 had reached a value of over 120.8 GW . The Wolfe Island Wind Farm, located in Ontario, Canada just finished the construction of 86 wind turbines, each with a 2,300KW rating, establishing an overall power capacity of 197.8MW for the farm."
