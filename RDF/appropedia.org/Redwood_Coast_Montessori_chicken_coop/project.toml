function = "Building a Chicken Coop to help educate students at Redwood Montessori. Redwood Coast Montessori and the Community Center of Manila have made agreements with the ENGR215 Fall 2014 class of Humboldt State University in regards to incorporate the students' class projects into the area of the Manila Community Center so that they may benefit the school and surrounding community. The Chicken Coop project's objective was to house and protect poulty that may be owned by the school. With children in mind, the coop should be easy to use and with a harsh coastal environment the school is located on, the structure must be durable.   == Background == Founded in 2005, Redwood Coast Montessori is a school located next to the Manila Sand Dunes in Arcata, CA. The first class was held in one classroom on a traditional public school campus in Eureka, CA. In June 2012, the Arcata School District approved Redwood Coast Montessori's charter application to become a K-8 independent public charter school which began on July 1, 2013."
