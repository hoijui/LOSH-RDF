function = "Building a Traverse Climbing Wall to help educate students at Redwood Montessori. The purpose of this project is to replace the current play structure at the Redwood Coast Montessori School (RCMS) and the Manila Community Center, located in Manila, CA. Redwood Coast Montessori is a school with 80 students that range from Kindergarten-Six grade.  The children's education is formed around hands on learning rather than traditional classrooms, desks, and whiteboards. The students are allowed to express their own interest in how they want to learn throughout each day.  Like regular public schools, they're allowed to go outside and play during their scheduled recess times, but unlike regular public schools, the only play structure that they have is a log."
