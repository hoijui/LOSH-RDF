function = "Redwood Coast Montessori and the Manila Community Center allowed Humboldt State University's Fall 2014 ENGR215 Introduction to Design class to implement several student-designed projects that benefited the community. The Wayfinding Entrance Garden project's main objective was to create an attractive, inviting entrance for the school that included native plants. The inclusion of edible plants was also a consideration in the design. The garden was envisioned as a place where students might be able to learn about the care of a native garden while enjoying the sights, smells and tastes of the plants.   == Background == Redwood Coast Montessori and The Manila Community center are located in a dune environment near Manila, California."
