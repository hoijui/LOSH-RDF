function = "The purpose of this project is to renovate a greenhouse located at the Redwood Coast Montessori School (RCMS) and the Manila Community Center, located in Manila, CA.   = Background = The montessori method is one that truly embodies the ethos of learning by doing. Redwood Coast Montessori places a lot of value in providing children with an environment that encourages them to follow their passions and progress at their own pace. For some, these interests may involve food, plants, and/or gardening. The greenhouse at RCMS will provide a great opportunity for children to learn about all of these things in a hands-on manner.   = Objectives and Criteria = The objective of the House of Greenery project is to transform a deteriorated greenhouse into an engaging learning environment that is suitable for use by children."
