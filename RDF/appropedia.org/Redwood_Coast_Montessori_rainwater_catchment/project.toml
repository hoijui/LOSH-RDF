function = "The purpose of this project was to design and construct a rainwater harvesting system for Redwood Coast Montessori school in an effort to inspire and educate the students and community on the subject of renewable water sources that can be used to maintain the school's ornamental garden. By designing the system based on key criteria and constraints Team RainBeaus was able to create a functionally safe system that allows the students, with moderate supervision, to access the collected water to be used for gardening. The results of our efforts can be summarized simply by stating the system works effectively and the students are able to efficiently tend to their gardens. The system will be revisited to ensure its capability to withstand the harsh elements out on the peninsula.   == Background == Redwood Coast Montessori is a school in Manila, CA that prides itself on the education of its students through non-traditional methods including: diversifying student age groups, large blocks of work time, and allowing the students the opportunity to choose how and what they will learn based on a liberal curriculum."
