It was designed in the Humboldt State University Engineering 215 Fall 2014 by the team Las Calabasas De La Revolucion.The team is comprised of Jillian Freiheit, Julia Gomez, Javier Hinojosa, and David Rivera.   == Background == The client for our project is Redwood Coast Montessori (RCM). It is a public charter school located next to the Manilla Sand Dunes in Arcata, CA. Founded in 2005, the program started out with one classroom on a traditional public school campus in Eureka, CA. In June 2012, the Arcata School District approved Redwood Coast Montessori's charter application to become a K-8 independent public charter school beginning on July 1, 2013. The Montessori style of teaching acknowledges that children in early childhood need to develop their cognitive abilities through experiences with their senses and different materials."
