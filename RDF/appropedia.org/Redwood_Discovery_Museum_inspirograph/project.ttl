The design was to be a table top spirograph system that children could use to create geometric patterns on paper that they could take home with them.   == Background == Team BlackBox is a team of four students in Lonny Grafman's Engineering Design course (ENGR 215)for the Fall 2017 semester at Humboldt State University. The team consists of Alex Cody-Prentice, Keann Kline, Aren Page and Ish Tripp. The client that Team BlackBox collaborated with is Redwood Discovery Museum, an educational, non-profit children's museum located in Eureka, California." ;
