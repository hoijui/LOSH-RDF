function = "The purpose of the Sound Garden is to demonstrate to the user the physical relationships between wavelength and sound in a safe, interactive, and understandable way. The Sound Garden satisfies the weighted criteria specified by the client for building a PVC xylophone-like musical exhibit. Designed by The Engineers That Could, The Sound Garden is a musical addition to the Redwood Discovery Museum's collection of wave-related exhibits. The design is a fun, appealing way for museum-goers of all ages learn about the physics of the sound. The Engineers designed the project for their Engineering 215 - Introduction to Design class at Humboldt State University."
