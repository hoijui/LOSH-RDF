    okh:function """The goal of this project is to increase the lighting intensity of a single light bulb by adding a reflective shield to the bulb that would direct the light downwards. This would hopefully improve the quality of lighting in households where a single bulb is the only light source. The quality of the light source itself will not be altered; as such an increase in lighting quality will be due solely to the added reflector. The comparison between reflective options was based solely on their increase in illumination intensity. The goal is to enable individual relying on bare bulb lighting to improve the quality of lighting in an expensive and efficient manner.
