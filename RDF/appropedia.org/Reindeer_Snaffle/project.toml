function = "Snaffles, or more commonly referred to bits, are the metal pieces that riders use to give commands to their mount. For this particular page, reindeer are the intended animal to be used here, however there is no reason why a correctly sized bit cannot be used by another species. This design is the first step toward a completely modular snaffle set for both horses and reindeer. Currently reindeer husbandry in rural parts of Russia and Finland use any material that they can get their hands on to create these snaffles. This project will allow for customizable bits to be created based on the temperament of the animal."
