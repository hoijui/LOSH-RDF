function = "This is a retractable cooling mechanism for the Recyclebot. Recyclebot can be a showcase example for OSAT - Open Source Appropriate Technology. It uses waste plastic from water bottles, soda bottles, Milk cans, etc., to turn into filament for 3D printers. This filament is comparable to the commercially available filament. With enough research, in the near future, it could perform equally and even exceed the performance of the commercially available filaments."
