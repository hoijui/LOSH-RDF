function = "==== Purpose ==== This literature review is meant to provide an understanding of the usefulness and properties of perovskites as a material for 3D printing solar cells. This lit review needs to be reorganized into categories related to each layer and the materials each layer could be printed with.Furthermore, a section on printing powdered materials in a solvent should be added.   === Current Design === [1] [2]  Metal contact - Aluminum Metal Hole Transporting Material - NiO np Sensitier - CH3NH3PbIx-3BrxClx Mesoscopic Layer - Al2O3 np Al2O3 gamma np - Reasoning for gamma over alpha: highly porous, potentially catalytic features - need paper citation  Electron Transporting Material - TiO2 & graphene flakes Transparent Conducting Oxide - Florine doped Tin-Oxide   ==== Direction ==== Reusing lead \"Recycling lead acid batteries into perovskite solar cells.\" Used for syringe design Open-source syringe pump 3D printer used and modified [Mendel (iteration 2)] Used for Raspberry Pi set up on prusa for franklin How to install FLIR Lepton Thermal Camera and applications on Raspberry Pi   ==== Modified parts ==== Upload images and then upload to github.
