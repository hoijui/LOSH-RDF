Technical sheet Production schedule: 250kg/h for a recommended motorization of 15CV (~ 11kW) Training: only the manual Use: business use; for small or medium communities Maintenance: lubrication of bearings, regular maintenance of engine, replacement of worn parts: drums and knives Features: low cost manufacturing, simple manufacturing techniques, robust   == Introduction == This guide is intended for all workshops wishing to put in place the manufacturing of a rice husker, adapted to the constraints of non-industrialised countries.  The rice husker described in this manual is based on a model that has proved its worth for many years; notably the Engelberg rice husker (see Annex 5). The huller is successfully produced in Haiti since 1994 by the workshops-schools of Camp Perrin (AECP). These two elements assure the huller of being well adapted to the constraints of most countries, where the technical expertise is limited, both in regards to the manufacturing as the use." ;
