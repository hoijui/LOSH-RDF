    okh:function "Robins were causing shading on the solar panel. This shading was interfering with the efficiency of the panel. This was causing extra work for the farmer, it is a long walk back to replace the battery with a fresh one from the barn where there is a 110v charger. After replacing the battery the panel had to be cleaned off as well.   == Attaching these pieces of wire made the solar panel an unattractive perch ==   == Materials List == Wire, I used steel, about 18 gauge Wire cutters or pliers   == Order of operation == First cut the wire into pieces about 8 inches long Wrap the wire around somewhere and twist it like a twist tie." ;
