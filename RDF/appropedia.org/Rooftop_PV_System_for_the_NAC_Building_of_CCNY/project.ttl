    okh:function "CCNY is a full participant in The City University of New York (CUNY) Sustainability Initiative, which is part of Mayor Bloomberg's PlaNYC for a sustainable city. CUNY has pledged to reduce carbon emissions 30% by 2017 to satisfy PlaNYC and CCNY is doing its part. CCNY has committed to implement measures that will reduce energy consumption in existing campus buildings and infrastructure. Solar energy is a renewable energy that has taken serious consideration among these measures to reduce energy consumption. A Rooftop Photovoltaic System on the North Academic Center (NAC) building was analyzed for its energy and carbon emission reduction." ;
