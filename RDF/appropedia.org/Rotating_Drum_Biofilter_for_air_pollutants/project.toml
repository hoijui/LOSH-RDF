Kim, U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) in Champaign, Ill., has received both Corps' and ERDC Researcher of the Year Awards for his design and development of an innovative biofilter that destroys hazardous air emissions. Hazardous air emissions, containing numerous hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), are created through industrial processes at Army installations. These HAPs are generally removed by activated carbon, which produces new pollutants in the form of spent carbon."
