    okh:function """The idea behind the project is relatively simple. A stand allows the back wheel of a bike to spin freely (usually used for indoor exercise) supports a bike that powers a generator. The generated energy (actually it's converted) is stored in a battery and used on electrical devices of an appropriate voltage.   == Materials == Here is a list of the items used for this project:  bicycle exercise bike stand 12v, 60amp*hour battery (deep cycle) 900 RPM DC permanent magnet generator 3 inch skateboard wheel (diameter) 12v Delco regulator blocking diode (45V, 35A) 375w inverter 15amp inline fuses (2x) Monacore analog volt gauge (0-15amp reading) 10 gauge wire (about 15 ft) scrap metal butt connectors   == Design ==  		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		 		  The first task of this project was to design a system that was appropriate in terms of price, availability, productivity and sustainability. Because I had never worked on a pedal power project, I consulted local expert Bart Orlando to help with the initial design.
