    okh:function "Even though agriculture is an integral part of rural livelihoods of communities all over the world, there are many instances when farmers in water scarce areas are unable to succeed in their agricultural ventures due to the unavailability of water at correct time in required quantities. The aim of this Technical Brief is to create awareness of a successful method of \"run off rain water harvesting\" which can be effectively used by resource poor farming households, to overcome the hardships of nature. This method has been developed over a long period of time by various institutions experts and community members, and people working with men and women who live in drought situations.   == Rainwater for agriculture ==  Rain fed agriculture is not a novel idea to drought affected areas. As a counter measure to the unpredictability of rain, communities developed various agricultural practices to suit 'low water intensive' agriculture." ;
