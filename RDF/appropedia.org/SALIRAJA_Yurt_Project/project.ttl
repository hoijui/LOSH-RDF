    okh:function "We are a group of four Environmental Science Students who constructed a shingled yurt roof by reusing old cans that would have otherwise been thrown away or recycled. This project was done for our client Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) as part of our Engineering 305 class. Our goals in creating this roof were to rescue resources from the waste stream and to create a functional roof to meet CCAT's specifications.   == Background == CCAT is the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology at Humboldt State University, in Arcata, CA. CCAT built its yurt to provide a demonstration of a sustainable housing structure. Yurts were originally built by nomadic peoples, and traditionally constructed to be mobile; this is not true of the CCAT yurt." ;
