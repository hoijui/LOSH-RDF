function = "== Background ==  SCRAP Humboldt, a division of SCRAP, is a non-profit organization that works with the community to reuse waste material in ways that are creative and environmentally sustainable. They are currently opening a new workshop \"Maker-Space\" in the Arcata area that will be used to produce up-cycled art projects for the community. These projects will range from small to very large in physical size, and having a proper place to work on them is critical. The Community Tinker Desk is a perfect solution to this dilemma.   == Objective == Our team's objective was to create the most appealing workbench possible with limited funds."
