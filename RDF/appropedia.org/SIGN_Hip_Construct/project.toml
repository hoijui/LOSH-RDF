function = "[[[File:Hipconstruct.jpg|thumb]]   == Problem being addressed == Due to the aging population and the increasing incidence of osteoporosis, hip fractures are becoming a common problem globally.  Specifically in low-income countries, hip fractures are problematic because surgical intervention is rare.   == Detailed description of the solution == The SIGN Hip Construct is a hip bone implant made of a compression screw and a plate that holds the structure in place while the fractured bone heals.   == Relevance to developing country settings == This device was originally designed for use in Cambodia and Myanmar. Clinical trials were conducted in several countries including Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Myanmar."
