    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == In developing countries, it is  challenging to identify women at risk of preterm labor and provide early treatment.  As a consequence, preterm birth affects at least 1 in 10 babies globally and is a leading cause of infant mortality.  Thus it is important to find a means to monitor early changes in the cervix such as collagen and water levels prior to childbirth.   == Detailed description of the solution == The SMART Diaphragm monitors cervical collagen levels and wirelessly transmits information on low collagen levels to physicians. This early identification of at-risk women in remote areas can enable more rapid routing of patients to secondary health facilities." ;
