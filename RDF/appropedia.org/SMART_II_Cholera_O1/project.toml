function = "== Problem being addressed == Cholera continues to be a major cause of illness and death in developing countries, especially in post-natural disaster or post-conflict settings. In these settings, laboratory diagnosis of cholera may not be possible due to lack of electricity and trained personnel. Timely diagnosis is essential for appropriate treatment.   == Detailed description of the solution == The SMART II Cholera O1 test is a rapid diagnostic test that detects Vibrio cholerae-specific antigens within a human fecal sample. It can be performed in about 15 minutes, can be used by an unskilled technician, requires no electricity, and stores at room temperature."
