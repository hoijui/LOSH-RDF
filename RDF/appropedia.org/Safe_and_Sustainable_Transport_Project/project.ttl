    okh:function "The Peruvian government has asked the World Bank to aid, through loans and management, the development of a better transportation infrastructure—namely in the form of road repair, continual maintenance (the creation and institutionalization of maintenance programs), road safety improvement, and MTC (Ministry of Transport and Communications) infrastructure improvement for a more efficient use of this stimulus package. Peru's economy has seen record growth over the past few years, showing a jump from 7.7% GDP (gross domestic product) growth in 2006 to 9.8% in 2008, yet its economy has been severely hampered by low quality transportation infrastructure. About 80% of Peruvian firms surveyed by the World Bank reported that the infrastructure was of very low quality and was one of the most limiting factors to business growth. Peru's logistic costs are among the highest in Latin America. Understandably, traffic accidents are at a level that makes Peruvian conditions some of the worse in the region—both economically and in terms of people hurt or killed." ;
