Basic cam cleat designs are utilized for many functions. They are typically used as a quick release and locking mechanism for ropes and chords. These devices are usually found on sailing vessels as a method organize and hold lines. Additionally, with few modifications of this design, one being a pulley, a mechanical ascender should be able to be printed." ;
