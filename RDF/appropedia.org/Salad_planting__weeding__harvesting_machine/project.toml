function = "A tool to aid Salad production  I have a polytunnel growing salad. I'd like to reduce the amount of labour needed to grow the salad   == Understanding the market == This could be used in polytunnels or outdoors:  Inspired by farmbot Based on a track system Seed drills for sowing Hoe for precision raking Cutter for cutting   == Project goals == I'd like to design and build a tool that substantially reduces the labour time needed to grow salad.  Open Source Cheap Reliable   == Design == PVC water pipe Tracks will be installed down each side of the bed, screwed in with long screws The tool will run along these tracks, pushed by small solar electric motor. Wheels will be bicycle wheels used without tyres The tool will have interchangable tool heads for different tasks.   === Sowing === Three or four conventional roller seed drills will be attached to the machine."
