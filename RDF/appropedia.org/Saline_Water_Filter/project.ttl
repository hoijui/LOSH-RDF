    okh:function "== 3D Printable Salt Water Filter == Project developed by Dean Johnson   == Abstract ==  The idea of evaporating sea water in order to turn it into freshwater has been around for centuries or more. The technology has been used on ocean-going vessels that often spend months at sea without access to freshwater. I developed this saline water filter for the obvious reason of converting water from the ocean into potable drinking water for those without access to it. The concept behind the filter is extremely simple; Using solar energy in the form of sunlight to evaporate and then collect the fresh water. I printed it in four sections in order to illustrate the infinitesimal expandability of the design meaning that you that you can produce a fairly large filter from a relatively small printer." ;
