    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == The World Health Organization estimates that 1 million babies out of 15 million cases, die annually due to preterm birth and about 7% of all pregnant mothers in developing countries give birth prematurely. Preventative measures are not widely taken in these areas because there hasnâ€™t been successful ways of early preterm labor identification.   == Detailed description of the solution == The simple, non-invasive test detects signs of premature labor in pregnant mothers through their saliva. Research shows that a hormone, progesterone, in the saliva is irregularly low in women going into preterm labor. Detecting progesterone levels in pregnant mothers allows for doctors to identify women with high risk of premature birth and to treat accordingly." ;
