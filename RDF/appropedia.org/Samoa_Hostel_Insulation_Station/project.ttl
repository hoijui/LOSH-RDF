    okh:function "The Samoa Hostel is a joint effort of DANCO and the Humboldt Bay Center for Sustainable Living. Their goal is to incorporate sustainable living solutions into a hostel. They seek to do so by educating visitors about energy efficiency and sustainability. The hostel has a variety of displays and models illustrating environmentally friendly alternatives to common housing components. Our group was asked to construct an informational display designed to compare the efficiency and environmental impact of conventional and alternative insulation types." ;
