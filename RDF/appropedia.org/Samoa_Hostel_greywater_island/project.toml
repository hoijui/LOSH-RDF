As part of the sustainable operations of the Hostel, the greywater island functions as the largest implemented greywater treatment system in the restored facility. The greywater system was specifically designed under a criterion that would fulfill California state water quality standards, generate optimal functional capacities and require minimal maintenance and cost. the implemented greywater system was rendered by means of a custom made sizing calculator and graphical models of the design.   == Introduction == The historic Samoa Cookhouse will be the new host of an alternative lodging hostel where guests can engage in educational modules and experience the features and functions of sustainable design."
