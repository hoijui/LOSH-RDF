    okh:function "The Greywater Island project is a proposed Greywater treatment system for the Samoa Cookhouse and Hostel. As part of the sustainable operations of the Hostel, the greywater island functions as the largest implemented greywater treatment system in the restored facility. The greywater system was specifically designed under a criterion that would fulfill California state water quality standards, generate optimal functional capacities and require minimal maintenance and cost. the implemented greywater system was rendered by means of a custom made sizing calculator and graphical models of the design.   == Introduction == The historic Samoa Cookhouse will be the new host of an alternative lodging hostel where guests can engage in educational modules and experience the features and functions of sustainable design." ;
