function = "The purpose of this project is to create a new way for The Sanctuary to distribute donated food to the public in a free, convenient way. The project successfully met all of the weighted criterion set for the abundant free kiosk. The A-Team designed a permanent, weather-proof structure from which The Sanctuary can now easily distribute free food to the community of Arcata. The A-Team was brought together through the Humboldt State University class, Engineering 215 - Introduction to Design, taught by Lonny Grafman.   == Background == The Fall 2016 ENGR 215 class, taught by Lonny Grafman, made six different design projects for The Sanctuary, a local, nonprofit organization promoting sustainability and creativity."
