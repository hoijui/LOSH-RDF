    okh:function "The purpose of this project was to build a greywater filtration system to reduce fresh water use and inspire other to create reusable water resources. Our client hosts large parties and events regularly meaning many people from the community spend time at the site. Our team made the system look as inspirational as possible so that when community members see it, it may inspire them to create one of their own. A \"How To\" Manual can be found below to allow others to recreate our system at their own homes. This system specifically filters water from two kitchen sinks, however, it can be modified to filter washing machine runoff or showers." ;
