    okh:function "Humboldt State University's Engineering 215 Introduction to Design, introduces the Toilet to Sink Greywater System created by Team Greenlight at the Sanctuary in Arcata, California. The Santuary in Arcata proposed a design that would recycle greywater in order to reduce freshwater from being flushed down the toilet. Team Greenlight's objective is to design an aesthetically pleasing Sink to Toilet Greywater System that will effectively reuse the water used to wash one's hands by directing it into the toilet bowl. Fresh water is redirected from the toilet tank to the sink to use for hand washing, this reduces the total water output used in the restroom. The greywater that flows down the sink drain after hand washing, flows to the toilet bowl used for flushing waste down the toilet to the sewer." ;
