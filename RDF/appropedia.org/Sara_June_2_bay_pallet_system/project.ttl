    okh:function "This compost was to tend to the waste of a 4 person household in Arcata, California. The house had a garden beginning and produced a fair amount of green-waste. My goal was to have a flowing system that would produce finished compost over time but one that needed little turning. I also needed something I could deconstruct easily if I left the house. It was in budget and desire to take useable material out of the waste stream." ;
