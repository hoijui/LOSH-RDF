function = "A Patsari cookstove, nicknamed the Schatzari was built at the Schatz Energy Research Center (SERC) laboratory on May 27, 2010.  The purpose of this Appropredia page is to describe the construction process of the Patsari, with a particular focus on the modifications and deviations that were made from the document, \"Estufa Patsari; Manual de Construccion (EPMC).\" This page is intended to serve as an amendment to the construction manual that was published by the Grupo Interdisciplinario de Tecnolog√Æa Rural Apropiada (GIRA), and should not be considered a stand-alone document. The construction process marks the beginning of a collaboration between GIRA and SERC. The goal is to use the stove as a tool to develop research projects aimed at investigating the relationship between stove combustion design parameters and emissions of black carbon (BC). BC is a major contributor to global warming and accelerated glacial melt. Furthermore, emission of BC inside the home is a public health concern because of its role in causing chronic and acute respiratory diseases in groups that experience significant exposure, particularly in the Global South."
