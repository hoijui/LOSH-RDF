function = "== 2L Seeder / Salt Shaker == Project developed by [[[User:Kjkurtz|Kjkurtz]] (talk)]   == Abstract == With an over abundance of plastic bottles, there should be some attachments that can be made to make tools out of them! This design can fit any 2L bottle and can be scales down to fit other size bottles. This takes an old 2L pop bottle and turns it into a seed spreader/shaker. With the handle and easy to use adjuster, it is easy to control the flow of whatever you are spreading. Here in the North, this could also be used as a salt spreader for the winter months."
