function = "CIGS solar cells are based on chalcopyrite materials (copper iron sulfide mineral that crystallizes in the tetragonal system) which are produced from thin-film layers on inexpensive glass substrates. CIGS contains about 10% Cu, 28% In, 10% Ga, and 52% Se. There are significant advantages of these alloys; they span the energy-gap range needed to make an efficient single or multi-junction solar cell, they work well in the form of small-grained polycrystals, and they are not sensitive to impurities and crystalline defects. CIGS based solar cells have achieved efficiencies as high as 19.5% using vacuum deposition at NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory). Test modules and arrays based on CIGS have been operating outdoors for over 10 years with little degradation."
