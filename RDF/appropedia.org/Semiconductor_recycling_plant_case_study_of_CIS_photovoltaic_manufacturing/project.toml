function = "Copper indium (di)selenide (CIS) is a semiconductor material composed of copper, indium, and selenium. CIS is one of the better material choices for solar cells using a chalcopyrite-structured, which generally are produced by from thin-film layers on inexpensive soda-lime glass substrates. The significant advantages of CIS, CIGS and CIGSS alloyed semiconductors are the significantly large ranges of energy-gaps they span, including the highest efficiency range. CIS production methods include Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Sputtering as the primary methods of production. Currently the most efficient thin film CIS solar panel has an efficiency of 17.7%."
