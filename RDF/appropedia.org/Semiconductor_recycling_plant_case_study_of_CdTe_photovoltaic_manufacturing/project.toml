function = "Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) photovoltaic modules consist of five primary layers. These layers, especially the CdTe layer, are applied using a variety of deposition methods. Figure 1 depicts a basic flow diagram for the steps to produce these solar cells.  Further details of each layer, the deposition method used and equipment involved are described below. In order to produce these modules at production volumes, many manufactures are beginning to rely on automated single stream in-line manufacturing cells."
