function = "General Facts about Gallium Arsenide  Gallium = rarer than gold Arsenic = poisonous 5 cents per gram, $45,000 per ton. Product highly efficient photovoltaic cells Band gap = 1.43 eV Density = 5.316 g/cm^3 10x cost of Si at 50 cents to $1.50 a gram. $900,000 per ton Lower strength than Si Relatively insensitive to heat Resistant to radiation damage GaAs crystallizes into a cubic zinc blend called a sphalerite with is similar to a diamond cubic structure.   == Materials ==  GaAs only requires a few microns to absorb light (~5 microns) Usually part of concentrator cell - typical area of 0.25cm^2 typical g/m^2 assuming dimensions given above: Material per unit area = density * thickness Thickness = 5*10^-4cm Density = 5.316 g/cm^3 Material per unit area = 2.658*10^-3 g/cm^2 = 26.58g/m^2   == Processing == The steps to semiconductor processing are as follows:  Growth of Substrates (bulk crystals) Grinding and cutting Etching and polishing Epitaxial growth Masking Doping Metallization Alloying/annealing Finished product   ==== Bulk crystal growth ==== Bulk growth of GaAs can be done through the Liquid-encapsulated Czochralski method(LEC). The semiconductor is grown from a seed crystal to ensure a dislocation free lattice."
