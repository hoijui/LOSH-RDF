function = "The primary method for deposition of InGaN is Metal-organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), a form of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), pictorially discribed in Figure 1. This method creates layers of material with a thickness ranging between 15-60nm. The epitaxial layer is formed by pyrolysis of chemicals such as trimethylgallium (TMG), triethylgallium (TEG), and trimethylindium (TMI)  on GaN  or sapphire substrates.  Using sapphire substrates can cause complications in determining index of refraction through spectroscopic ellipsometry due to its transparency. In these situations GaN substrates are preferable."
