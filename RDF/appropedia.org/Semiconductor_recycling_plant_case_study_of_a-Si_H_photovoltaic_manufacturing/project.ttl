    okh:function "Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) is a semiconductor material that is primarily used in industry for the production of photovoltaic cells. A-Si:H is deposited on a substrate by the process known as Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition, or PECVD. Uni-Solar, or more formally United Solar, is a company that is currently using a-Si:H for solar panels. The process for production of these panels is very intricate and detailed. United Solar uses a triple junction thin film cell as opposed to a single junction because the efficiency of a triple junction cell is much higher. The structure for the triple junction thin film cell can be seen in figure 1." ;
