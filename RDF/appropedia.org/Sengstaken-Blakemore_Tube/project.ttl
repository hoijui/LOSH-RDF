    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Post Partum Hemorrhaging (PPH) is one of the leading causes of death among women in developing countries. The World Health Organization says that one woman dies every minute from a complication related to pregnancy or childbirth.  Health interventions designed to decrease maternal mortality, specifically ones that can treat and/or prevent PPH can have a significant impact in saving mothers' lives around the globe.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Sengstaken Blakemore tube is a medical device created in the 1950s.  Since then has been modernized and commercialized for widespread use to treat bleeding esophageal varices." ;
