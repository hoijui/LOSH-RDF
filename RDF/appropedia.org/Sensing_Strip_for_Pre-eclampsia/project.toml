function = "== Problem being addressed == Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are two leading causes of maternal death in low-resource settings.  Both conditions are difficult to diagnose.   == Detailed description of the solution == This low-cost, solar-powered sensing strip will detect the early presence of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. The skin of the strip is composed of flexible polymers and carbon-based materials. The strip will create an electrical current change when biomarkers indicating the presence of eclampsia are detected."
