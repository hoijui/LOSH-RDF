function = "Regardless of the risks involved, people do and will continue to live in the floodplain, both upstream and downstream from dams. And, as scientists and river managers have discovered, many of the dams constructed for flood management are no longer or have never fully achieved that objective. Floodplain management encompasses a wide variety of regulatory, planning and structural measures aimed at reducing the risk of loss of property and human lives in the event of a flood. Flood management measures include zoning, flood proofing, building standards, and warning systems. An important component of floodplain management is controlling the development of floodplains to place people and flood intolerant land uses in areas with relatively lower flood risk (i.e., land at higher elevation or greater distance from the river)."
