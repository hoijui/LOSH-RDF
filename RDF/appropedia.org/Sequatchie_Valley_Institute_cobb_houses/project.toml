function = "Sequatchie Valley Institute is a community in Sequatchie Valley, Tennessee, USA. It started as a homestead in 1971, when Carol, Johnny and their children moved onto the land and began making it their home. A log cabin was built first. A main house was constructed later using knowledge from Firefox books and taking ideas from Frank Lloyd Wright{wp sup| Frank Lloyd Wright}}. Much of the main house was designed with cantilever construction, taking some of Wright's design of a beam bearing a load without supports on both ends.(Cantilevers are cool). The big house has become the community center."
