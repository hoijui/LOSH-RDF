function = "The Sheba water filter is a new water filter design which should address four common problems of household water filtration in less developed regions: slow rates of filtration, difficulties in cleaning water filters, difficulties in adapting water filters to regional and seasonal variations in influent water and unattractive physical design making dissemination difficult to achieve. The proposed design addresses these problems and demonstrates two innovations: the use of cloth filtration bags to contain the filtration media - the ease of removal of the bags simplifies regular cleaning and permits simple modification of filters as seasonal conditions dictate. Sheba also contains a mechanism to allow the user to manually increase the water flow rate by means of mechanical pressurization. This design was prototyped using simple materials to demonstrate its potential as a low-cost option. Filtration was accomplished with sand, gravel and charcoal; while test results indicate the feasibility of the innovations, further work on adapting these to the South Indian context of Tamil Nadu is ongoing."
