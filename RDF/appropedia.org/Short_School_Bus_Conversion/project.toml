The \"Shorty\" includes a Diesel-powered engine, a Wheelchair lift, a rear Emergency exit, a stock 12V rear-heater attached to the engine coolant lines, and 106 square feet of flat floor space that can be converted into living space. The Owner of the Bus works as an Energy and Green Building Consultant, and designed the Bus Conversion to follow Best Practices in Green Building and Indoor Air Quality for a Mobile Shelter on a budget. Conversion Project Resources: www.skoolie.net.   == Housing in Arcata, CA == As a young Professional living in a small coastal town in Northern California, it's apparent that the price of property and housing is financially unattainable."
