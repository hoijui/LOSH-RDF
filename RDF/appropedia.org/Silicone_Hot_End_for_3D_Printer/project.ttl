    okh:function "== Understanding the market == A non-trivial cost of building a 3D printer is buying the hotend.  In some parts of the world, the cost of importing hotends is prohibitive.  Without considering the cost of shipping to remote areas of the world, a low-end hotend described as the \"most affordable 3D printer hotend yet\" retails for almost $32.  A hotend cast from silicone and nichrome wire in a printed PLA mold would significantly increase the availability of hotends in remote areas.   == Project goals == This project seeks to design a 3D printed mold in PLA to cast a silicone based hot end, into which a nichrome wire can be inserted as a heating element." ;
