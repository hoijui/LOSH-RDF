function = "Open source lab   == Simple Forest Densiometer == Project Developed by Brian Swanson User:Btswanso   == Abstract == The forest densiometer provides a practical, objective way to measure the density of tree canopy. This tool removes all guess work out of determining canopy cover, which is a very useful metric for foresters and construction companies looking to predict how much foliage and tree removal must be done in an specified area. Files may be downloaded off of the Thingiverse here: Files Or, the STL file is available here: File:Densiometer Mountable 2.stl  \t\t   == Proper Use == Align grid to the portion of canopy you wish to measure. Hold stationary, it is highly encourage to use a tripod with the associated mounts. Count the number of square holes filled over 50%, this number will be the density percentage of the canopy."
