function = "This device is meant to be a simple addition to a dwelling with a pre-installed eavestrough and gutter system. The system consists of a barrel and a small pump to allow for water to be distributed in a yard for irrigation purposes. This type of system should not be used for drinking water. The system will collect water from the eavestrough until the tank fills, extra water will leave through overflow valve. The pump in the system runs on 120 volt outlet and connects to a standard garden hose."
