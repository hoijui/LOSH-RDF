function = "During my master's program in Renewable Energy Engineering in the Faculty of New sciences and Technologies at University of Tehran, in the course \"Solar Energy\" I conducted a project under supervision of professor M. Mehrpooya on simulation of Photovoltaic thermal (PVT) systems and validate them with experiments.   The project succeeded and validation accuracy was high. Therefore, I proposed to him to localize and analyze this project using my country Iran.   Thus, we made a team, and I was honored to collaborate with professor M. Rosen form University of Ontario Institute of Technology to prepare it for the 4th World Sustainability Forum in Canada 2014.   Although the abstract was accepted, unfortunately it was prepared after a while."
