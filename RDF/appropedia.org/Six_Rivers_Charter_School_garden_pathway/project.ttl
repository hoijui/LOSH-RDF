    okh:function "Six Rivers Charter High School (abbrev. Six Rivers) in Arcata, California has a garden and outdoor learning space located at the bottom of a hill below the main classrooms. The staircase originally connecting the space to the rest of the school had fallen deep into disrepair and sorely needed to be replaced this year (Fall 2019). The team spent a few weeks researching pathway and stair design, slope stabilization, retaining walls, pathway construction, erosion control, and native plants before meeting with Six Rivers' Principal Ron Perry to establish their personal criteria for the design. The team was tasked with designing a pathway that is safe, wheelbarrow accessible, widely plantable, cost effective, ecologically sound and aesthetically pleasing." ;
