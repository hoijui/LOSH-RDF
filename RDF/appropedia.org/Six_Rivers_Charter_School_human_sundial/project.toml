function = "== About the Team == Keith Brennan, Briana Celest-Ruiz,  Salvador Garduno-Sanchez, Mikaela Shannon Environmental Resource Engineering students at Humboldt State University.   == Abstract == The Human Sundial is a design that Team Ocynthia chose as a project, a planned installation at Six Rivers Charter School in Arcata, CA. This school requested a sundial to be installed on the west end of campus, a shared space between Six Rivers Charter and Arcata High School. Our most important considerations consisted of an educational component for the students, longevity of the design, safety for those who interact with it and a visually striking design. The Human Sundial is a platform, where students can learn by interacting with the sundial on a regular basis watching their shadow change from each time and month in the year. The sundial emphasizes how the sun changes position in declination angle from each month in the year."
