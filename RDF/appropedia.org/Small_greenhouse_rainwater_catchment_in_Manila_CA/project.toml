function = "The global population has reached 7 billion people and continues to grow steadily. With the huge growth in our population, human beings have become more aware of the value of our limited resources. Many people are looking towards ways of sustainable living and preserving natural resources in order to survive in this rapidly growing population. One of the more abundant natural resource in Humboldt County is rainwater. This ecological awareness and the search for sustainability has lead me to designing a small rainwater catchment system for my greenhouse."
