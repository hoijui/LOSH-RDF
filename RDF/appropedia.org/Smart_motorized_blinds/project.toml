function = "This prototype of smart motorized blinds was created by the Queen's Solar Design Team to put into a demonstration solar home. The prototype is based of the design from the www.instructables.com user biochemtronics.[1] Though there are many blinds on the market that come with motors, they are often very expensive and do not have automatic elements installed. It would be more cost-effective to install a custom motor attached to a circuit box able to control the tilt of manual blinds based on ambient settings. The goal of this project is to open the tilt of the blinds during the day and close them at night, allowing natural light to fill the house during the day and giving privacy in the evening. Additionally, these blinds will contain a temperature sensor to close the blinds if the interior becomes too warm."
