To see the literature review of this topic, click here The \"Smart\" solar shade project is designed to be a two step process: first to simulate the potential savings by utilizing an automated window shade system is utilized to heat or cool a room, followed by then demonstrating such a system experimentally.   = Simulation = Please spend some time thinking about this after you build and have a working prototype how do we move that towards publication see email in relation to simulation ideas   = Experiment =   == Hardware ==   === Design Considerations ===   ==== Component Sizing ====   ===== Electric Motor ===== Servo, stepper, and DC motors were considered for the window blind actuation. The cheapest option was found to be a geared hobby motor utilizing a potentiometer for position feedback. The GM3 geared hobby motor provides up to .34 Nm of torque at ultracapacitor voltage.   ===== Ultracapacitor ===== The power storage component was fortunately given from a cost standpoint, but unfortunate from an engineering standpoint."
