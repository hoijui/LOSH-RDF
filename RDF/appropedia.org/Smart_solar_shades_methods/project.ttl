    okh:function "This page contains methods on the topic of \"smart\" solar shades using PV. To see the literature review of this topic, click here The \"Smart\" solar shade project is designed to be a two step process: first to simulate the potential savings by utilizing an automated window shade system is utilized to heat or cool a room, followed by then demonstrating such a system experimentally.   = Simulation = Please spend some time thinking about this after you build and have a working prototype how do we move that towards publication see email in relation to simulation ideas   = Experiment =   == Hardware ==   === Design Considerations ===   ==== Component Sizing ====   ===== Electric Motor ===== Servo, stepper, and DC motors were considered for the window blind actuation. The cheapest option was found to be a geared hobby motor utilizing a potentiometer for position feedback. The GM3 geared hobby motor provides up to .34 Nm of torque at ultracapacitor voltage.   ===== Ultracapacitor ===== The power storage component was fortunately given from a cost standpoint, but unfortunate from an engineering standpoint." ;
