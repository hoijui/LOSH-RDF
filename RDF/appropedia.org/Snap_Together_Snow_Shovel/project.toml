function = "== Snap Together Snow Shovel == Project developed by Brett Hulbert   == Abstract == This project consists of multiple components that can be assembled into a full scale snow shovel. Some commercial shovels are very expensive, and their only purpose is to pick up snow and place it somewhere else. For someone who cannot afford an expensive snow shovel, this design is appropriate for them, as this is a task that can very easily be obtained by 3D printable components. Each component to the design were all used using open source hardware and software. Additionally, this design was created to require the least amount of outside tools and assembly."
