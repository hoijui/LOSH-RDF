    okh:function "== Snap Together Shovel == Project developed by Cleyton Cavallaro   == Abstract == This shovel was designed to be a tool that can be fully modulated for the users current needs and environment. Shovels are used everywhere and are almost a necessity if moving large amounts of something dirt like. This shovel can be fully 3D printed if necessary. If the user has access to sticks or branches, the user can print off the wooden shaft attachments instead of the 3D printed shaft, saving time and money. If the user find a piece of scrap sheet metal, they can print off the sheet metal attachment instead of printing the blade, again saving time and money." ;
