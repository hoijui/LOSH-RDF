function = "untested not ergonomic upper supports weak too much mass in unnecessary locations- bulkiness yet not sturdy enough for use   == Title of the device or system == Project developed by Ickesler   == Abstract == Snowshoes help to maneuver through a snowy terrain by foot. They allow someone to walk on top of the snow as opposed to sinking down into the snow with every step. This allows for easier movement across powdered snow, without taking a lot of effort to pull your foot out of knee deep snow with every step. This snowshoe design allows someone to print a snowshoe on a 3D printer that utilizes a 1/2\" tubing for the outer support, and twine for the straps. All of these supplies are fairly cheap and easy to transport."
