function = "== Problem being addressed == An estimated 6-10% of all newborn mortality is due to jaundice or jaundice complications. In Africa and South Asia, 5.7 million newborns do not receive phototherapy treatment for jaundice. This is largely because electrical sources to power phototherapy devices are limited in low resource settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == This portable, low-cost phototherapy blanket uses 200 blue LED light bulbs to provide light therapy to jaundiced infants. It’s flexible photovoltaic panel harnesses solar energy to power the blanket’s battery, eliminating the need for electrical power sources."
