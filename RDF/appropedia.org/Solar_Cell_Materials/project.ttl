    okh:function "Solar Cells are devices that convert solar energy (incident photons) into electricity. So far, Silicon is the mostly used material in the solar cell industry, because of its cost, availability and the presence of appropriate manufacturing technology. However, the problem with Silicon is its indirect bandgap (1.12 eV). Apart from Silicon, III-V and II-VI compounds have got enormous potential for solar cell applications because many of them have direct, optimum optical bandgap, along with high optical absorption capability. On top of this, structural, electrical and optical properties can be optimized towards higher efficiency while using ternary and quaternary III-V compounds." ;
