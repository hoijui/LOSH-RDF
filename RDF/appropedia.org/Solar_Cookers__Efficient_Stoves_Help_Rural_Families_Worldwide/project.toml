function = "Better technology and user marketing attracts help from aid agencies. The use of technologies that combine solar power and energy efficiency is helping a growing segment of the more than 3 billion people in the developing world who burn traditional biomass fuels -- including wood and animal dung -- indoors for cooking and heating. The current cooking practice, according to the World Health Organization, traps high levels of pollutants in the living area and causes 1.6 million premature deaths every year, mainly among women and children. It also ravages trees, brush and other ground cover, promoting erosion and flooding in many areas that already are vulnerable to such occurrences. \"If this is the last tree in the whole country,\" Patricia McArdle told USINFO, referring to a photograph from Afghanistan, \"and that lady has to cook dinner, she will cut that tree down and take it home."
