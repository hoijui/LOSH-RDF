    okh:function "The U.S. Department of Energy'sW Solar Decathlon is a competitive program in which teams of college students compete to think of, create and operate solar-powered houses. These houses must be good-looking, energy-efficient and cost-effective as they will be judged for the program. The team that builds the best houses, based on energy use/consumption, great design and best looking for the consumers wins the Solar Decathlon. The competition allows visitors to look at the houses built for free and during certain hours to see how they can make their own homes more energy-efficient, more environmentally friendly or to just make their bills cheaper. The first Solar Decathlon was held in 2002; the competition has since occurred biennially in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011." ;
