    okh:function "Makeshift solar distiller/desalinater with the goal of sustainable drinking water for people who need it In a place where the sun shines very often, no one should be without drinking water. I made this project with $20 and an old satellite dish, a mylar blanket, two mason jars, one rubber tube, a frying pan, an ace bucket, the bottom half of an umbrella and about 30 pounds of Tahoe sand  has to be cheap to be feasible needs sunlight Toughest part is getting a satellite dish   == Project goals == Give everyone in the world a way to have sustainable drinking water, this is only part of the solution.   == Design == My idea was to cover the satellite dish in mylar, making it into a parabolic mirror on the cheap. This was the entire point of the project because parabolic mirrors are expensive, and broken satellite dishes and mylar are fairly cheap. I would then focus sunlight from the parabolic mirror onto a frying pan with a jar of dirty water in it." ;
