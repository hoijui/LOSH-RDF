    okh:function "The need for renewable energy technologies has become apparent and is continuously gaining speed, particularly due to increasing concerns about climate change, pollution, and predicted non-affordable costs related to fossil fuels consumption. Among the renewable energy sources (RESs), solar and wind energy have gained much more attention in electricity generation since 2008 . However, not only does the absolute dependence on solar and wind energy have some technical challenges, but they can not afford the whole energy demands of the world. It is worth noting that the overall primary energy use was expected to rise from 550 EJ (EJ=exajoule=1018 joule) in 2015 to 720 EJ in 2035, let alone all RESs were forecast to roughly double from their 2015 level of 52.7 EJ to 119.6 EJ in 2035 . Nima Asgari, an independent researcher in the field of renewable energies, has raised a proposal to address the challenges of solar energy (especially photovoltaics) harnessing without taking advantage of other RESs and other supplementary technologies." ;
