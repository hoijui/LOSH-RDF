    okh:function "== Understanding the market ==  Solar Hydro-Thermal Project  Using the sun as energy & Using water as energy (heat) storage Both existing and future homes can incorporate simple hydro-thermal systems. We know that these systems work, but I feel the need to have hands on experimenting to explore it for myself and inspire others around me to explore this vast source of clean heat (the sun). My design is setup to do that. If I were to raise it a little it could operate as an outdoor shower, or if I were to lengthen the piping I could use it for indoor water/space heating.  My interest in this project also extends to thermal mass technology." ;
