In some areas, all water supplies are contaminated by microbes. Water is seldom boiled due to the time and fuel required. UNICEF indicates that diarrhea is the most common childhood disease in the developing world. Diarrhea-related dehydration is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five and annually, an estimated five million children die from it." ;
