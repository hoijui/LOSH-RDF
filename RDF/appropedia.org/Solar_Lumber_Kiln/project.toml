function = "== Introduction == The wood hobbyist or small custom furniture maker often has difficulty obtaining small amounts of kiln-dried lumber. For these peopleâ€š rapid production-type drying is not critical. Kiln drying, or further drying, is required because wood for interior use in the United States should be at a moisture content of 6 to 8 percent. Described here is a low-cost solar-heated lumber dryer, essentially free of dependency on fossil fuels for energy. It is not intended for commercial operations where speed of drying is important."
