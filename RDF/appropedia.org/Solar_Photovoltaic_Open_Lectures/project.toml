function = "This is a series of five fully annotated Power Point presentations created for the solar energy community to assist in the dissemination of information about solar photovoltaic (PV) cells in 2006. They have been updated by students in MECH820, a graduate engineering course in photovoltaic materials, devices, and systems in 2010. In order to make these presentations more accessible the updates have been transformed to odp, an Open Office format. You can download Open Office for free here.  The first presentation \"Solar Photovoltaic Physics\" Solar1 (ppt), which is the most technical, covers the science behind PV. Solar1.pdf, odp The second presentation \"Engineering Photovoltaic Systems I\" Solar2 (ppt) is about the basic engineering of photovoltaic systems."
