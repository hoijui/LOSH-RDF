    okh:function "Solar Pura is an appropriate technology project aiming to provide safe drinking water by harnessing the power of the sun. Around 2 billion people lack access to clean drinking water across the globe and many of those live in arid and remote areas perfect for the implementation of a highly efficient, low cost, small scale solar still. The aim is for it to produce between 5-10 liters of fresh water per day in a sunny climate, enough for a small family's needs. The design has been optimised to be lightweight, low cost, robust and user friendly. And a scale functional prototype has been built and tested." ;
