    okh:function "== Abstract == This page describes how to design and built a solar tracking system using Arduino. Usage of solar systems are increasing rapidly and the technology is advancing day by day. The sunlight only lasts during the day and we need to get the maximum usage of sun during the day.    == Project goals == Efficiency of a solar panel is typically around 20%. Although there panels that have high efficiency than 20% they are not for commercial use as their costs are relatively high." ;
