function = "== Description of Project ==  Build a solar batch water heater and install at my residents in La Quinta, California. My initial proposal was of my own design and this has not changed but I did make some changes as the project progressed currently have no regrets with my final project other than some changes which still need to be made but I was expecting changes and some cost over runs.   == Changes to Original Design == The first major change came when I decide to make a Â¾ inch copper grid instead of using an old hot water tank. I do think the water tank will work and I may install an additional tank in future. The second major change was I found a T valve which was designed to be used on a conventional water heater by removing the drain spigot this prevented additional plumbing."
