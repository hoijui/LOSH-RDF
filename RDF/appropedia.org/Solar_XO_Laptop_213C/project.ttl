    okh:function "Executive Summary: The non-profit organization OLPC (One Laptop Per Child) is looking for a cheap and effective way to power their laptops. One of the ways to obtain this power is though solar power. About 15 watts of power must be outputted through a solar panel that is connected to the laptop, and this solar panel cannot be more than $80 in price, nor can it be too large to comfortably carry around with the laptop. It would also be beneficial for the solar powered laptop to also be durable, functional, and energy efficient. The problem is that this laptop is to be distributed to children in 3rd world countries who do not have a lot of money." ;
