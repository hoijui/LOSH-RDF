    okh:function "Executive Summary:  The “XO Laptop,” from the “One Laptop Per Child Foundation” is an inexpensive laptop intended to help children in developing countries express themselves for educational purposes. Unfortunately, the average household in these developing countries do not have access to electricity to charge these laptops . In order to allow these children to bring these laptops home to be used, a solar panel laptop charger must be designed.  Because the main consumers of the laptop charger are children, the design for the charger must be durable, practical and easy to use. In addition, because this design will be released to developing countries, it must be inexpensive and affordable." ;
