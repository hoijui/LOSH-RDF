function = "Executive Summary of Project:  One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), a non-profit organization, has been distributing XO-laptops to children in third world countries. Whenever consumers purchase an XO-laptop for themselves, OLPC also provides one to a child somewhere in the world. The problem was the need to power these XO laptops in communities where access to electricity is limited to only schools, or non-existent altogether. The proposed solution was the use of solar panels to harness the sun's energy to charge the computers. This project involves the production of a robust, waterproof solar panel casing that produced sufficient power to energize the laptop, while remaining relatively easy to build and inexpensive."
