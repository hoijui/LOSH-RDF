    okh:function "The solar design t-square is a simple physical device that models the sun passing over a new solar reflector design. Using clay and \"stop motion\" changes to little mirrors, I made successful models and a full size Clam shaped reflector for 2 hours of unattended solar cooking. At full power!  I believe it could be used to design better panel cookers than any that exist today in about 4 hours. So you could have reflectors designed specifically for 1 hour unattended cooking, 1.5 hours or 2 hours, depending on what is needed." ;
