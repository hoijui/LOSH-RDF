    okh:function "This article is based on an Ashden Awards case study of Fruits of the Nile, who won an Ashden Award for their work in 2008.   == Summary == Southern Uganda has abundant sunshine and rainfall, and fruit like bananas, pineapple, and pawpaw grows well, as do other crops. Many smallholder farmers grow fruit as their main cash crop, but much of the fruit goes to waste, particularly during the months of peak production, because there is insufficient market within a reasonable transport distance. Fruits of the Nile is a Ugandan dried fruit company which has helped to get the spare fruit production from rural growers to international markets, and in doing so brought skills and income all along the supply chain. The company buys fruit from 120 registered primary producer groups, which it has trained in organic farming, hygiene, fruit drying, and business management." ;
