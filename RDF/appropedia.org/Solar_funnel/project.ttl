    okh:function "A solar funnel is the basis for many solar cooking designs. In it, light is funneled by flat reflectors to a pot or other surface to be heated which is located on the other end of the funnel. This differs from designs where the pot sits between the sun and the reflectors, as in most parabolic cookers. A solar funnel is the flat version of the more idealized Compound Parabolic Concentrator.   == Proper design == Most sources of information on the internet about solar funnel type solar concentrators are vague about the details of tilting the reflectors." ;
