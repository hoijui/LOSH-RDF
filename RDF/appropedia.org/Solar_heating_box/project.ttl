    okh:function """My project is to design and test a passive solar heating box. The objective of the design is to collect heat and transfer it into a house via convection. Solar heating boxes are appropriate technology because it utilizes the resource available in an effective manner. This type of design is appropriate in almost any location, being that its means of energy are solar and natural convection. Passive solar designs can provide a comfortable environment anywhere from garages and workshops to third world villages.
