function = "On Site Solar Hot Water on Haeger Ave, Arcata Presentation by Alan Cook  Solar hot water systems are also referred to as solar thermal heating systems. In a thermal heating system water runs through the panel in a closed loop to gather heat from the solar collector. The cold water is pumped from the bottom of the storage tank when there is a 16 degree difference between the tank and the solar collector. Heat is gathered from the collector and brought back down to the storage tank.  Due to expansion of water when frozen the solar collector cannot have water in freezing temperatures."
