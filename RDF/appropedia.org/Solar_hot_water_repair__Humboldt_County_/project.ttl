    okh:function "Hot Water Solar Repair Supervisor: Ben Scurfield  This solar hot water system was one of the first in Humboldt County. This system is over 30 years old and part of Arcataâ€™s pilot program for renewable energy systems. It had a slow leak from both of the dribble valves which are necessary for an open looped system. The advantage of and open looped system is added efficiency from not having a heat exchanger. The old valves were replaced after draining the collectors into a bucket from the drain outlet shown in the next picture." ;
