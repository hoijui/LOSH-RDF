function = "== Spoke Wrench and Tire Lever == Created by Paul StLouis   == Abstract == This OSAT consists of a spoke wrench and tire lever pair. The spoke wrench is used to loosen and tighten spokes on bike wheels when trying to true a wheel. The tire lever and spoke wrench are an appropriate OSAT because bikes in developing areas are nearly always repaired or re-purposed if they are damaged. If the wheel of a bike becomes damaged there are people who repair or \"true\" the wheel. The tire levers are used to assist in the tire removal process while the spoke wrench is used to tighten or loosen spokes to help true the wheel back to its original state."
