    okh:function "| health-topic = Maternal mortality | health-classification = Diagnosis }}   == Problem being addressed == Accurate measurement of vital signs is important to properly monitor patients. In areas where limited trained personnel are limited, it can be hard to get accurate numbers due to lack of staff and time to check for vital signs.    == Detailed description of the solution == The Spot Vital Signs device measures the blood pressure, pulse, and temperature of patients accurately and rapidly. It is a portable device that runs on battery power. The device measures blood pressure in 15 seconds and is able to store data from previous measurements." ;
