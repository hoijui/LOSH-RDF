function = "Project to make a stand for SLA device.   === Project ===  Stereolithography is a form of 3-D printing technology used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts in a layer-by-layer fashion using photopolymerization, a process by which light causes chains of molecules to link, forming polymers. One of the key factors to prepare the SLA device for printing resins is fixing the dish of resin in appropriate place, so that it cannot move during the printing process. This stand not only can improve the quality of printing process but also protect the petri dish to slide. In this project a stand with 2 separate parts was designed and a petri dish with the diameter=114 mm (common size) can be fixed between 2 parts."
