    okh:function "This manual describes the design and construction of a device which, when attached to a standard bicycle, will permit it to be used as a pedal‑power machine. The resulting machine, known as a dual-purpose bicycle, can be used to power numerous small‑scale mechanical devices such as grain threshers, grinders, water pumps, electrical generators, and a variety of small machine tools. When desired, the dual-purpose bicycle can be converted from its transportation mode to its pedal‑power mode, or vice versa within a matter of minutes. It should be noted that the design criteria, materials used, and the procedures adopted in construction may be modified to suit local situations. It is suggested that low-cost and readily available materials and standard bicycle parts be substituted whenever possible." ;
