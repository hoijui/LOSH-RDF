function = "We are taking Engr305 â€“ Appropriate Technology at Humboldt State University. The project we have chosen is to design and build furniture made from cardboard for those people who want to save money, reduce their carbon footprint, or just be creative. We want to demonstrate that stylish furniture can be made completely from recycled materials at a very low cost.  Our plan:   To up-cycle all or most of our materials, e.g. taken out of the waste stream."
