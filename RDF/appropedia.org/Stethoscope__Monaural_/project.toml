function = "== Monaural Stethoscope == Project developed by Jordan LaFontaine   == Abstract == This design could fall under the 3rd \"OSAT Sustainable Development Goal\" for good health and well being. Strictly speaking, stethoscopes aren't required to listen to someones heartbeat. A trained professional could get the information they need simply by pressing their ear up against the patient's chest. However, a good stethoscope makes the process both easier and more comfortable. Here is a link to the original inspired design invented by Charles J.B. Williams around 1835: [1]   == Bill of Materials == The only required materials are a 3D printer and filament."
