    okh:function "== Stethoscope Upgrade - OSAT project == Project developed by [[[User:Kev Man|Kev Man]] (talk) 23:21, 7 December 2015 (PST)]   == Abstract == 3D printed stethoscope (with minimal/cheap non-3D printed parts). Having 3D printed medical diagnostic equipment could give underprivileged areas cheap and easy access to much needed tools, while also letting these areas save money for more complex equipment that they may not have had access to otherwise.   == Bill of Materials == Non-Printed parts  1/2\" (outer diameter) Black rubber tubing - 24\" long - (~ $8.00 USD  / 5 ft) 2\" (outer diameter) plastic O-ring (~ $2.00 / 2 ) 1/2\"(outer diameter) tygon tubing - 2 pieces 6cm long (~ $40.00 USD / 10 feet) small balloon (5\" round if blown up) - pack of 30 ~ $2.00 USD Epoxy - any type   == Source and STL files == Thingiverse link   == Tools needed ==  MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer Scissors or knife   == Skills and knowledge needed == If you used special skill â€“ link to relevant wikipedia or wikiversity articles/courses No special skills needed to make OSAT   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Include print time estimate ~ 4 hrs, 30 min. Include assembly time estimate - 5 minutes To assemble:  Print all pieces Cut tubing to lengths mentioned above. Add epoxy to the outside of the cylindrical part of the nozzle Insert the nozzle into the diaphragm with the tapper end facing out (epoxy end goes into the diaphragm)." ;
