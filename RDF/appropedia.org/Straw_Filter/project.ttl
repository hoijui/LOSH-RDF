    okh:function "== Straw Filter == Project developed by Brad Revett (talk)   == Abstract == Having an instant source of drinking water anywhere you can find water is a hard thing to come by in the developing world and while out backpacking in nature. This 3D printable straw filter should allow for cheaper and more readily available access to clean water at a lower price as most of the components of a water filter are things we come across every day. The main components of most survival water filters today are gravel, sand and activated carbon. These three things in addition to a cloth of some sort to keep the described things from going into our water are what make up a water filter that will filter out most of the harmful things.    == Bill of Materials == 3D printed bottom of the straw: Estimated cost is $0.62 based on 20$ for a 1kg roll of filament and an approximate use of 31g for the print." ;
