function = "Student-Powered Rec Center Project is to determine the amount of electricity that could be produced at the Student Rec Center at Humboldt State University using the existing Cardio-vascular stationary machines. The second part of the experiment was to compare the costs and amount of electricity that could potentially be produced at the SRC to the Team Dynamo, a stationary bicycle team that was produced by Mike Taggett of Henry Works, Inc. There is energy being wasted on campus that could potentially be used to offset some of HSU's energy demands. At the Student Recreation Center students, staff and faculty members use the various types of cardiovascular work-out machines throughout the day and in the process they produce kinetic energy that could be utilized as electricity.   == Project Requirements == Dick Hansis (2008) states that the mission of the course is to \"learn environmental problem-solving through engagement in real-world situations by applying knowledge gained in other courses as well as new skills learned in this course.\" Melissa Buehler and Dana Martin decided to create electricity at the Student Rec Center (SRC) using cardio-vascular machines that students, faculty and staff already use in order to meet their daily exercise needs."
