function = "SunnyBag is a project that aims to deliver mobile solar energy to various low power dc devices like all standard Smartphones, cell phones, mp3 players, digital cameras, iPads (in Standby mode), etc. This is a good innovation because of the mobile nature of sucking the solar energy combined with the mobile nature of the devices intended to be powered.   == Features == The material of the backpack is made from a particularly robust \"renewable sourced polymer\" called Sorona® by DuPont, which consists of corn starch – not mineral oil. Flexible, off-grid solar unit on the backpack, which can also be removed and attached to other backpacks and bags. A Smartphone pocket on the shoulder strap with an integrated charging unit."
