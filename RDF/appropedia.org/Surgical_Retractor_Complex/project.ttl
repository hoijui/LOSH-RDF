    okh:function "== Complex Surgical Retractor == Project developed by Tyler Jubenville   == Abstract == This design seeks to address the high cost and many variations of complex surgical retractors used today. This design is intended to serve as a potential cheaper replacement for surgeons today, or in locations where sterilization techniques and equipment are not ideal.   == Bill of Materials ==  STL and Openscad files available at Thingiverse   == Tools needed ==  MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer 5 mm and 6 mm Allen Wrenches   == Skills and knowledge needed == This project is simple to assemble and no special skills are required.   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Be sure to print with support material turned on, to ensure the modular tip components print. Print (About 3 hour print time, with 0.1 mm Layer height, 50% fill density) Place one side of the retractor on top of the other and insert 6mm screw through the hole closest to handle." ;
