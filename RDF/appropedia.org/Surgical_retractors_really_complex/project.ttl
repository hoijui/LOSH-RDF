    okh:function "== Modular Surgical Retractor Ring == Project developed by [Leighton Gaines (user:ldgaines)]   == Abstract == Surgical retractors are used in order to hold tissue aside while surgery is performed on some underlying bodily structure. Depending on the size and depth of the cavity as well as the area of the body being accessed, different retracting implements as well as retractor ring sizes and shapes are needed. This project is a preliminary attempt to create a modular retractor ring and pinnable retractors that are all entirely 3D printed. Picture of completed print    == Bill of Materials == Plastic: PLA or other structurally similar plastic Printed Components Ring Module Retractor Scoop Retainer Ring EasyPin [STL and OpenSCAD files: https://www.youmagine.com/designs/modular-surgical-retractor-ring] As a rule of thumb for components, a closed loop composed of ring modules will require a retainer ring for every module. Every retractor scoop will require one EasyPin." ;
