function = "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) refers to the successor goal set following the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The goals were finalised and presented in September 2015 (25-27 September) in New York, USA. The official term for the whole agenda is Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs have addressed numerous criticisms that were levelled at the MDGs, principally a concern that while the MDGs' targets were largely \"achieved\", they focused on the symptoms, and they had failed to account for equity and environmental sustainability. Moreover, uneven progress in achieving the MDGs occurred due to the use of global indicators. By contrast, the SDGs are meant to focus on the symptoms and their development was formed through much more transparent processes than experienced with the MDGs.The SDGs were a result of the largest consultation process undertaken in United Nations history."
