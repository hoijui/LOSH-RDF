    okh:function "For this project I designed a lesson plan and power point with the intention of educating young students about alternative energy systems and sustainable construction.  The reason for this was because it is very important for children to be exposed to ideas of sustainability at a young age in order to ensure a better future.  I came up with the idea of this project for my Alternative Energy class at Sierra Nevada College.  Throughout the semester, while we learned about energy systems and sustainable construction, I thought to myself how weird it was that I hadn't been exposed to any of that material yet in my education.  It got me thinking how much society and the planet would benefit from each generation being exposed to the ideas of sustainability much earlier in life." ;
