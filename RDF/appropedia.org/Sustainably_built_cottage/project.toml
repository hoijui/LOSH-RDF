function = "One of the most important decisions one makes about housing is its size. Smaller houses cost less initially, have lower maintenance (for example, are easier to keep up, take less time to keep clean, have lower utility costs), and of course have less impact on their building site by displacing less of the natural ecosystem. Small houses have a venerable history in America. Thoreau's 150 square foot cabin was a source of inspiration for Walden, his classic work examining nature, simplicity, and spirituality. Mother Earth News has updated the concept with an attempt to recapture his idea, even lending a new name, the \"microhouse\"."
