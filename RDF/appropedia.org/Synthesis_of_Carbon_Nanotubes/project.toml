function = "A review of current and prospective methods for efficient large-scale production of carbon nanotubes Since carbon nanotubesW were first observed in 1991, years of research have been invested into mass producing these remarkable structures. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the potential to revolutionize materials engineering, making it possible to create materials with novel properties. The optimization of CNT synthesis processes on a large scale is necessary to make nanotubes a feasible material for implementation in nano-scale devices and materials.   == Overview == CNTs are a highly desirable material because of their unique properties. They are a derivative of fullerenesW, formed from chains of C2 dimersW and C3 trimersW with hemispherical caps."
