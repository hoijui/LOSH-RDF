    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == TB kills an estimated 2-3 million people per year worldwide, with an estimated 50% of cases going undiagnosed. Unfortunately, the TB skin test, which has been used for the past century, is prone to false negatives and false positives, particularly in developing country settings. In developing countries, a more specific and sensitive test is needed.   == Detailed description of the solution == The T-SPOT TB test measures the specific antigens that stimulate the effector T cells. Effector T cells are short-lived, and their presence indicates that the cellular immune response is currently countering pathogens, and is diagnostic of an active infection." ;
