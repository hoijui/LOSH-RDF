function = "== Problem being addressed == Contaminated water sources are often the cause for diarrheal diseases. Inhabitants in low-resource settings often lack ready access to clean water and are most susceptible to diseases caused by contaminated water.   == Detailed description of the solution == The TATA Swach is a standalone unit that purifies water.  The water is poured at the top of the unit and flows through a paddy husk ash filter.  The filter using ash as a matrix kills approximately 80% of the bacteria causing diseases."
