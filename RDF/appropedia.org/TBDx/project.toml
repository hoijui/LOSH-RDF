function = "== Problem being addressed == With drug-resistant strains of TB outpacing the effectiveness of available treatments, this disease is again on the rise, infecting more than 8 million people every year. As the current treatments are expensive (up to 40000$), TB is prevalent in resource-limited settings. To prevent the spreading of this disease, accurate, efficient, and quick diagnosis is required.   == Detailed description of the solution == TBDx is a fully automated sputum smear (mucus) microscopy diagnostic solution for the detection of TB. It adds image processing to the routine smear microscopy, has a step-by-step guide for setup and process initialization, utilizes touchscreen capabilities and simple to understand features, and can support up to a 200-slide autoloader system for higher production environments. These features, combined with a lower cost-per-slide (~2.50$ compared to 10$), a reduction in the manpower needed (fully automated system), its ability to be used in a mobile laboratory environment, and its speed (reduced time from 6 minutes per slide to 2) can lead to savings of 79$ per case detected, or 66.9% savings of the typical cost of diagnosis."
