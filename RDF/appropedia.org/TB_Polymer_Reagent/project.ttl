    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Tuberculosis (TB) continues to infect approximately 8 million people per year, particularly in resource-limited areas. Current diagnostic solutions require training, are expensive, or are time consuming, limiting the techniques and products viability in such zones. Affordable and accurate diagnosis and treatment can lead to saving hundreds of thousands of lives and helping to eliminate the disease.   == Detailed description of the solution == Phillips is working to develop a polymer reagent that will detect proteins secreted by tuberculosis from sputum (mucus) samples. The reagent will indicate TB-positive samples by changing color." ;
