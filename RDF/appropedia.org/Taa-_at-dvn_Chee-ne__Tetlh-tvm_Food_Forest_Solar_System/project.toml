function = "The Taa-'at-dvn Chee-ne' Tetlh-tvm' Food Forest in Crescent City at College of the Redwoods Del Norte serves to increase healthy food acess, create a living laboratory for regenerative food production, host workshops, programs and events for the community. Our Appropriate Technology class at Humboldt State University in the Spring of 2021 partnered with them to bring power to their community. To align with their sustainable model we designed a solar system with four panels mounted on a pole that would best suit their needs. This system would help kick start the growing season in the chillier climate by powering four seed mats in their greenhouse and potentially fans during the summertime to increase greenhouse air circulation and temperature moderation. The system would come with proper electrical outlets and a battery to be able to bring power in a variety of ways to the site, only increasing the Food Forest's ability to best serve their community."
