function = "== Table Saw Fence Push Stick == Project developed by User:JasonBell   == Abstract == This part solves the problem of making very thin cuts on a table saw in a safe way. All current push sticks or push blocks on the market do not allow for cuts under 1/2\" while still maintaining the guards over the saw blade. This push stick rides on the fence of the saw and allows for a safer cut and makes smaller cuts possible without ruining the user's push stick.   == Bill of Materials == This part can be fully printed and no other components are necessary. Click Here for STL and Source Code   == Tools needed ==  MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == Product is to be used on a table saw."
