    okh:function "Holding as many as twenty four-inch tablets of chlorine, the chlorinators we use in Port-au-Prince can treat 5000 gallons of water each day, thus helping stop waterborne diseases in Haiti. Most of our sites serve up to 10,000 Haitians by providing water to family members who stand in line with 5-gallon plastic buckets. When full, each bucket weighs forty pounds, a heavy burden for a child who totes one.   == Design == Each Chlorinator treats 10% of the water going into the local tank by running it through the tablet chamber. That process puts enough chlorine into the water to treat the entire tank contents." ;
