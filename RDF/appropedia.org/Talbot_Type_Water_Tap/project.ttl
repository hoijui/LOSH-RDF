    okh:function "== Talbot Type Water Tap == Project developed by Eric Bauer   == Abstract == Talbot water taps are used extensively throughout the low income countries of the world. This type of tap is extremely useful for them, but is often quite expensive to purchase; sometimes so expensive that they can't get them. This type of tap allows for automatic shutoff of the water when it is released due to the water pressure pushing it closed. This 3D printable version is 89% cheaper than a standard quarter turn water tap (these are even cheaper than a Talbot tap). Not only is this OSAT low cost, it is also extremely easy to make: simple 3D print, no support material, no extra tools needed, and a very simple assembly procedure." ;
