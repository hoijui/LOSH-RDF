    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Recent studies have shown that circumcision is up to 60% effective in reducing the transmission of HIV/AIDS. The HIV epidemic continues to spread in many African countries 	and widespread circumcision of adult males could prevent millions from contracting the virus.  Easy-to-use devices are a useful means of performing circumcisions in regions with limited resources.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Tara Klamp uses plastic arms to trap the foreskin and perform circumcision without creating an open wound or the need for sutures or ligatures following the procedure.  The 	Tara Klamp can be used to circumcise both infants and adults and comes in eight different sizes.  It could be especially effective in developing settings such as sub-Saharan Africa where there is limited training for the procedure to be carried out safely and hygienically." ;
