This page is for the main Team X Appropedia page located at https://www.appropedia.org/Wetlands_Water_Meter   == The Arduino Program == The Arduino runs off of an open source downloadable program which can be downloaded from this site.  The user designs programs that are then uploaded to the Arduino.  These sections of code can be inputted straight into the Arduino program and compiled (compiling means to run the code to make sure the code has no programming errors in it) right away, for this project Team X has pre-uploaded the program to the Arduino for the client.  All of the outputs from the code are printed to a liquid crystal display (LCD) and saved on an SD card to track trends."
