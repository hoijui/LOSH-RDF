    okh:function "Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Technology is widely adopted electricity generation alternative due to its huge potential in harnessing solar energy as a renewable, reliable and sustainable source of electricity. Nepal receives around 300 days of sunshine in a year and possesses huge potential of hosting Grid Connected PV plants in Nepal's national grid which is primarily dominated by hydropower. This paper presents the technical details of proposed GCPV Project, based in Upper Mustang Region of Nepal, and discusses the challenges and their possible mitigating measures for such system in Nepalese Context. Further, buffer storage type GCPV is also analyzed to address the problem of power and frequency fluctuation caused by grid integration of such system.  Nepal receives solar irradiation in range of 3.6-6.2 kW h/m2/day, 4.7kW h/m2/day in average." ;
