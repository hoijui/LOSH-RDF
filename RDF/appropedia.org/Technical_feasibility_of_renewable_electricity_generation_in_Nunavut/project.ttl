    okh:function "All twenty-five communities in Nunavut are dependent on the use of imported diesel fuel for their electricity, which results in environmental, social and economic problems. This chapter critically analyzes the technical viability of renewable energy technologies (RETs) to mitigate some of the damage done by diesel in three case-study communities in Nunavut: Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, and Resolute Bay. RETs are screened for available data, potential energy output and economic impacts of RET systems of equivalent peak power to current diesel plants are determined using numerical simulation. These impacts are quantified for the RET system by:  percent of diesel generated energy saved, amount of diesel fuel reduced, the economic savings from unused diesel fuel, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential. The results are then discussed and conclusions are drawn about the specific RET viability of solar photovoltaic and wind power systems in Nunavut." ;
