function = "== Problem being addressed == Birth asphyxia is the third leading cause of neonatal death worldwide, fatally affecting about 900,000 newborns in developing countries each year. The high price and lack of reusability of certain devices make it hard for mothers to treat asphyxia in times of need.    == Detailed description of the solution == The Tekno-Tube is a cheap ($8), reusable alternative to more common ($30) neonatal resuscitation devices.  It consists of a long tube connected to a mask, which fits over a baby’s mouth.  A midwife can then blow air into the baby’s mouth, providing resuscitation."
