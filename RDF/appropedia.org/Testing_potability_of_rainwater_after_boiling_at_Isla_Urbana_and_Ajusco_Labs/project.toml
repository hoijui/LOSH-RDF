function = "Boiling is a common way of disinfecting water for drinking around the world. The length of boiling time changes not just based on elevation changes, but also based on personal judgments and personal work schedules. Though rainwater is relatively free of impurities there are still points of contamination including fecal material, which have shown up in some studies as coliforms above the recommended level for safe drinking water. This study will compare the effectiveness of E.coli removal at different boiling times from rainwater samples collected in real rainwater catchment systems set up by Isla Urbana in Mexico City. We will compare the effective removal of E.coli at different boiling times commonly used in the community and the boiling time suggested for our elevation at 8,000ft."
