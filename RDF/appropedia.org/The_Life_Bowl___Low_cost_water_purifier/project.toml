function = "One child dies every 14 seconds from waterborne a disease, which gives you two dead children as I finish typing this sentence. What's worse is most of these people survive on less than $2 per day. Vedika Jain, a senior at the Mallya Aditi International School, Bangalore was very intrigued by the growing research and innovation in this problem. After Tata came out with 'TATASwach'this year, apparently, the world's most cost-effective Water Filter, Vedika prototyped \" The Life Bowl\". Although only one prototype has been made so far, The \"Life bowl\", a transparent, instant purifier, contains the cheapest Nano carbon tube powder (embedded in the holes at the bottom of the bowl) above which is a layer of coconut husk ( virtually no cost) that helps in the filtration of polluted water."
