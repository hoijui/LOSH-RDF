    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Despite extremely high rates of HIV infection in women, there is currently no discrete method to prevent infection.    == Detailed description of the solution == The Microbicide Ring is a flexible, silicon vaginal ring that releases dapivirine slowly over the course of a month. Using matrix technology, the drug is evenly dispersed throughout the ring. After insertion, no further action is required by the user until a new ring must be inserted one month later. Similar rings are used in the United States for contraception to great effect, and studies have shown this method to be acceptable to both men and women in Kenya." ;
