    okh:function "The TEN Project is a London, UK based non-profit organisation created by Emmy nominated cinematographer John Tattersall, to aid the creation and implementation of both short and long term Sustainability solutions.  http://www.thetenproject.org   == The Project's Aim == To distribute a game in 2010 to every single ten-year-old living in the ten most influential mega-cities of the future, to inspire them to create a ten-year plan for redesigning their world into one that will be sustainable and worth inheriting in 2020.   == The Game's Aim == As the game Monopoly prepared previous generations for capitalism, this game aims to make lucrative sustainability second nature to the children of a new world in which biology and economics are inextricably linked.  The game aims to do this by exciting its players into creating a ten year plan for sustainability problem solving, empowering them as a connected global network, and alerting them to their major role in this next crucial ten years of human civilization. (Statistics quoted are courtesy of the UN, N.A.T.O., and WHO)    == WHY SUSTAINABILITY IS VITAL == IPCC reports reveal that the world has reached a state of emergency, and that during the next ten years we must bring to fruition the monumental advances in Green Technology, social innovation and human compassion that have already begun, if we are to survive." ;
