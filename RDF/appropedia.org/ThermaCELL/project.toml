function = "== Problem being addressed == Malaria mosquitos are common in wetlands, especially in rice growing regions and in cool shaded wooded areas and pools.  Individuals are in danger of being bitten by a malaria-carrying mosquito when in proximity to these types of landscapes.  For this reason, individuals can benefit from using a portable, non-toxic device that protects against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes.   == Detailed description of the solution == ThermaCELL is a portable, battery-less, non-toxic device that dispenses a small amount of heated mosquito repellent into the air over a long period of time. This device is powered by a butane cartridge which provides the cordless, portable heat necessary to vaporize the repellant, which mimics naturally occurring insecticide."
