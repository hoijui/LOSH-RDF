X 12 in. piece of aluminum (1/4 in. thick) • TEG module • Step up voltage converter (MAX756EPA+(joule thief) – 5VDC from 0.7 volts in • 12 V fan (too much, need a 5V) • Parallel board • Solder • Sterno • Thermal Paste • Fan • Heat sink • Car exhaust gasket • (2) springs (size 16)   == How to Build == How to Build a Thermal Phone Charger:   == Costs ==   == Conclusions == We installed a circuit board with the positive and negative terminals from the TEG module powering the step up converter and the fan.  We installed another terminal that went to the USB port for cell phone charging."
