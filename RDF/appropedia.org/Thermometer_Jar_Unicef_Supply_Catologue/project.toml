function = "must be printed in PP and tested in autoclave before mass use   == 3D Printable Thermometer Jar for UNICEF Supply Catalogue == Project developed by Zachary Verran   == Abstract == UNICEF's supply catalogue is used to acquire commodities to respond to the needs of children and their families worldwide. In this catalogue, there is a product for use as a thermometer jar. In the catalogue, it is specified what the jar is made out of, the dimensions of the jar, and what the jar needs to be capable of. In the catalogue, it specifies that the jar needs to be made of plastic (polypropylene) and be able to be autoclavable, which means it needs to have the ability to be steam cleaned and sterilized. Following the dimension guidelines set in the catalogue, a 3D model of a jar was created using OpenScad and then printed used a RepRap Athena Delta Bot printer."
