In this catalogue, there is a product for use as a thermometer jar. In the catalogue, it is specified what the jar is made out of, the dimensions of the jar, and what the jar needs to be capable of. In the catalogue, it specifies that the jar needs to be made of plastic (polypropylene) and be able to be autoclavable, which means it needs to have the ability to be steam cleaned and sterilized. Following the dimension guidelines set in the catalogue, a 3D model of a jar was created using OpenScad and then printed used a RepRap Athena Delta Bot printer." ;
