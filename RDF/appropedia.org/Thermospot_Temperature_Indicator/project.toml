function = "== Problem being addressed == Hypothermia is a leading cause of infant death in developing countries. Thermometers can be expensive and some require electricity or batteries, which can be a difficult burden on the user. There is currently no low-cost method for continuous monitoring of an infant's body temperature.   == Detailed description of the solution == Thermospot is a low-cost, reusable hypothermia indicator designed particularly for use by illiterate mothers. It is a small, flexible sticker with a smiley face to be applied to the infant or child's skin."
