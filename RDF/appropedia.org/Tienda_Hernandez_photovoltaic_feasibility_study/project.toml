function = "Jose Leandro Hernandez, a local grocer in Parras, Coahuila MX, is interested in harnessing the ample year-round sunshine that Parras receives to power his store. The grocer is willing to invest in a photovoltaic system, but first needs to determine the economic feasibility of the project. Our goal was to design a system suited to the grocerÂ´s needs and conduct a thorough study to determine the feasibility of the project.   === Photovoltaic Feasibility Study for Local Grocer ===  We first designed a stand-alone system and found that the payback time is more than 25 years (the expected life of the system). We then designed a grid intertie system with a payback of 11 years.\nmeasure feasibility"
