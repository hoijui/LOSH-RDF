function = "One day, I saw a bunch of old tires used as a retaining wall and that got me thinking about what other uses old tires are good for. I had a few thoughts about what to make but I liked the idea of tire shingles the best. The fact that they would be malleable really hooked me. I couldn't wait to get started!   == Information on Tires ==  The fabric of the tire is steel, nylon, aramid fiber, rayon, fiberglass, or polyester combination."
