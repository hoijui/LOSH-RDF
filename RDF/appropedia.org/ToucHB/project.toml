function = "== Problem being addressed == Detecting anemia is crucial to curbing maternal and neonatal mortality, however, conventional, and often expensive and fragile, diagnostic mechanisms are not compatible with low-resource settings as they require electrical support and skilled healthcare workers.    == Detailed description of the solution == ToucHB is a cost-effective, handheld, and non-invasive hemoglobin level scanner, which in combination with an accompanying chart, allows health workers to accurately and easily diagnose anemia in a variety of settings. The device shines light of different wavelengths through the tissue of the patient’s finger and determines the hemoglobin concentration in the tissue based on hemoglobin’s characteristic absorbance. ToucHB is durable and is supported by a rechargeable battery and a hand crank mechanism. Efforts are underway to integrate the technology with mobile devices using platforms such as Android, and the hardware is also being refined to be smaller and faster."
