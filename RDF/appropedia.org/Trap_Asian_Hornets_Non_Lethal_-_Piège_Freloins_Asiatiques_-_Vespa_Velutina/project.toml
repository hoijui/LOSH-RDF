function = "I had been thinking for a long time about a selective and non-lethal trap against the Asian hornets that hurt beekeepers. The idea came to me following a presentation of a bone prosthesis made by a 3D printer. The first step, with other steps in parallel, was to learn a software worthy of the name to create prototypes. I'm talking about \"Fusion 360\". Following beginner's courses from Lars Christensen, the schematics for the parts came to life very quickly.\nApiculture"
