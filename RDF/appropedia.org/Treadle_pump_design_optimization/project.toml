function = "Treadle Pumps are widely used globally -- need to tie design to those that have been further developed. The treadle is a very simple design that is used to produce rotary or reciprocating motion in a machine, which dates back to Thomas Saintâ€™s original sewing machine design he had patented in 1790 and earlier. This basic component can be used in many simple machines, including grinders and pumps. A treadle pump is defined as a foot operated single acting double cylinder piston pump for low lift irrigation . Pumping is activated by stepping up and down on the treadles to drive the attached pistons, creating suction in the cylinder that draws groundwater to the surface ."
