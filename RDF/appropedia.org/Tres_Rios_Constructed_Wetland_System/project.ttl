    okh:function "The Tres Rios constructed wetlands project on the west outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona, which was just completed and fully operational since 2010, was both funded by the private and federal sectors. The project consists of an extensive environmental restoration of an 8-mile portion of the Salt River confluence with the Gila and Agua Fria rivers (3 confluent river basins). The purpose of the development was to construct a regulating artificial wetland that would mitigate differences of effluence from the main local water treatment plant and in addition to reestablish a large amount of habitat for native vegetation and regional biodiversity. Complete, the development involved the construction of approx. 128 acres of wetlands, 38 acres of riparian corridors, 134 acres of open water/marsh areas, and about 69 acres of habitat." ;
