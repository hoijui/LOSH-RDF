Drug resistance occurs as a result of the incomplete or incorrect use of antibiotics in the treatment of patients with tuberculosis.  In order to increase compliance with tuberculosis drug regimens and improve outcomes in developing countries, the uBox Electronic Pillbox reminds patients when to take their medication and tracks their history for healthcare workers to evaluate at the conclusion of a treatment cycle.   == Detailed description of the solution == The uBox is unique among uNotify devices because it enables patients to take medication themselves.
