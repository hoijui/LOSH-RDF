    okh:function "By: Stuart Jones & Erin Haugen  This page describes natural insulation from recycled paper (Cellulose) to wool and cotton batts among other types which we define as containing less than 10% petrolium products (oils, resins, and plastics). We'll compare the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of each type. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of natural in home insulation products that are free of formaldehyde and other toxic chemicals. You're either starting your building from scratch and have a choice of insulation to use, or the desire to increase an already standing building while not increasing the amount of harmful VOCs coming from some traditional insulation. A natural insulator might be the an appealing option." ;
