function = "An ongoing project designed and implemented at Universidad Tecnológica de Coahuila in Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila México to provide safe drinking water purified by the process of solar distillation. Summer 2006:  Angela Crane Jeff Kinzer   === Purpose === Numerous different methods exist for purifying water, all with the same intended result: to obtain water that is safe for humans to drink, referred to as potable. Some of the most common methods of water purification are boiling, addition of chemicals (iodine or chlorine), reverse osmosis, and filtration. All of these methods are effective, but may require resources that are unavailable in some locations. For example, while it may be very difficult to obtain chemicals or maintain a fire in remote areas, sunlight is often a readily available resource usable for water distillation.\nwater purification"
