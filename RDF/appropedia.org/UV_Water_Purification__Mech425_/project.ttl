    okh:function "This project aims to design, create, test and evaluate a zero cost solar disinfection (SODIS) water purification method which could help provide safe drinking water to those who do not have access to clean water sources. The end goal is a simple, language-free document which could be distributed to people in third world countries, in a format which is easy to understand, and a design which is simple and easy to manufacture with little to no cost. The design presented will be for a single cell of the system, which could easily be set up in parallel for higher water purification rates. A larger version of the single cell could also be created if the materials are available, again allowing for higher rates of water purification. Download the Language-free Clean Water Guide:  The Guide summarizes this article in a one page, language-free medium which could hopefully be understood by anybody on the planet." ;
