    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == Waterborne diseases are some of the leading causes of death for children in the developing world and result in an enormous amount of productivity loss for adults throughout the developing world. Clean tap water in these countries is not guaranteed to be potable or not cause harm. In places with rainy seasons, such as India, the flooding can cause even greater contamination of water sources.   == Detailed description of the solution == The “UV Waterworks” device is a small-scale, low-maintenance design that purifies water (deactivating viral and bacterial contamination) through the use of ultra violet light. Water is disinfected by using the equivalent of a 40-Watt lightbulb at a cost of 2 cents per ton of water treated." ;
