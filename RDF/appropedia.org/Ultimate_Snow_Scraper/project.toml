function = "This project aims to fill the need for a small item that can be placed in a car, which serves the purpose of clearing snow and large ice from windows. Typically, cars would just have one snow scraper which the driver needs to be able to scrape across the windshield, but there are numerous windows that also need to be cleaned off. Instead of forcing one person in a car to clean all the windows, this project provides a simple solution which will allow the passengers and drivers to clear snow off the windows with ease. For the price of $1 per scraper, this ultimate scraper can clear large sheets of ice and snow with ease. Components are still being printed, images coming very soon."
