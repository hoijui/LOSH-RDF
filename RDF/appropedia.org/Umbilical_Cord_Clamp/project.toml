function = "'   == Umbilical Cord Clamps == Project developed by User:Jayantchalke   == Abstract == Many times people in the developing countries are faced the problem of accessing medical devices due to the unavailability/ shortage of the device or the inefficient and corrupt local import systems [1] Open source 3D Printing of these devices is a boon to the people in developing countries where they can print the devices and directly use in the clinics. This OpenSource Appropriate Technology used in Manufacturing Umbilical Cord Clamp is one such step in providing a relatively cheap and quick access to the medical devices in developing countries.  3D printing of Umbilical Cord clamps was initiated by Ashley Dara in Haiti where she has empowered local Haitians with the power of 3D printer and skilled them with Opensource 3D modelling software to design and explore various potentials of 3D printing opportunities in their surroundings.   == Bill of Materials == PLA Filament ~ 22$  [2] Painters Tape/ Washable Glue/ Sharp Knife   == Source Code Files == File:Umbilical Cord Clamp (STL File) .stl File:Umbilical Cord Clamp (SCAD File).scad   == Tools needed ==  MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == MY4777/MY5777/EE4777/EE5777: Open-source 3-D printing.
