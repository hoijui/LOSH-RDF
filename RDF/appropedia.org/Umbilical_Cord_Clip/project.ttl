    okh:function "== Umbilical Cord Clip == Project developed by Nicolas Winkler [[[User:Nicolas Winkler|Nicolas Winkler]] (talk) 06:44, 8 December 2015 (PST)]   == Abstract == Easy to print and cost effective umbilical cord clip.  This clip can easily be printed and used for a new born baby. Most clips use a latch to keep shut, by realizing that you can slide an umbilical cord down the channels of my clip you can firmly clip a cord.   == Bill of Materials == 1.5 grams of PLA Upload and link to all source files from open source CAD Upload and link to all STLs Simple Umbilical Cord Clip   == Tools needed ==  MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Considerations == Umbilical cords have no nerve endings so a slight pinching from the channels on the cord will not cause discomfort. The cords take 1 to 2 weeks to fall off, once off the clip can be easily removed." ;
