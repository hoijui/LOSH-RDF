function = "== Problem being addressed == HIV/AIDS is an extreme health threat in much of the developing world. To diagnose HIV, blood samples are often required to be sent to a central laboratory to be processed, which is time-consuming and costly.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Uni-Gold HIV rapid HIV test is a rapid diagnostic test that enables HIV to be diagnosed at the point of care. During testing, plasma or whole blood is applied to the sample port, and antibodies speciÔ¨Åc to the recombinant HIV-1 or HIV-2 proteins will react with the colloidal gold-linked antigens. A positive reaction is visualized by a pink/red band in the test region of the device."
