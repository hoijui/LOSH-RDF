function = "== Problem being addressed == In the developing world, needles in a medical setting are often reused due to the scarcity of resources.  However, reusing old (and possibly contaminated) needles increases the risk of HIV transmission.  There was a need for a single-use, safe syringe in order to ensure safe injections.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Uniject is a single-use needle, designed with a pre-filled drug delivery container that cannot be refilled.  This type of needle is effective in preventing \"needle sharing\" because it can only be used once and provides a sterile injection each time."
