    okh:function "== MOST Delta Performance Mod == Project developed by Alicia Steele   		   == Abstract == The majority of early print failures I encountered were results of the filament not spooling into the printer correctly.  Possible failures include tangling and breaking of filament.  If the filament becomes tangled enough, or even crossed over on the spool, when the spool is mounted external to the printer a special case of problem is created.  As the extruder motor tries to feed filament in, the printer can be dragged toward the entangled filament and eventually by dragged off the table...falling melzi board first towards the floor.    In order to prevent this disaster I wanted a filament spooler that was attached to the printer, and that could easily accomodate different types of spools." ;
