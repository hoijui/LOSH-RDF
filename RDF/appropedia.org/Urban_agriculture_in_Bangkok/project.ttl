    okh:function "In early 2000, urban gardens were started in Bangkok under the direction of the NGO, Thailand Environment Institute (TEI). Bangkok has a population of 12 million, and 39% of the land in the city vacant due to rapid expansion of the 1960's to 80's. The two urban gardens initiated by TEI are in Bangkok Noi and Bangkapi and the stated main tasks were to:  Teach members of the communities the benefits of urban green space. Create the social framework to plan, implement, and maintain the urban green space. Create a process of method to balance the needs of the community with the needs of the larger environmental concerns." ;
