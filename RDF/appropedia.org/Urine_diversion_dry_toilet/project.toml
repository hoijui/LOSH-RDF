function = "A Urine Diverting Dry Toilet (UDDT) is a toilet that operates without water and has a divider so that the user, with little effort can divert the urine away from the faeces. The UDDT toilet is built such that urine is collected and drained from the front area of the toilet, while faeces fall through a large chute (hole) in the back. Depending on the Collection and Storage/Treatment technology that follows, drying material such as lime, ash or earth should be added into the same hole after defecating. Men, as well as women, need to sit while urinating to ensure that the urine is diverted into the correct channel. It is important that the two sections of the toilet are well separated to ensure that a) faeces do not fall into, and clog the urine collection area in the front, and that b) urine does not splash down into the dry area of the toilet."
