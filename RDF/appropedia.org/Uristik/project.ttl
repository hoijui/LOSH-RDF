    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == People with diabetes and hypertension are at risk for developing microalbuminuria which is a condition defined by an abnormally high level of the albumin protein in urine (between 30 to 300 mg/day).  In a healthy person, the presence of albumin is rarely found in the urine (less than 30 mg/day) because it is normally retained in the bloodstream by the kidneys.  Albuminuria could lead to diabetic nephropathy, damaging the nerves in the body due to high blood sugar levels, as well as cause cardiac complications. To prevent vascular damage, constant monitoring is necessary to check for microalbuminaruia.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device makes it possible to test for microalbuminuria in urine samples." ;
