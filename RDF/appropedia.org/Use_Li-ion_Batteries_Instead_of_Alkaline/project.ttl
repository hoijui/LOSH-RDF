    okh:function "Use (recycled) Lithium Ion Batteries instead of Alkaline (AA, AAA, C, etc) for consumer electronics. Electric/electronic devices, designed to run on 3 volts (traditionally 2 AA, AAA, C, D alkaline batteries), are quite prolific around the world. Some devices are troublesome to swap batteries on - the time/date must be re-set, or they may be in a difficult to access location. Some devices are designed to operate on 3 volts minimum, and don't work well at all on the 2.4v output from a pair of traditional rechargeable batteries. In this case, users are forced to continue buying and discarding/recycling single-use alkaline batteries." ;
