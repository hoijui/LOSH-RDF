function = "It is possible to use contaminant transport analysis software along with computational fluid dynamics software such as CFD0 to estimate the effectiveness of possible household air quality interventions. Doing this has the potential to reduce cost by reducing the need to conduct expensive field testing.   == Basic Process == The basic procedure to create a computational model to evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed household air quality intervention is as follows:  Download and install the appropriate software packages."
