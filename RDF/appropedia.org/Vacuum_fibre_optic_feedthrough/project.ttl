    okh:function "Current market options used to pass a fibre from a vacuum environment to an ambient pressure environment use a complex, hermetically sealed, tube that houses a segment of fibre that passes through the vacuum interface. Whilst effective, these designs are expensive with high leadtimes, as they require precisely machined parts, and lack flexibility as an entirely new device needs to be manufactured if the fibre type needs to be changed. Here we outline the fabrication of a simple, and cheap, vacuum feedthrough that is compatible with every fibre optic type. Our system has the additionally advantage that, changing the fibre type, length, structure or any other design consideration is simple and quick and does not require re-manufacturing of the feedthrough system.   == Understanding the market == Current market options are based on a hermetically sealed fibre housing." ;
