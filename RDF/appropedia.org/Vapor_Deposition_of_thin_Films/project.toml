function = "Vapor Deposition is a processing method to lay a thin layer of a precursor material onto a substrate material to improve its mechanical and chemical properties. Vapor deposition is categorized into two major subdivisions of processing:  (1) Chemical Vapor DepositionW (CVD) (2) Physical Vapor DepositionW (PVD) Vapor Deposition is an atomistic process in which aprecursorW material is vaporized from a solid or gaseous precursor material and transported in a vacuum in the form of excited atoms or molecules and deposited on a substrateWmaterial where it condenses and is deposited as a thin film. Vapor Deposition was originally 'coined by the authors CF Powell, JH Oxley and JM Blocher Jr. in their 1966 book \"Vapor Deposition\". The fundamental theory behind vapor deposition roots from theoretical physics,chemistry and thermodynamics and the actual deposition process was developed with advancements in vacuum technology, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics and fluid flow[2]."
