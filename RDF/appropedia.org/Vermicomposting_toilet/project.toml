function = "We have been intrigued with a unique style of composting toilet which is in use by some members of the natural building community. It combines two tried and tested principles of organic gardening: vermicomposting and moldering (i.e., low temperature) composting toilets. Although I have never used one, I am told that it works well. In order to further this idea we have researched one installation and are attaching simple plans for construction. The basic idea is to create a friendly habitat for worms and keep them continuously supplied with food."
