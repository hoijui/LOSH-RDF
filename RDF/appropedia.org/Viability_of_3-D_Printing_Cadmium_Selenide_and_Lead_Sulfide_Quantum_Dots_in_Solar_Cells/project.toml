function = "Quantum dots (QD) are nanoparticles comprised of semiconductor materials, which exhibit enhanced electronic properties over bulk materials. These properties are defined by a highly adjustable structure of the quantum dot that yields enormous potential in many applications, including photovoltaic cells. A solar cell (also called a photovoltaic cell) is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect. It is a form of photoelectric cell (in that its electrical characteristics—e.g. current, voltage, or resistance—vary when light is incident upon it) which, when exposed to light, can generate and support an electric current without being attached to any external voltage source."
