function = "To create a full model of a 3-D printable piezoresistive sensor in order to detect the amount of impact that an athlete receives during a collision to monitor the possibility of a concussion. With professional sporting leagues such as the National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL) adding an emphasis on player safety, especially with head injuries, it is important to have a quick and reliable way to determine the amount of force a helmet receives during a collision. This information can help determine if the player sustained a concussion and if they should be taken out of the game to protect themselves. The data that is gathered throughout games can also be accumulated and help to try and make rules that help determine if new rules are necessary to protect players in the future. The typical acceleration that is required to sustain a concussion is about 95 g-forces."
