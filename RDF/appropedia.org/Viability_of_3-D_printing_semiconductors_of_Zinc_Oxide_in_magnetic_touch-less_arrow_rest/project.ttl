    okh:function "Bowhunting is a tradition that many Americans take part in every year. There are many types of bows used for hunting such as the crossbow, long bow and the most popular, the compound bow. The compound bow is often preferred over long bows due to improved accuracy and arrow speed. Crossbows are often limited to those unable to use a traditional long or compound bows but still want to be able to hunt. A picture of a compound bow can be found in Figure 1." ;
