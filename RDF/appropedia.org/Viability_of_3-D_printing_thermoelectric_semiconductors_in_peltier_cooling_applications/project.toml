function = "The Peltier effect occurs when current flows between two dissimilar conductors or semiconductors. When this occurs, the charge carriers flowing through the material will transfer heat from one side to the other, allowing this effect to be used to create a heat pump. The power (heat per unit time) generated by the effect can be calculated by the following equation: [math]\\displaystyle{ P = (\\Pi_{A} - \\Pi_{B})I }[/math] where [math]\\displaystyle{ \\Pi_{A} }[/math] and [math]\\displaystyle{ \\Pi_{B} }[/math] are the Peltier coefficients of the two materials and I is the electrical current.Thus it can be seen that the power of the device is dependent on the difference between the Peltier coefficients of the two materials.  The Seebeck effect The Seebeck effect is a variation of the Peltier effect and is essentially the same process carried out in reverse. When two dissimilar conductors or semiconductors are connected and are at different temperatures, a voltage between them will be created.The Seebeck coefficient can be calculated using the following equation: [math]\\displaystyle{ S_{A} - S_{B} = \\Delta V/ \\Delta T }[/math] where SA and SB are the Seebeck coefficients of the two materials, [math]\\displaystyle{ \\Delta V }[/math] is the voltage difference, and [math]\\displaystyle{ \\Delta T }[/math] is the temperature difference."
