    okh:function "For the manufacturing of quantum dot LED (QLED) displays, the quantum dots will have been created prior to 3D printing. The quantum dots will be made of the semiconductor, cadmium selenide/zinc sulfide (CdSe/ZnS), which consists of CdSe core and a ZnS shell. The ZnS shell on the quantum dot acts as a protective barrier between the core, which is responsible for optical emission, and the surrounding material. Four sizes of quantum dots corresponding to four colors (red, yellow, orange, green) of emitted light will be purchased from mkNano. The smallest quantum dots will be purchased from Sigma-Aldrich since mknano did not offer CdSe/ZnS quantum dots in the size range that will emit blue light." ;
