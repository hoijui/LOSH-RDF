    okh:function "The purpose of this page is to outline the process of 3D-printing organic semiconductors to prototype a photovoltaic sticker that can be adhered and that will supply power to a number of electronic devices. The photovoltaic effect, organic semiconductor properties & synthesization , and 3D-printing of the solar cell will be outlined. Furthermore, an OpenSCAD model for the rapid prototyping of the product will be introduced and the applications explained.   == Photovoltaic Cells ==   === Photovoltaic Effect === The photovoltaic effect is a response between two different materials to radiation. When the materials are irradiated, the response creates a potential difference where the materials meet." ;
