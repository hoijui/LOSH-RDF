function = "This is a speculative class project and needs to be refined before being deployed at any scale.  In 1968, scientists, Robert Noyce and Gordon MooreW, founded Intel with a vision for semiconductor memory products. By 1971, they had introduced the world's first microprocessor.   ===== Type of Semiconductor and How it's Made =====  Intel processors use 99.9999% pure silicon to make their wafers. The silicon is grown from melt into a large single crystal ingot."
