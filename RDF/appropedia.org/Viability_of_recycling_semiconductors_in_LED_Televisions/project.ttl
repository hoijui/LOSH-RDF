This project is centered around the recycling process of the semiconductors in LED televisions, and how it could be improved upon. The brand of televisions focused upon is produced by LG Electronics of South Korea. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are a semiconductor based lighting device that are quickly becoming the industry standard for many applications. One of the most popular applications is backlighting for liquid crystal display (LCD) panels." ;
