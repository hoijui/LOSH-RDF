    okh:function "This is a speculative class project and needs to be refined before being deployed at any scale.  A Pacemaker  is a surgically implanted battery operated device used to bypass the \"cardiac conduction system where a local or a global malfunction is found\". Basically, pacemakers help normalize abnormal heart rates in patients with those types of issues. Since pacemakers are implanted in patients, size is a huge concern that, presently, is much less of a problem because of the shrinking size of the semiconductor devices used in the pacemakers, which provide the internal clock used to regulate the electric pulses that moderate heart rate in patients. Pacemakers are implanted into patients just below the skin and are located near to the heart." ;
