function = "This is a speculative class project and needs to be refined before being deployed at any scale.  In recent years the application of digital imaging devices has seen an exponential growth in the technological, industrial, and entertainment sectors, while continuing to pervade other fields once thought impossible. Since the late 1960s, this boom has been spurred by advancements in the two main image sensor technologies, CCDW (charge-coupled device) and CMOSW (complementary metal oxide semiconductor). Both imaging technologies utilize a rectangular array of millions of photosites, which capture photons and convert the charge of the electrons produced via the photoelectric effect in a silicon photodiode substrate into an analog signal. The method of converting this signal to digital and the subsequent read out is what differs between these two types of sensors."
