    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == The use of ultrasound machines is a common, non-invasive way to diagnose a variety of cardiovascular diseases.  However, the expense of one of these machines, plus the cost to operate and maintain it, is not an option for most developing countries.  Additionally, a trained technician is necessary for operation.  There is a need for an alternative method to diagnose cardiovascular diseases.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Vscan is a small, handheld device that is the size of a smartphone with powerful ultrasound technology." ;
