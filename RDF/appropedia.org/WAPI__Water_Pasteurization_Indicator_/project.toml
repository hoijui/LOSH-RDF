function = "The WAPI (Water Pasteurization Indicator) is a reusable, inexpensive thermometer employing a plug of soybean wax which melts at 68˚C, just above the 65˚C or 149˚F pasteurization temperature for water or milk, at which point all disease-causing organisms (bacteria, viruses, and parasites) are killed. Since the water is not heated all the way to boiling, and merely reaches the pasteurization temperature, time is saved and less fuel is consumed.   == Construction and use == The hydrogenated soybean oil called Myverol 18-06 K (a food-grade emulsifier powdered wax) is encased in a small clear plastic tube, weighted with a metal washer. Fishing line or wire suspends the WAPI toward the bottom of the water container (where the water is coolest). The WAPI is oriented with the wax plug at its top, but after melting the wax flows to the bottom part."
