function = "This project is about a wagon for walking with solar panels. In the project \"A sustainable walkabout from Ystad to Stockholm with the global goals and open data\" a stroller was rebuilt to carry the payload and some solar panels. This page documents how it was built.   == Understanding the market == For a long walk (>1,000 km) a backpack is not enough to carry all essential camping gear. Add to it the need to work remotely, you end up with too much to carry at all."
