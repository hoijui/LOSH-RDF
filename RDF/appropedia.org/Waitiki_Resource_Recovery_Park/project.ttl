    okh:function "\"[Intended to] optimize the amount of material diverted from landfill to beneficial uses through Community ownership of our resource streams1\".   === About === The Waitaki Resource Recovery Park is a community-owned program that has been operating in the Waitaki District of New Zealand since 2002. This innovative program works to help divert materials that could possibly be reused or recycled away from the district's landfills. As of 2009, the Park has diverted 2,395 tons of material, about 74% of its total volume, and has an annual turnover of over $1 million2. The Park is primarily self-funded but also relies on supportive funding from the Waitaki District Council." ;
