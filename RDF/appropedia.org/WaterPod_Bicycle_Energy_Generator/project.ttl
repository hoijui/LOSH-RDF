    okh:function "As the need for renewable energy has become more apparent to the concerned public, we have discovered ways to wean ourselves off our dependence of fossil fuels and nuclear power. Our team has designed an alternative way to convert kinetic energy to AC power by means of a bicycle energy generator. With this, the WaterPod as well as others can use our design to generate their own electricity.   == Abstract == The Bicycle Energy Generator will use kinetic energy supplied through a mechanical system and return usable DC power by means of a direct current energy generator. Direct current will then run through an electrical circuit and eventually be stored in a bank of marine batteries." ;
