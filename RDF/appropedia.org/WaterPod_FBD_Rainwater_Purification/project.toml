function = "The WaterPod is a project based out of New York designed to be a sustainable, navigable living space, showcasing the critical importance of the environment and serves as a model for new living technologies. It is currently scheduled to launch in New York in May, 2009, navigate down the East River, explore the waters of New York Harbor, and stopping at each of the five boroughs it will dock at several Manhattan piers on the Hudson River. However, The WaterPod needed help developing several aspects of its design, including the processing of drinking water without outside help. To this end, The WaterPod contacted CSU Humboldt State University's Engineering 215 class. The Fire Breathing Dragons (FBD) are a group of students from Humboldt State University's Engineering 215 class who have developed a system for filtering rainwater based on the WaterPod's needs."
