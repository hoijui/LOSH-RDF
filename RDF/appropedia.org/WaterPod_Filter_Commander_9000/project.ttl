The project started as a request for a water filtration system for the WaterPod project, and went through a five-stage design process before ending up as the Filter Commander 9000. This page is designed to show its progression from design to construction to use, and to present information for those who may want to replicate the system.   == Background ==  The WaterPod Project started as a demonstration of a self-sustaining community, which would have a minimal environmental impact, and have its residents use sustainable methods of living. Their community is built entirely on a refurbished barge, and as such will be isolated from most modern utilities, such as the electrical grid and water supply.
