function = "The M2-B2 Rocket Stove promotes sustainability through demonstration and education while on the WaterPod in New York City. The stove is designed to provide a reliable and sustainable means of cooking by minimizing fuel use and optimizing efficiency. The WaterPod had five artists living on a barge in New York for five months trying to get all their energy, water, and food from the barge itself. The WaterPod traveled by river promoting sustainability and climate change awareness, The barge stopped in all five boroughs of New York encouraging the public to tour the barge and join in classes, events, and workshops. The WaterPod worked with the Engineering 215 - Intro to Design class at Humboldt State University to create sustainable projects."
