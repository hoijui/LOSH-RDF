function = "The WaterPod project based in New York city, consisting of a group of artist, decided to attempt to design, build, and have five people live on a self-sufficient, as possible, barge for a period of six months. Our Team, along with other teams from our Engineering 215 class at Humboldt State University, were given a list of problems that needed to be addressed. Some of these problems were food, clean water, electricity, and waste management. Each team was given a task, which they were to research, design, and build a system that completes the task given. Once completed, the projects were shipped to New York, where they were implemented on the WaterPod's barge~(Plan as of 5/5/09)."
