function = "This page is about the \"Tour De Volts\" project for the WaterPod from the Spring 2009 \"Introduction to Design\" class at Humboldt State University. We propose to use a bicycle as a power source to provide a bit of extra energy to the WaterPod. Specifically, we've used a bike trainer to convert a DC motor from a scooter into an electrical generator. This will be on the WaterPod for six months and will serve as an educational tool.   == Introduction ==   === The Waterpod Project === The Waterpod is a self sustaining barge that will float down the East River of New York City, docking at several different Manhattan piers on the Hudson River to teach the public about sustainability."
