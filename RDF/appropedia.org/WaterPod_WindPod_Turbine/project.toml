function = "The WindPod Turbine is a vertical axis wind turbine that uses the power of the wind to create energy which is then stored in the 12V battery banks.   == Background == The WaterPod Project [1] is a art exhibition and a learning experience that will teach people about alternative solutions to environmental problems and sustainability. The barge will travel around the five burrows in New York harbor with a group of artists living aboard it. The barge will attempt to be completely self sufficient and will stop and each of the five burrows for a period of about two weeks and let people on board to learn about sustainability and alternative solutions. Team MSB was a group created by the Engr."
