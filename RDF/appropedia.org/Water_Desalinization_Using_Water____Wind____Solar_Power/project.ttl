    okh:function "Design a Scalable Water Desalinization Plant [expansion needed] Water in dry areas is a problem.  Often these areas border the ocean which is an obvious source of water if only we could get the salt out.  Renewable energy is usually available in multiple forms since arid regions usually have a plentiful supply of solar energy.  Wind energy is usually plentiful where oceans and deserts meet and the ocean can provide both wave and current based power.   == Understanding the market == Many people could benefit from this who live in dry areas or areas underserved by water supply systems." ;
