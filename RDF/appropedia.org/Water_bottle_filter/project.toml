function = "== Title of the device or system ==  Project developed by Benjamin Joseph Btjoseph (talk) 16:57, 5 December 2018 (PST)   == Abstract == Many developing third-world countries have a steady or increasing need for clean drinking water. Many solutions for achieving clean drinking water already exist, but require expensive manufacturing equipment outside the area where there is a need, and then incur shipping charges to ship them to the target location. 3D printing technologies allow rapid manufacture of humanitarian-aid devices such as water purification tools. This printable design requires some filament (preferable ABS), a tea bag, and activated carbon to create. This allows the user to drink filtered water on-demand from and standard plastic water or pop bottle."
