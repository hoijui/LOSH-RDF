    okh:function "My water bottle stripper is designed to use discarded water bottles to make strong lengths of plastic cordage that can then be used for anything that requires high strength Cord. This design is potentially very useful in developing countries because water bottle waste is something that is plentiful throughout the world and that waste can then be converted into cordage. Not only will this provide a valuable, and versatile resource, it will also help in reducing pollution caused by plastic bottle waste.  Ian Armesy Ian Armesy's 3D Printing Page   == Bill of Materials == In addition to the tools to print this part and the falament material used, for this design to be functional all that is required is a standard razor blade.   == Tools needed == Jellybox or similar RepRap 3-D printer 1.75mm PLA falament   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Print each part of this assembly separately." ;
