function = "== Water Bottle to Sippy Cup Bottle Topper == Project developed by [megandersen]   == Abstract == My Open Source Appropriate Technology project is a water bottle cap modified to turn any water bottle into a sippy cup. Sippy cups are helpful to young children as they serve as a kind of \"training cup\" when learning how to use a real glass. Sippy cups are helpful in that parents spend less time cleaning up spills and the baby practices drinking liquids at a faster pace than a bottle but not as fast as an open cup. Sippy cups are also helpful because they help the child develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Sippy cups can be purchased for $5 or more but they generally aren't available at all small, local stores."
