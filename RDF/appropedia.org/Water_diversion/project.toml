function = "A primary purpose of many dams, both large and small, is to facilitate water diversions. Although existing water supplies can be stretched much further and new water infrastructure can be delayed using water conservation and efficiency strategies described below, people will continue to divert water from rivers and other surface sources for various purposes. Nearly 80 percent of water consumed in the United States comes from surface suppliesâ€”rivers, creeks and lakes. In California alone, there are more than 25,000 points of diversion from streams. Thus, there are at least 25,000 locations in the state at which fish and other river organisms can be harmed in the process of meeting our need for water."
