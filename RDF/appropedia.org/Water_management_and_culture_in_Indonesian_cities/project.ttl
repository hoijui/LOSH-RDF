Chriswaterguy talk) Year: 1997   == Preface to open release, 2006 == This thesis was primarily a learning experience for myself - I make no great claims that I have come up with original insights. However, I hope that in spite of that, the work I put in it might be of use to somebody else.   == Abstract == This work examines the impact of cultural factors upon the management of water and wastewater in urban Indonesia, with a particular focus on the dominant Javanese culture. The key cultural factors of relevance to development are:  The pre-eminence of relationships, as opposed to tasks." ;
