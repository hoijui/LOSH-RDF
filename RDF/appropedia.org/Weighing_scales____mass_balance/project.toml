function = "A simple Roberval measuring scale design that can be adjusted to support different weight multiples. By design, the exact positioning of the masses on the scales does not affect the comparison of weights, unlike a simpler lever-type scale.   == Bill of Materials == The parts can be obtained from the following source at Youmagine: [1] Each part should be printed off once, except for the vbar.stl and platform.stl files, which should be printed twice. Optionally, glue can be used to fasten the parts more securely together. If the printer prints tight tolerances, sandpaper would not be amiss."
