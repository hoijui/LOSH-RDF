function = "WetLand is an art installation on the Delaware River, for more information visit the Appropedia page: WetLand. WetLand is supplied with electricity by solar panels connected to four 12v batteries. The amount of sunlight and arrangement of batteries will affect the amount energy the system can produce. The amount of electricity stored in the batteries will change daily due to the varying concentrations of sunlight as well as the amount of loads(light bulbs, water pumps, laptops, etc.). It is important that the inhabitants of WetLand are informed on the state of the batteries as well as the amount of electricity being produced in order to accommodate their use accordingly."
