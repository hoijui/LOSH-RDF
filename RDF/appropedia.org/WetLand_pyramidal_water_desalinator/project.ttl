    okh:function "It's Always Sunny worked with Mary Mattingly, an artist based in New York City. She is collaborating with Live Arts/Fringe to design the WetLand project. Our objective is to design a long lasting desalination system that produces distilled water from the Delaware River for the inhabitants of the barge. The desalination system will promote sustainability through inspirational design and compliment the overall theme of the barge.  It's Always Sunny's solution and final design is a pyramidal solar still called The Great Pyramid of Philadelphia." ;
