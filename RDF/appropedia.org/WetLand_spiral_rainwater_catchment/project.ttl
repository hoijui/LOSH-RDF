    okh:function "The Replenish Life Team, Malia Sierra Breeze Gonzales and Neftali Eunice Romero, have created a rainwater catchment system that is intended to provide potable water for two to ten people that will be living on a barge. The barge is where the WetLand Project will be implemented on, and is a collaborative project between Live Arts/Fringe, Mary Mattingly, and Humboldt State Fall 2013 Engineering 215 Students. The components needed to build a rainwater catchment system for safe potable use are: a catchment system, a filtration system, a purification system, and a storage system. The Replenish Life Team intends to describe, on this webpage, the steps required to build and maintain a rainwater catchment system for the WetLand Project.   == Background ==  The WetLand Project is collaboration between Live Arts/Fringe, Mary Mattingly, and Humboldt State University Engineering 215 students." ;
