This is an iterative article, feel free to update with as many viable ideas as possible. The article aims to list a wide number of possibilities of things to do with unwanted pallets. Either be inspired to make the suggested items or to build on these ideas and create something completely new and as yet unthought of. If you have some instructions to share, please make a link from the suggestions here to a new article on Appropedia that will help people to transform the pallet from junk to useful." ;
