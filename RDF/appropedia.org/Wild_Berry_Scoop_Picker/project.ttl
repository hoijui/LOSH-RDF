    okh:function "== Wild Berry Scoop Picker == Project developed by User:Sswade   == Abstract == Berry pickers are useful for picking lots of berries at once instead of having to pick each berry by hand. When designing this picker the goal was to use the least amount of materials possible and also use materials that are easy to find. This berry picker is designed to fit onto gallon-sized milk jugs. The milk jug is used as the receptacle for the berries and as the handle. The 3d printed comb fits on and attaches with 3d printed pegs or any 3mm cylindrical object you have laying around." ;
