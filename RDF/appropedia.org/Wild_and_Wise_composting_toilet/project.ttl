    okh:function "Organic farms speak to the conventions of the modern world, and the way we eat our food. How the farmers on these CSAs go to the bathroom also speaks to these conventions. The composting toilet at Wild & Wise, which is a result of this project, serves to say, \"our waste is valuable, and should not be wasted.\" This project outlines the basic components of composting human waste, as well as ways to make your own composting toilet.   == Background ==  Wild and Wise is a developing herb CSA farm located in Arcata, California. The herbalists, educators, students, and farmers at Wild and Wise are dedicated to spreading holistic and alternative wellness practices in the community." ;
