    okh:function "This is a coppice and shrubland guild designed for a water receiving low spot at Foxhall garden. This area is inundated for several days following rainfall in Winter, and stays moist into early Summer.   == Introduction == This area is in zone 2 and is one of two paths to the chicken pen, so trailside could be considered zone 1 as it will get daily travel. Trails are in yellow, circles are the blueberry rings. There are four areas within this guild:  trailside - herbaceous plantings along the main path, a short way through the blueberry shrubland, including the trail itself." ;
