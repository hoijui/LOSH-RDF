function = "Because of the success of the Marshall Plan after World War II in rebuilding Europe, it was believed that the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and other aid agencies around the world, could bring the remainder of the world out of poverty by providing similar help. The many billions of dollars that these agencies have put into the less developed countries in the past 50 years has increased the GNP of each country and the wealth of the 20% of the population who control the country, but the number of people living in poverty (less than $2 per day) has increased and the gap between the rich and the poor has increased. The question is: What is missing in the programs sponsored by these aid agencies? One search for an answer to this question began with the evolution and development of the Village Earth Model--which began in 1960, during a special study that became the initial design of the U.S. Peace Corps. It was evident, even then, that these large-scale programs were not reaching the poverty-stricken villagers."
