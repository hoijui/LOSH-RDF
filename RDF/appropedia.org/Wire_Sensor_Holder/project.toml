function = "This is for my GrowBot project for senior design (Both project pages can be found above in related pages). The length is customizable and a wire can fit in the channel and be fastened with a small zip tie in the slot half way down the shaft. The holes can also be fastened together with a zip tie. The fit should be stiff so that you can adjust the angles and they will stay put. This project will help hold a wire that has an inductor on the end to sense a frequency induced wire that is burried under ground."
