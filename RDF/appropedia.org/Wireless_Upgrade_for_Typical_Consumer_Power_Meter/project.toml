function = "The Queen's Solar Design Team, in collaboration with the Queens Applied Sustainability Group hopes to modify a typical consumer power meter to provide live internet monitoring and recording of residential power consumption.   == Introduction == With today's rising prices in energy more attention has been towards energy conservation. Manufacturers are now trying to create green versions of their products that utilize less energy. Green options can sometimes be more expensive than their more energy hungry counterparts. Power monitors can help you reduce your energy consumption by identifying phantom loads, by helping you reduce your power consumption, and by helping quantify the savings you could make by upgrading to energy efficient devices."
