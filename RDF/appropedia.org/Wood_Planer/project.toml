Planes are tools which are used to shape wood by removing thin uniform strips of wood. There are many types of planes, as a start this is a block plane; the smallest of hand planes designed to be used with one hand. Small and versatile typically block planes are used to facilitate joinery by bringing boards into tolerance with each other, but over all the use of the block plane is only limited by the imagination of the wood worker.   == Bill of Materials == Total four parts made in FreeCAD.
