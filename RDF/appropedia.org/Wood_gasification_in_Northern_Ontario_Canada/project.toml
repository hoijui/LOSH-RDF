function = "Biomass gasification is the most efficient method to convert organic material into heat. Additionally, this gas may be used to fuel both internal and external combustion engines thereby creating the potential to do work, whether that is generation of electricity or to provide transportation. Gasification of biomass is a process whereby heat is applied to the fuel in an oxygen deprived atmosphere giving incomplete combustion. The gaseous products are tars, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. All but the last are capable of supporting further combustion which usually occurs in a separate location or chamber."
