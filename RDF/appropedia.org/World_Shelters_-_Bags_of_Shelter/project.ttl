    okh:function "This page discusses Bags of Shelter, an earthbag shelter designed for World Shelters to use as transitional shelter for people in Haiti affected by the January 2010 Earthquake. World Shelters is a non-profit organization dedicated to producing housing for disaster relief and general humanitarian needs. A four person design team, Humangineers, designed Bags of Shelter as part of Lonny Grafman's Introduction to Design class at Humboldt State University.   == Background == This project was done for our 12-week assignment for Introduction to Design for the Spring 2010 semester. Our client, World Shelters, asked Humangineers to use dirt as a resource in order to provide transitional housing for the people of Haiti." ;
