function = "This webpage is about the \"Papercrete Wall\" Project from Engr 215 Spring 2010. The objective of this project is to design and build a rigid, cost effective inner wall of the World Shelter's Just Add Sticks (JAS) system.   == Papercrete Wall Project Plan == The designed inner wall system incorporates the use of papercrete, a weatherproof and fire resistant material. Papercrete makes use of the fibers found in paper and durability in concrete to form a rigid structure. The Papercrete Wall involves a wire mesh endoskeleton which provides the rigidity but still allows the wall piece to flex which provides protection from winds and the elements of nature."
