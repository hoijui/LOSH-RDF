    okh:function "The goal of the Engineering 215 Spring Semester of 2010 Rubble to Resource project was to find a use for the rubble created by the January earthquake in Haiti. The Rubble Trench Foundation is designed to utilize this rubble and to employ as many Haitians as possible in the process of constructing rubble trenches.   == Background == On Tuesday, 12 January 2010 a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit Haiti. This earthquake caused massive damage in 3 major cities and the countryside surrounding the epicenter. The Haitian Government reported that an estimated 115,000 people had died, 200,000 had been injured and many more have been left homeless." ;
