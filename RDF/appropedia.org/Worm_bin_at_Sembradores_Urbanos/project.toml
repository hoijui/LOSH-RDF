function = "A box of homemade worm compost is a practical solution and ecologically appropriate to transform organic waste into natural fertilizer. This worm compost allows us to turn nutrients and organic matter into soil, to participate in natural cycles, and reduce the ecological footprint of waste we generate. The worm box requires a minimum investment and low maintenance. It can be installed indoors and outdoors, including spaces and Departments in the city. The worms eat residual and waste food and transforms them into a rich natural fertilizer called worm castings or vermicompost, used to improve soil structure and health."
