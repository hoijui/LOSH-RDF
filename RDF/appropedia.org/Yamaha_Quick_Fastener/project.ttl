    okh:function "The quick fastener is what secures the plastic body panels to the frame of the snowmobile. They work by inserting them into the prefabed holes in the plastic, push in and turn it 90 degrees clockwise and the spring pushes back and locks it into place. This device qualifies as an OSAT Project because it was a request made by someone who needed snowmobile parts. This device is a fraction of what it would normally cost if bought from a dealer/shop. If you own a Yamaha 4-stroke snowmobile, you know the need for these quick fasteners." ;
