    okh:function "== Problem being addressed == TB kills close to 1.7 million people globally every year and is highly contagious, with the disease being spread primarily through airborne transmission.  When infectious people cough, sneeze, talk or spit, they propel TB germs, known as bacilli, into the air. A person needs only to inhale a small number of these to be infected. Left untreated, each person with active TB can  infect on average between 10 and 15 people every year.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device is a combination of an easy-to-use digital chest x-ray, a computer aided diagnostic (CAD) tool for analyzing chest x-rays, and relatively cheap, made-to-order laboratories to help diagnose tuberculosis in areas where there are shortages of health care workers and radiologists." ;
