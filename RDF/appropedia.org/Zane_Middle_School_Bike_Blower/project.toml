function = "== Abstract ==  The purpose of this project is to create a bicycle powered fan where students in grades 6-8 at Zane Middle School can generate enough energy to levitate an object. The Fantastic Cycle team set out to make learning fun, and resulted with the device called Bernoulli's Bike Blower. Bernoulli's Bike Blower is an innovative way for the middle school students at Zane Middle School to learn a basic principle of physics. The Bike Blower is set up to generate enough energy to levitate objects in mid air demonstrating Bernoulli's principle.    == Background ==  Zane Middle School located in Eureka, California teamed up with Humboldt State University's Engr215 Introduction to Design class in Spring 2014."
