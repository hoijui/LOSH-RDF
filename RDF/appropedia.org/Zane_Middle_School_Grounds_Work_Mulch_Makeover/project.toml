function = "Trevor Hammons, a supervisor at Zane Middle School in Eureka, CA requested to renovate a rectangle in front of the school, which was made up of mulch and a few pitiful plants, by making it more presentable and useful for the students. Team Work, a group of aspiring environmental engineers from the spring semester Engineering 215 class, was up for the task. By planting ceanothus and azaleas with care, the rectangle was transformed into a much more aesthetically pleasing space for the students.   == Background ==  Humboldt State University offers a unique engineering design class, which pairs its students with actual clients to work through the design process. In the Spring semester of 2017, Thomas Premo, Bryce Scriven, Matthew Wardynski, and Tyler Wilkins were paired up with Trevor Hammons, the representative for Zane Middle School, in Eureka, CA. Zane Middle School is a 6th-8th-grade Magnet school with S.T.E.A.M. being their focus."
