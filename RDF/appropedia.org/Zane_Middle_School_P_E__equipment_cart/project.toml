function = "== Abstract ==    The purpose of this project was to work with Zane Middle School representative and P.E. Instructor, Garett Montana, to address the problems of storing and transporting P.E. equipment. The need for a P.E. equipment cart for the school was addressed and different designs were analyzed for possible solutions. The most important design of the cart must allow for storage of the P.E. jump-ropes that prevents them from tangling and kinking.   == Background == Zane Middle School, located in Eureka, CA is one of the largest middle schools from just north of San Francisco all the way up to Oregon. P.E. is a mandatory class for all students who attend the middle school; there are 6 P.E. classes a day (each 1 hour long) 5 days a week."
