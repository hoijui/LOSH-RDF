    okh:function "== Abstract ==  The purpose of this project is to design a safe bridge tester system that is able to measure the strength and endurance of bridges under pressure in pounds per square inch. Through the Engr215 Introduction to Design class at Humboldt state University, students from Team Burke der Meister: Chris Corona, Trevor Herron, Oliver Ruiz Hurtado, Drew White; designed a bridge tester machine that will be integrated into the engineering section of the STEAM Program at Zane Middle school for projects and competitions.   == Background == Zane Middle School introduced the STEAM program in the fall of 2013 that allowed students to include Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math into their already existing curriculum. The uniqueness of the STEAM program allows students to be exposed to design electives for real world situations. Zane Middle School came to the Humboldt State University Engineering Department in the spring of 2014 with the intent to improve their STEAM program." ;
