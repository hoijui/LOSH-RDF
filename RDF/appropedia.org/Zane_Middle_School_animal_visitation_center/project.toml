Two animal enclosures were created to contain goats and chickens. Both designs are made to create a unique learning environment for students to interact safely with goats and chickens inside the classrooms.   == Background == Zane Middle School is located in the heart of Eureka, California. Their focuses are in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics."
