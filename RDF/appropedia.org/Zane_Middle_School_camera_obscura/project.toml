function = "== Abstract ==  The purpose of this project was to create a working camera obscura that would teach students point perspective and allow students to trace the images displayed. Team Girl Scout Cookies designed a durable and portable model called the Accordion Camera Obscura, shown in Figure-1. This design was built around three major aspects: aesthetics, the bellows, and durability. Team Girl Scout Cookies was formed in Humboldt State University's Engineering 215 class.    == Background == The spring 2017 ENGR 215 class partnered with Zane Middle School, a  local school in Eureka, to design several projects that enhance the school or serve as a teaching aid."
