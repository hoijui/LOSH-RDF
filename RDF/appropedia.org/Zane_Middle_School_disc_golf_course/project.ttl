    okh:function "== Abstract ==  The objective of Team Falcon Punch is to create an upcycled disc golf course for the students at Zane Middle school physical education class as well for intermural tournaments. The disc golf course is to be made from weather-proof and recycled materials that can withstand the stress of being handled by students. In order to conduct this project, the process was broken down into five sections: Problem Formulation,Literature Review, Alternate Solution, Discussing Review, and Specification of Final Solution. As a result, a nine hole disc golf course was built from upcycled materials.   == Background == In the Fall semester course of Engineering 215 Intro to Design from Humboldt State University, we were contracted to build a 9 hole up cycle disc course for Zane Middle School, which is a public middle school located in Eureka, CA.  Zane Middle School is committed to inspiring academic Excellence, Creativity, and the confidence to Succeed." ;
