The edible landscaping will be an example of the engineering process necessary to create an edible landscape as well as a space for educating students about plants and their care.   == Background == Team Seedling is composed of four Humboldt State University students: Tanya Garcia, Jax Gill, Jared Goebel and Danielle Holter. They are currently enrolled in the spring semester of 2014 Engr215 Introduction to Design taught by Lonny Grafman.
