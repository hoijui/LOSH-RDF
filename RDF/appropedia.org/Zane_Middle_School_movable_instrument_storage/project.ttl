    okh:function "== Abstract ==  Through the Engineering 215 class at Humboldt State University, Team Strange was given the opportunity to design and assemble a movable instrument storage compartment for the music department at Zane Middle School. Current storage at Zane is not big enough creating unstable storage for the instruments. The team utilized and modified an industrial shelving unit from U-Line. Team Strange added a fourth shelf, adjusted the shelves according to instrument size, and finished both sides of the particleboard shelving with polyurethane. The team attached half-inch sheets of CDX plywood as side panels and decorated them with various upcycled materials to form a violin." ;
