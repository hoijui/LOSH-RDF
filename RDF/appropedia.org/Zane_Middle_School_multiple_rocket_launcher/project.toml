function = "== Abstract ==  The purpose of this project is to create a system to launch multiple paper rockets at once using air pressure. Zane Middle School teacher, Mr. Pinkerton was previously using a commercial Ultra Stomp Rocket bladder to fire off paper rockets one at a time. Triple B built and designed a system that fires at least six rockets at varying degrees of inclination. Triple B built undertook this project because of Engeneering 215 Intro to Design, a course at Humboldt State University instructed by Lonny Grafman."
