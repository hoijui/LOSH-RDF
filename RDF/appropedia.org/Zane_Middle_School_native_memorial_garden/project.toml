function = "The Gardiens' goal is to renew the memorial garden at the entrance of Zane Middle School. This consists of removing weeds, replacing the existing mulch with shredded redwood bark, planting new native plants, and installing a new path through the garden. Ideally this will lower the need for maintenance and increase the aesthetic appeal of the garden.   == Background == Zane Middle School is a school for 6-8th graders in Eureka, CA. Zane works to establish a diverse educational community within a nurturing environment to promote personal growth. Zane Middle School teamed up with Humboldt State University's engineering students and one goal was to update the memorial garden at the school's entrance to better represent the Zane mission."
