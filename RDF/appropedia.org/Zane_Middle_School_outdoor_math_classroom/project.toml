function = "== Abstract ==  The purpose of this project was to design an outdoor math classroom for our client's representative, Beth Baker, at Catherine Zane Middle School. Mrs. Baker believes in outdoor class activities because she realizes that the traditional teaching methods are not beneficial to all students. The Bluenotes created a teachers podium, a coordinate grid, and a number line to meet the clients needs of an outdoor math education environment.   == Background == Beth Baker, one of the math instructors at Zane Middle school, wished to engage students in an outdoor activity environment so she could assist students who struggle with practical applications of basic math concepts in a way that is engaging to students."
