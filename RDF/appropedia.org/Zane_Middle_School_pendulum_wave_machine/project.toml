function = "== Background ==  The Pendulum Wave Machine is a device meant to provide educational value regarding the function of basic wave patterns. The machine's creator is Team Outback from Humboldt State University's Spring 2017 Engr215 Introduction to Design Class. The client of the project is the Catherine L. Zane Middle School in Eureka, CA and the point person for the project is Ken Pinkerton. The pendulum wave machine makes its debut at the Humboldt Math Festival on the 29th of April, 2017. Zane wishes for the wave pendulum to be able to provide educational value to the Humboldt Community and serve as a tool in demonstrating basic wave patterns (sine, cosine, etc.) and behavior as it will ultimately serve as a visual aid for students at the school."
