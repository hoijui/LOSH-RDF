function = "== Abstract ==  The purpose of the project was to replace a failing permeable pathway (Fig 1) at Catherine Zane Middle School in Eureka, CA with a functioning permeable pathway. The previously installed pathway was uneven, impermeable and produced undesirable loose gravel. The new path was successfully implemented and the middle school now has a solid, level, and permeable concrete pathway in the Peace Garden.   == Background == The project was being design and installed by Team^2 (Fig 2) whose members were Ailynn Andersen, Jesse Bobrow, Catherine Carbajal and Julian Sicaud. Team^2 was a team in HSU's Engineering 215: Intro to Design course taken in Spring 2018 and taught by Lonny Grafman."
