function = "== Abstract ==  The green screen was constructed for the students at Zane Middle School. The frame's lightweight PVC construction allows for easy set-up/takedown and transportation. Screen tension is achieved through a system of adjustable clamps that create an even, shadowless surface on the screen, allowing good film results to be produced.   == Background == Zane Middle School instructor Damon Brooks requested the services of Team Visual Effects for the design and construction of a portable green screen apparatus for indoor/outdoor use by his digital media students. Team Visual Effects is made up of Abdullah Alyami, Liam Dooley, Kyle Ebert, and Karl Oman, all members of Lonny Grafmanâ€™s Spring 2017 ENGR 215 class."
