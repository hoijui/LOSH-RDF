function = "== Abstract ==  The portable stage was built for our client Zane Middle School to allow their students to become more involved in performance arts while making sure they learn in a fun, positive way. Zane Middle School does not have a theater and their previous portable stage was not big enough to accommodate for enough students. Our group, The Train Conductors, were given the opportunity to design and construct a  8'x16' and 8\" tall portable and store-able stage for Zane Middle School. Our team designed the stage to be of a simple construction  for the community members to recreate and/or maintain the stage as needed. A description of the stage, list of materials, and instructions to build can be found below."
