function = "== Abstract ==  How can you bring a classroom nearly anywhere? Parties at Catherine L. Zane Middle School and Humboldt State University were pondering that very question. Team Yerba Mates and one other team were tasked with answering that question. After some deliberation Yerba Mates decided to focus on the instructor's portion of the classroom. The team went through several brainstorming sessions and determined that the most basic functional aspects of a classroom required by an instructor would be a level surface on which to store lecture materials and a writing surface to convey information to students."
