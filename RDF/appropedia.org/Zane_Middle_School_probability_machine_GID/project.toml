function = "== Abstract ==  \tThis page and project was created by team GID, who's members include Chris Arcani, Neil Cudney, Marjani Ellison, and Eli Wallach. GID is from HSU's spring engineering 215 class. Our selected client for the design project during the course was Zane Middle School. Our project needed to visually demonstrate probability while being safe, interactive, and aesthetically appealing. The machine that best matched our criteria is a quincunx, which fits well with STEAM. STEAM is a learning motto set for Zane Middle School which stands for: Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics."
