    okh:function "== Abstract ==  The purpose of this project is to solve the awning drainage problem at Zane Middle School. Team Livewire created a replicable, integrated gutter box called the Streamline which is installed between the gutter downspout and serves as a direct drain and a surge tank. The Streamline, if deemed successful, will be implemented on other awning rainwater drainage systems throughout the campus.   == Background == Team Livewire consists of Abraham Audermauer, Ahron Cervania, Jake Cooper, and Zachary Ramsey. The storm water drainage system located around the cafeteria courtyard awning at Zane Middle School in Eureka, CA has proven ineffective." ;
