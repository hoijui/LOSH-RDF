function = "A Shake Table was designed and constructed to imitate earthquake magnitudes to help students at Zane Middle School to better understand seismic activity and allow them to test their own building structures.   == Background == Zane Middle School is a STEAM ( Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math ) school that believes hands on learning is very important for student success. For several years Engineering 215 students at Humboldt State University have teamed up with Zane's faculty to help them achieve this goal. In Spring 2017, our team was challenged with the construction of a Shake Table that demonstrates shaking of an earthquake. Our Shake Table design specifically allows 7th grade students to learn about the seismic activity in Earth's crust during an earthquake while also providing a way for them to be creative and test their own building designs."
