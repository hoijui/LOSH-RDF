function = "== Abstract ==  The purpose of this project was to troubleshoot the previously made solar robot charging station and find out why it no longer worked. The client requested that the station be made waterproof after getting the it back in working order. The station will be re-implemented at Zane Middle School in a classroom and will recharge the classes robots. The station is designed to inspire the children at Zane Middle School and spark their interest in renewable energy. The final product is a working solar robot charging station that is resistant to water."
