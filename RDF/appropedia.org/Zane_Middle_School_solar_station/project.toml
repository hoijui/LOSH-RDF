function = "== Abstract ==  The AC Team consists of: Jesse Cody, Jack Gates, Alec Howard, and Jeremy Potter. We worked with Zane Middle School to create a portable charging station that can charge robots, and it can also be used to light up an area at school events. The name given to this awesome contraption is the solar station. We started the design process with a brainstorming session, then moved onto more specific areas of the project. Watch our video!"
