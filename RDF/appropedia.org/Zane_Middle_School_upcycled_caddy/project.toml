function = "== Abstract == Zane Middle School is a middle school located in Eureka, California that educates 6th to 8th grade. Team Falcon-Jacks partnered with Zane Middle School to work with Elizabeth Baker, a mathematics teacher. Baker teaches 6th and 7th graders with a variety of creative tools and supplies that require organization and student accountability. Team Falcon-Jacks assignment was to create three caddies built from upcycled material for Elizabeth Baker to store school supplies and other school materials that the students utilize. Further work was focusing on the student accountability in which the caddies provide, and safety."
