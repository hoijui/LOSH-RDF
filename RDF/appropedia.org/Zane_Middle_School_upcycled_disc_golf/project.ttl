    okh:function "The purpose of this project was to create a portable, collapsible, disc golf station primarily from materials diverted from the waste stream. The project also must be reproducible so it can be integrated into the curriculum at Zane Middle School to further educate students on sustainability and the use of upcycled materials. To do this, the project was divided into five parts: Problem Formulation, Problem Analysis and Literature Review, Alternative Solutions, The Decision Process, and The Specifications of the Final Solution.   == Background == For our Humboldt State University Spring 2014 Engr215 Introduction to Design project we must build a disc golf basket for Zane Middle School. Zane Middle School is a S.T.E.A.M. School, which stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics." ;
