function = "== Problem being addressed == An infant incubator is used for neonates, infected babies, babies with low birth weight, babies with breathing issues, or transportation of infants. These devices are often very complex and expensive, prohibiting them from being effectively used in limited-resource settings. In addition, the number of at-home births that occur in low-resources settings further limits the accessibility of devices that could potentially aid the newborn.   == Detailed description of the solution == The infant medical incubator that has been developed by Zeal Medical is mobile and includes a temperature controller and numerous components for storage. The device monitors body temperature by means of a sensor, and the heat of the device itself can be adjusted accordingly by the presiding technician."
