function = "Stop building Victorian houses, use two by twelve inch walls in the 21 st century.   == Introduction == Anyone building new construction, please consider making all exterior walls a minimum of two by twelve (2\" x 12\"). With a 2 x 12 wall you can achieve at least R40, this will reduce most heating and cooling energy needs for the house. You can even add inches to your walls for a retrofit to achieve this if you ever need to replace siding. Let's declare the end of the 2 x 4 for external walls."
