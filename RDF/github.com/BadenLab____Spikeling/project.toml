function = "A hardware implementation of the Izhikevich model of a spiking neuron.\nUnderstanding of how neurons encode and compute information is fundamental to our study of the brain,\nbut opportunities for hands-on experience with neurophysiological techniques on live neurons are scarce in science education.\nHere, we present Spikeling, an open source Â£25 in silico implementation of a spiking neuron that mimics a wide range of neuronal behaviours\nfor classroom education and public neuroscience outreach.\n\nSpikeling is a device for teaching how neurons work\n"
