function = "The CubeFactory 2 is an autonomous and portable mini factory with own energy and material supply. It embeds three modules: a 3D-printer, a plastic recycler producing filament for the 3D-printer for closed-loop material supply as well as photovoltaic panels and batteries for energy supply. It was developed at the Department for Assembly Technology and Factory Management of the Technische Universität Berlin in the frame of the Collaborative Research Center 1026 \"Sustainable Manufacturing - Shaping Global Value Creation\".\nIn its current state of development, the purpose of the CubeFactory2 is primarily illustrative and to support awareness on sustainable manufacturing. If offers an experienceable application of the concepts of circularity and resource conservation. The long term vision is to take advantage of its compactness, portability and autonomy, in order to enable fabrication in areas of low infrastructure. [Muschard, B and Bonvoisin, J. 2019.
