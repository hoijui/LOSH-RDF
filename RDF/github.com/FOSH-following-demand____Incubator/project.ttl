    okh:function """We built an open source Incubator for biology lab in Cameroon; since most of them are under-equipped due to the high cost of lab equipment. We believe that DIY and Open Science Hardware, can facilitate access to low-cost and high-quality equipment for biology labs in Cameroon and Africa. We are a team of 4 people, based in Yaound√©, Cameroon.
This equipment is an incubator, designed to keep the contents at a constant temperature above the ambient temperature. It is an insulated box (a cooler box) that contains a heater (lightbulb), a temperature sensor and some electronics and software that will control the temperature to keep it constant at the level input by the user.

The primary use case is microbiology. It is essential for many protocols to have optimal growth temperature for important microrganisms such as Escherichia coli bacteria. However, mst biology labs in Cameroon and elsewhere in resource-constrained contexts are under-equipped due to the high cost of lab equipment. Other use cases include a drying chamber and a yoghurt maker.""" ;
