function: Carla Cargo allows you to transport heavy loads quickly, environmentally friendly and without sitting in traffic. It can be combined with any regular bicycle or e-bike. Thanks to an integrated mechanical overrun brake, it is possible to carry heavy loads extremely safely. Additionally, an electric support can make your Carla even more agile and faster.
