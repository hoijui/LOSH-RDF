function: Flipper Zero is a multi tool device for geeks with a curious personality
  of a cyber-dolphin who really loves to hack. It can interact with digital systems
  in real life and grow while you are hacking. The idea of Flipper Zero is to combine
  all the phreaking hardware tools you'd need for hacking on the go.
