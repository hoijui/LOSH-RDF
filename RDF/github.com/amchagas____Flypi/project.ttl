    okh:function """"Flypi" is a 3D printable all in one biology lab that can be used for state of the art experiments in neurosciences as well as for human intestine parasites detection.
It is a 3D-printable open-source platform for fluorescence microscopy, optogenetics, and accurate temperature control during behaviour of zebrafish, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans.

Flypi was developed for researchers to perform experiments using low cost tools as well as educators to train students and do outreach activities with the general public""" ;
