function = "This project is a 3D printable design that enables very fine (sub-micron) mechanical positioning of a small moving stage, with surprisingly good mechanical stability.  It follows on from the OpenFlexure Microscope.  Currently, it's designed to function as a more-or-less drop in replacement for fibre alignment stages available from various scientific suppliers, but the project aims to be useful to electrophysiologists, nanotechnology folk, and many more.  \n\nOptomechanical alignment in teaching and research"
