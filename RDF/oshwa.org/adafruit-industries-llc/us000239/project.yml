function: "The Adafruit Trinket M0 may be small, but do not be fooled by its size! It\u2019s a tiny microcontroller board, built around the Atmel ATSAMD21, a little chip with a lot of power. Adafruit designed a microcontroller board that was small enough to fit into any project, and low cost enough to use without hesitation. Perfect for when you don\u2019t want to give up your expensive dev-board and you aren\u2019t willing to take apart the project you worked so hard to design."
