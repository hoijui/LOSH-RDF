function = "What’s smaller than a Feather but larger than a Trinket? It’s an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express! Small, powerful, with a rockin’ ATSAMD21 Cortex M0 processor running at 48 MHz - this microcontroller board is perfect when you want something very compact, but still with a bunch of pins. ItsyBitsy M0 Express is only 1.4” long by 0.7” wide, but has 6 power pins, 23 digital GPIO pins (12 of which can be analog in, 1x analog out, and 13x PWM out)."
