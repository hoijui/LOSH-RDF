    okh:function "This feather is powered by the ATSAMD51J19 - with its 120MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support and 512KB Flash and 192KB RAM. Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset. And best of all, it’s a Feather - so you know it will work with all our FeatherWings! While you can use it with the Arduino IDE - and it’s bonkers fast when you do, we are shipping it with CircuitPython on board." ;
