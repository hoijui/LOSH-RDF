The Adafruit HalloWing is a skull-shaped ATSAMD21 board with a ton of extras built in to make for an adorable wearable, badge, development kit, or the engine for your next cosplay or prop. On the front is a cute 1.44” sized 128x128 full color TFT. There’s also 4 fang-teeth below the display, these are analog capacitive touch inputs with big alligator-clip holes." ;
