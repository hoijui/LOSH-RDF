function: "Are you the kind of person who doesn\u2019t take down the skeletons and spiders until after January? This is development board for you. The Adafruit HalloWing is a skull-shaped ATSAMD21 board with a ton of extras built in to make for an adorable wearable, badge, development kit, or the engine for your next cosplay or prop. On the front is a cute 1.44\u201D sized 128x128 full color TFT. There\u2019s also 4 fang-teeth below the display, these are analog capacitive touch inputs with big alligator-clip holes."
