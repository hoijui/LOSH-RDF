function = "The NeoTrellis M4 is an all-in-one USB + NeoPixel + Elastomer + Audio board. It’s powered by the SAMD51, a Cortex M4 core running at 120 MHz. This chip has a speedy core with CircuitPython support, hardware DSP&#x2F;floating point, dual DACs and all the goodies you expect from normal chips like I2C, ADC, DMA, etc. It has a roomy 512KB of flash and 192KB of SRAM so it’s great for CircuitPython, includes a full 8MB flash chip so tons of space for files and audio clips."
