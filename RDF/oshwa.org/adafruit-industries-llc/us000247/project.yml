function: "The Adafruit Grand Central features the Microchip ATSAMD51. This dev board is so big, it\u2019s not named after a Metro train, it\u2019s a whole freakin\u2019 station! This board is like a freight train, with its 120MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support. Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset."
