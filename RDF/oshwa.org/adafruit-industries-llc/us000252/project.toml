function = "Machine learning has come to the ‘edge’ - small microcontrollers that can run a very miniature version of TensorFlow Lite to do ML computations. The EdgeBadge is a compact board - it’s credit card sized. It’s powered by our favorite chip, the ATSAMD51, with 512KB of flash and 192KB of RAM. We add 2 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for TensorFlow Lite files, images, fonts, sounds, or other assets."
