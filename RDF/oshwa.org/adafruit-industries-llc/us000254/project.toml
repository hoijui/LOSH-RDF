The PyPortal is our easy-to-use IoT device that allows you to create all the things for the “Internet of Things” in minutes. Make custom touch screen interface GUIs, all open-source, and Python-powered using tinyJSON; APIs to get news, stock, weather, cat photos, and more – all over Wi-Fi with the latest technologies."
