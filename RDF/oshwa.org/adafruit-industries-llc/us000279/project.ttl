    okh:function "The most powerful Metro at this time, the Adafruit Metro M4 featuring the Microchip ATSAMD51. This Metro is like a bullet train, with it’s 120MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support. Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset. To start off the ATSAMD51 journey it has a classic ‘Arduino compatible’ shape and pinout. This Metro is the same size as the others, and is compatible with many shields." ;
