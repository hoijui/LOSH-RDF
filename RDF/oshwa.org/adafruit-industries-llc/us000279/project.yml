function: "The most powerful Metro at this time, the Adafruit Metro M4 featuring the Microchip ATSAMD51. This Metro is like a bullet train, with it\u2019s 120MHz Cortex M4 with floating point support. Your code will zig and zag and zoom, and with a bunch of extra peripherals for support, this will for sure be your favorite new chipset. To start off the ATSAMD51 journey it has a classic \u2018Arduino compatible\u2019 shape and pinout. This Metro is the same size as the others, and is compatible with many shields."
