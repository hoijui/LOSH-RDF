function: With Adafruit STEMMA boards you can easily and safely plug sensors and devices together, like this Adafruit STEMMA Speaker - Plug and Play Audio Amplifier. Like the name implies, it's got a class D audio amplifier on board, and our favorite little 1 Watt 8 ohm speaker. This speaker uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
