function: Inside the MPU-6050, there are two sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, which can tell you which direction is down. The other is a gyroscope that can sense how fast the board is being twisted around. By combining this data you can tell how your project is moving through space This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
