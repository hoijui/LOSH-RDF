function = "The MSA301 is a super small and low cost triple-axis accelerometer. It's inexpensive, but has just about every 'extra' you'd want in an accelerometer. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
