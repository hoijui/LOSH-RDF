function = "This miniature GPS breakout is only 1\" x 1\" (~ 25mm x 25mm) but houses a complete GPS/GNSS solution with both I2C and UART interfaces. There's even an antenna on top so it's plug and play. This breakout uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.  Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
