function = "This compact sensor uses I2C to communicate and its very easy to use. This sensor can sense ranges from +-4 gauss (+- 400 uTesla) up to +-16 gauss (+- 1600 uT or 1.6 mT). For ultra high precision, 155 Hz update rate is recommended - but the sensor can also output at 1000 Hz. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
