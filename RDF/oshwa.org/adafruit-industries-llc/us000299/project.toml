function = "The new STM32F405 Feather that we designed runs CircuitPython at a blistering 168MHz. We even put a STEMMA QT / Qwiic port on the end, so you can really easily plug and play I2C sensors. This board has a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
