function: Extend and expand your Circuit Playground projects with a bolt on E-Ink Gizmo that lets you add a lovely tri-color e-Ink display in a sturdy and reliable fashion. This PCB looks just like a round E-Ink breakout but has permanently affixed M3 standoffs. This display has Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible STEMMA QT connectors which allows for the addition of I2C sensors and accessories without needing to solder.
