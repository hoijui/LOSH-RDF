function = "The Mini PiTFT comes with a full color 240x240 pixel IPS display with great visibility at all angles. The TFT uses only the SPI port so its very fast, and we leave plenty of pins remaining available for buttons, LEDs, sensors, etc. This display has Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible STEMMA QT connectors which allows for the addition of I2C sensors and accessories without needing to solder.
