function = "Plug the Crickit HAT onto your Pi using the standard 2x20 GPIO connector and start controlling motors, servos, solenoids. You also get 8 signal pins with analog inputs or PWM outputs, capacitive touch sensors, a level-shifted NeoPixel driver and 3W amplified speaker output from the I2S port. It complements & extends your Pi, so you can still use all the goodies on the Pi, but now you have a robotics playground as well.  Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
