function = "Having WiFi managed by a separate chip means your code is simpler. Send socket-based commands over 8MHz SPI for high speed data transfer. You can use 3V or 5V Arduino, any chip from the ATmega328 or up. It also works great with CircuitPython, a SAMD51/Cortex M4 minimum required since we need a bunch of RAM. All you need is an SPI bus and 2 control pins plus a power supply that can provide up to 250mA. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
