function: This USB-to-BLE board makes it easy to get your computer talking to your BLE enabled phone or tablet using a standard serial/UART connection. In it's simplest form, it works on the same principle as a common USB/Serial adapter. Any data that you enter via your favorite terminal emulator on your development machine will be transferred over the air to the connected phone or tablet, and vice versa, as a basic 'UART' connection. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
