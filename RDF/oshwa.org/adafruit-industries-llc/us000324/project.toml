function = "This is the easiest way possible to add small, bright RGB pixels to your project. We took the same technology from our Flora NeoPixels and made them breadboard friendly, allowing for easy soldering, chaining and breadboarding. These ultra-bright LEDs have a constant-current driver cooked right into the LED package. Being chainable, they only require 1 pin/wire to control as many LEDs as you like. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
