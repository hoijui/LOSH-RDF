function: These backpacks feature an HT16K33 I2C LED driver, they're simple and easy to use - you can use our very nice library for the backpacks to get running in under half an hour, with numbers and letters displaying. Like our other LED backpacks, these are end-to-end stackable and by soldering the address jumpers on the back you can have up to 8 backpacks all sharing the same two I2C wires.
