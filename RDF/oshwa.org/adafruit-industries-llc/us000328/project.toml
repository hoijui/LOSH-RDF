function = "The MONSTER M4SK is like the Hallowing but with two gorgeous 240x240 pixel IPS TFT displays, driven by a powerful 120MHZ Cortex M4 processor. This board has 4 JST plugs. The 2 3-pin JSTs connect to analog/timer pins on the SAMD51, so you can use them for sensors or GPIO devices. The 4-pin JST connector connects to the I2C port and you can fit Grove connectors in it. For the PDM mic port, you can use a breakout cable to wire to a PDM mic. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
