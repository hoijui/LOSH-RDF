function = "Plug your :bit into the 40 pin edge connector on the CRICKIT and start controlling motors, servos, solenoids. You also get signal pins, capacitive touch sensors, a NeoPixel driver and amplified speaker output. It complements & extends micro:bit so you can still use all the goodies on the :bit, but now you have a robotics playground as well. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
