function = "Add some circuitry to your Beagle Bone or Beagle Bone Black with our lovely Proto Cape. This PCB fits neatly on top of a Beagle Bone, without getting in the way of the Ethernet jack, and provides a breakout to both 46 pin headers - with individual numbering to keep them straight. We also threw down some strips to access the 5V and 3V power supplies as well as two SMT breakouts, one for SOIC-8's and one for SOT-23's. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
