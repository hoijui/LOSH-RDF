    okh:function "The library for this breakout runs on our Feather M0's (the Basic Proto, Adalogger, Bluefruit, Express, and others) and handles all the NeoPixeling for you, up to 8 strands of concurrent DMA output each one can be 250 pixels long for a total of 8 x 250 = 2000 pixels. That leaves you some RAM for your code to run in as well - the theoretical max is 340 pixels per strand but you'd be using all the RAM on the M0 chip.
