    okh:function "The library for this brekaout runs on our Feather M4 and handles all the NeoPixeling for you, up to 8 strands of concurrent DMA output each one can be 1750 RGB pixels long for a total of 8 x 1750 = 14000 pixels. Even though you could connect that many pixels, what we think this 'Wing does best is take advantage of DMA + the SAMD51's blazingly-fast 120MHz processor to manage animations for hundreds of pixels with ease Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
