function = "24 ultra bright smart LED NeoPixels are arranged in a circle with 2.6\" (66mm) outer diameter. Snap in your Spark and upload the NeoPixel library code to light up the LEDs. Each LED is addressable as the driver chip is inside the LED. Each one has ~18mA constant current drive so the color will be consistent even if the voltage varies, and no external choke resistors are required. Power the whole thing with a ~3.5-5.5 VDC battery pack. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
