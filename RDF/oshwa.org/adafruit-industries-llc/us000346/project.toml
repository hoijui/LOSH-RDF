function = "The Adafruit PCT2075 Temperature Sensor is a 'code compatible' drop in replacement for a very common I2C temperature sensor, the LM75. Compared to the LM75, however, the 11-bit ADC in the PCT2075 provides more precise measurements when compared to the LM75's 9-bit ADC. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
