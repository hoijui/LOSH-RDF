function = "The Adafruit LPS25 absolute pressure sensor can quickly and easily measure this air pressure, useful when you want to know about the weather (are we in a low pressure or high pressure system?) or to determine altitude, as the air thins out the higher we get above sea level. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
