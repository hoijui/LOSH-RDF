function = "The ST LPS35HW is a barometric pressure and temperature sensor that is also safe to use in wet environments. The sensing element is in a ceramic package and is encased in a waterproof gel. The LPS35HW has a 24bit pressure data and 16 bit temperature data, allowing it to deliver pressure readings with +/- 0.1% hPa accuracy. It can measure from 260 to 1260 hPa and is able to withstand pressure up to 20 times its measurement range. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
