function = "You can easily attach a tube to this sensor, to measure air pressure inside a close space. Unlike most ported pressure sensors, this one uses I2C, making it really easy to use with any microcontroller. Inside is a silicone-gel covered pressure sensing gauge with a pre-calibrated and compensated 24 bit ADC. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
