function: "This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring humidity with \xB13% accuracy, barometric pressure with \xB11 hPa absolute accuraccy, and temperature with \xB11.0\xB0C accuracy. Because pressure changes with altitude, and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with  \xB11 meter or better accuracy! Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
