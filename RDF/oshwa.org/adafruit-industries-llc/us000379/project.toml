function = "The 2.2\" display has 320x240 color pixels. Unlike the low cost LCD displays, which are CSTN type and thus have poor color and slow refresh, this display is a true TFT! The TFT driver (ILI9340 or compatible) can display full 18-bit color (262,144 shades!). And the LCD will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
