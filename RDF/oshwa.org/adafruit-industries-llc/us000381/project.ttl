    okh:function "We've been looking for a display like this for a long time - it's only 1.5\" diagonal but has a high density 220 ppi, 240x240 pixel display with full-angle viewing. This lovely little display breakout is the best way to add a small, colorful and very bright display to any project. Since the display uses 4-wire SPI to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
