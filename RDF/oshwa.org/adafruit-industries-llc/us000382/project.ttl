    okh:function "The 2.0\" display has 320x240 color pixels. This display is a true TFT! Not only that, but its an IPS display for vivid color and high-angle visibility. The TFT driver (ST7789) can display full 18-bit color (262,144 shades), but almost all drivers will use just 16-bit color. The TFT will always come with the same driver chip so there's no worries that your code will not work from one to the other. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
