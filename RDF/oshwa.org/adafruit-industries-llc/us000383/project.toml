function = "This lovely little display breakout is the best way to add a small, colorful and very bright display to any project. Since the display uses 4-wire SPI to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller. The 1.3\" display has 240x240 16-bit full color pixels and is an IPS display, so the color looks great up to 80 degrees off axis in any direction.
