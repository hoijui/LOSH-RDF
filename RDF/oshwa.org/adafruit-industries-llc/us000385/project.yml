function: "The ICM20649 is a 6-DoF accelerometer and Gyro, capable of measuring up to \xB130g and \xB14000 dps. Along with the sensor, the breakout board includes a voltage regulator and level shifting circuitry to allow you to use it with a range of devices nearly as large as its measurement ranges. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
