    okh:function "The Analog Devices ADT7410 gets straight to the point - it's an I2C temperature sensor, with 16-bit 0.0078°C temperature resolution and 0.5°C temperature tolerance. The ADT7410 has 2 address pins, so you can have up to 4 sensors on one I2C bus. Wire it up to your microcontroller or single-board computer to get reliable temperature readings with ease Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
