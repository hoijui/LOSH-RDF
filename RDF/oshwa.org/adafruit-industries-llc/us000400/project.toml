function = "Using only two pins, control 16 free-running PWM outputs! You can even chain up 62 breakouts to control up to 992 PWM outputs. It's an i2c-controlled PWM driver with a built in clock. That means that you do not need to continuously send it signal tying up your microcontroller, its completely free running! Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
