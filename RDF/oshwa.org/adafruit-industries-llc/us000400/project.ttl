    okh:function "Using only two pins, control 16 free-running PWM outputs! You can even chain up 62 breakouts to control up to 992 PWM outputs. It's an i2c-controlled PWM driver with a built in clock. That means that you do not need to continuously send it signal tying up your microcontroller, its completely free running!
