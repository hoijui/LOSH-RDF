function: "This precision sensor from Bosch can measure humidity with \xB13% accuracy, barometric pressure with \xB11 hPa absolute accuracy, and temperature with \xB11.0\xB0C accuracy. Because pressure changes with altitude, and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with  \xB11 meter or better accuracy! Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
