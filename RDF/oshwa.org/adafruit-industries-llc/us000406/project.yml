function: This sensor can sense ranges from +-50 gauss (+- 5000 uTesla!) with no range-setting required. For high resolution, you can read at 100 Hz update rate. If you don't mind a little loss of precision, the sensor can output at 150 Hz. To make life easier so you can focus on your important work, we've taken the LIS2MDL and put it onto a breakout PCB along with support circuitry to let you use this little wonder with 3.3V or 5V logic levels.
