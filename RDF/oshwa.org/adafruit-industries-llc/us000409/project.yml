function: The ADXL343 is a triple-axis accelerometer with digital I2C and SPI interface breakout. It has a wide sensitivity range and high resolution, operating with an 10 or 13-bit internal ADC. Built-in motion detection features make tap, double-tap, activity, inactivity, and free-fall detection trivial. There's two interrupt pins, and you can map any of the interrupts independently to either of them. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
