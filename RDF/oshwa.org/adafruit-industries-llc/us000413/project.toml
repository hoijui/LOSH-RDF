function = "The Adafruit MCP9600 does all that for you, and can be easily interfaced with any microcontroller or single-board-computer with I2C. Inside, the chip handles all the analog stuff for you, and can interface with just about any thermocouple type: K, J, T, N, S, E, B and R type are supported! You can also set various alerts for over/under temperature, and read the thermocouple temperature and the chip temperature. All this over I2C.
