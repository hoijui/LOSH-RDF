function: The VL6180X contains a very tiny laser source, and a matching sensor. The sensor can detect the "time of flight", or how long the laser light has taken to bounce back to the sensor. This sensor can handle about 5mm to 100mm of range distance. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
