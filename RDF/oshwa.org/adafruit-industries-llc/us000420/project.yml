function: "The HTS221 can measure relative humidity from 0%-100% rH with a sensitivity of 0.004% and 3.5% accuracy between 20-80%. It can also measure temperature from -40 to 120 degrees C, with a resolution of 0.016\xB0C with \xB10.5 \xB0C accuracy between 15 and +40 \xB0C. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without solder. Additionally, this sensor supports spi.
