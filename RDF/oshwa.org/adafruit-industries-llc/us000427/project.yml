function: The VEML7700 makes your life easier by calculating the lux, which is an SI unit for light. You'll get more consistent readings between multiple sensors because you aren't dealing with some unit-less values. The sensor has 16-bit dynamic range for ambient light detection from 0 lux to about 120 klux with resolution down to 0.0036 lx/ct, with software-adjustable gain and integration times.
