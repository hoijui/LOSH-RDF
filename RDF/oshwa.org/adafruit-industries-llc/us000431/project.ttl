The Adafruit 1.3\" Color TFT Bonnet for Raspberry Pi is the big sister to our mini PiTFT add-ons. This bonnet has 240x240 color pixels in an IPS TFT display controlled over SPI. This display is super small, only about 1.3\" diagonal, but since it is an IPS display, it's very readable with high contrast and visibility.
