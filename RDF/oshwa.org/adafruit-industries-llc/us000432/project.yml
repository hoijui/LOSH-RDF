function: This TFT display is big (3.5" diagonal) bright (6 white-LED backlight) and colorful! 480x320 pixels with individual RGB pixel control. As a bonus, this display has a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen. This display has a controller built into it with RAM buffering, so that almost no work is done by the microcontroller. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
