function: If you'd like a compact display, with buttons and a joystick - we've got what you're looking for. The Adafruit 128x64 OLED Bonnet for Raspberry Pi has 128x64 pixels and a 1.3" diagonal screen. With the OLED display in the center, we had some space on either side so we added a 5-way joystick and two pushbuttons. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
