function = "The breakout has a 1.54\" monochrome (black and white) display. It's higher resolution than our 1.54\" Tri-Color display with 200x200 black pixels on a white-ish background. The monochrome displays also take a lot less time to update, only a couple seconds instead of 15 seconds. Using our CircuitPython or Arduino libraries, you can create a 'frame buffer' with what pixels you want to have activated and then write that to the display.
