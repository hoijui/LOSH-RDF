function: The ADXL377 3-axis accelerometer can sense up to 200g's of force. The sensor is soldered onto a PCB with four mounting holes and a 3.3V regulator so you can use it with 5v logic such as an Arduino. We also add 0.01uF filter caps for 500Hz output bandwidth. This breakout comes with 3 analog outputs for X, Y and Z axis measurements. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
