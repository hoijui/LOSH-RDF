function = "This breakout makes it easy to use this nice sensor from SGX Sensortech. The MiCS-5524 is a robust MEMS sensor for indoor carbon monoxide and natural gas leakage detection, it's suitable also for indoor air quality monitoring; breath checker and early fire detection. This sensor is sensitive to CO ( ~ 1-1000 ppm), Ammonia (~ 1 - 500 ppm), Ethanol (~ 10 - 500 ppm), H2 (~ 1 - 1000 ppm), and Methane / Propane / Iso-Butane (~ 1,000++ ppm) Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
