    okh:function "PDM is the 'third' kind of microphone you can integrate with electronics, apart from analog or I2S. These microphones are very commonly used in products, but are rarely seen in maker projects. Still, they have some benefits so we thought we'd offer a breakout for the shop. This version of the mic has a 4-JST SH connector with 3V, GND, DAT, CLK connections that can be used with a 4-JST-SH cable to make a flexible mic arrangement.
