function = "Just like 'classic' electret microphones, MEMS mics can detect sound and convert it to voltage, but they don't need a bias resistor or amplifier, its all in one! The SPW2430 is a small, low cost MEMS mic with a range of 100Hz - 10KHz, good for just about all general audio recording/detection. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
