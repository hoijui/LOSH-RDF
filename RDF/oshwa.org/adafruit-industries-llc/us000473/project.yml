function: ItsyBitsy is only 1.4" long by 0.7" wide, but has 6 power pins, 6 analog & digital pins and 17 digital pins. It packs much of the same capability as an Arduino UNO. The ItsyBitsy 32u4 5V 16MHz uses the Atmega32u4 chip. Not only is ItsyBitsy programmable using the Arduino IDE as you already set up, but a vast number of Arduino projects will work out of the box.
