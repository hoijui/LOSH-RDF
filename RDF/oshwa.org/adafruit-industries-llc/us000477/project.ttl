    okh:function "We wanted to design a microcontroller board that was small enough to fit into any project, and low cost enough to use without hesitation. The Attiny85 is a fun processor because despite being so small, it has 8K of flash, and 5 I/O pins, including analog inputs and PWM 'analog' outputs. We designed a USB bootloader so you can plug it into any computer and reprogram it over a USB port just like an Arduino. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
