    okh:function "At the Feather 328P's heart is an ATmega328P clocked at 8 MHz and at 3.3V logic. This chip has 32K of flash and 2K of RAM, and we paired it with a SiLabs CP2104 to give it USB-to-Serial program & debug capability built in. Works great when you want to keep your classic Arduino code compatibility, but want to use one of our dozens of FeatherWings Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
