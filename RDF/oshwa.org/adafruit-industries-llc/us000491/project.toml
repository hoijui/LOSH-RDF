function = "The Terminal Block Breakout FeatherWing kit is like the Golden Eagle of prototyping FeatherWings. To start, you get a nice prototyping area underneath your Feather, with extra pads for ground, 3.3V and SDA/SCL. Not one to stop there, we expanded the PCB out to 2\" x 2.5\" with 3.5mm pitch terminal blocks down each side. There's also four mounting holes so you can attach the breakout to your enclosure or project. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
