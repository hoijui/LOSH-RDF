function: This lovely little shield is the best way to add a small, colorful and bright display to any project. This Arduino shield comes complete with microSD card slot and a 5-way joystick navigation switch and three selection buttons. Since the display uses only 4 pins to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used easily to add a display & interface without exhausting the memory or pins.
