function: 'Arranged in a 5x8 matrix, each pixel is individually addressable. Only one pin (Digital #6) is required to control all the LEDs. You can cut a trace and use nearly any other pin if you need some customization. To make it easy to start, the LEDs are by default powered from the 5V onboard Arduino supply. As long as you aren''t lighting up all the pixels full power white that should be fine. Click the link labeled ''Project Website'' to find out more.'
