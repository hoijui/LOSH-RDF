function = "This motor shield now has the TB6612 MOSFET drivers with 1.2A per channel current capability (you can draw up to 3A peak for approx 20ms at a time). It also has much lower voltage drops across the motor so you get more torque out of your batteries. It has a fully-dedicated PWM driver chip onboard. This chip handles all the motor and speed controls over I2C. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
