function = "This touch-able add on shield for Arduinos gives you 12 capacitive touch sensors. Capacitive touch sensing works by detecting when a person (or animal) has touched one of the sensor electrodes. Capacitive touch sensing used for stuff like touch-reactive tablets and phones, as well as control panels for appliances. This shield allows you to create electronics that can react to human touch, with up to 12 individual sensors. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
