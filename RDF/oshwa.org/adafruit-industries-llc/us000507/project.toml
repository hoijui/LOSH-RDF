function = "If you've got an Arduino-compatible board, with an ATmega328p chip (like our Metro 328) or SAMD21 (like the Metro M0) or even SAMD51 (like our Metro M4) this shield will make usage a snap! A little light soldering to attach the headers, connector and terminal block and you're ready to rock. For 800mA or less power usage on the matrix you can even 'borrow' the 5V power from the Arduino's regulator. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
