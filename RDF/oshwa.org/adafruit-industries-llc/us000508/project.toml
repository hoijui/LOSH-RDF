function = "This prototyping shield now is even better with Version R3 - updated for the most compatibility with just about all the Arduinos. It works with UNO, Mega, Leonardo, NG, Diecimila, Duemilanove, and compatible Arduinos. Yun's and Arduino Ethernets have a chunky Ethernet jack that gets in the way of stacking, you can use the stacking headers included and it will work, just doesn't sit nice and flat. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
