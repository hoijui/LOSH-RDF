function: Here is a shield for Arduino 328's that allows you to add quality audio to an electronic project. It can play up to 22KHz 12bit uncompressed audio files of any length. It's low cost, available as an easy-to-make kit. It has an onboard DAC, filter and op-amp for high quality output. Audio files are read off of an SD/MMC card, which are available at nearly any store. Volume can be controlled with the onboard thumbwheel potentiometer. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
