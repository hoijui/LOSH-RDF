function: This board lets you use the powerful ESP32 as a WiFi co-processor. You probably have your favorite ItsyBitsy that comes with its own set of awesome peripherals and lots of libraries. But it doesn't have WiFi built in! So lets give that chip a best friend, the ESP32. This chip can handle all the heavy lifting of connecting to a WiFi network and transferring data from a site, even if its using the latest TLS/SSL encryption.
