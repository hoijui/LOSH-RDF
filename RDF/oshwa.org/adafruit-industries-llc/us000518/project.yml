function: USB C features a symmetric/reversible connector, more data pins and higher current output capability. But, for most developers, the pin usage you know and love from older USB will work just fine. This breakout gives you all the basics you need and a resistor configuration that mimics classic USB 2.0 for a downstream connection. The two 5.1K resistors on the CC1 pins indicate to the upstream port to provide 5V and up to 1.5A. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
