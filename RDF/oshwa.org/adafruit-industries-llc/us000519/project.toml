function = "This chip from FTDI is similar to their USB to serial converter chips but adds a 'multi-protocol synchronous serial engine' which allows it to speak many common protocols like SPI, I2C, serial UART, JTAG, and more. There's even a handful of digital GPIO pins that you can read and write to.  The FT232H breakout is like adding a little swiss army knife for serial protocols to your computer. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
