    okh:function "This fully-featured UDA1334A I2S Stereo DAC breakout is a perfect match for any I2S-output audio interface. It's affordable but sounds great. The NXP UDA1334A is a jack-of-all-I2S-trades: you can use 3.3V - 5V logic levels (a rarity), and can process multiple different formats by setting two pins to high or low. The DAC will process data immediately, and give you a clear, analog, stereo line level output. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
