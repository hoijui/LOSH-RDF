function: The Adafruit TPL5110 Power Timer is a stand-alone breakout that will turn any electronics into low-power electronics! It will take care of turning your project on/off using a built in timer that can vary from once every 100ms up to once every two hours. The TPL5110 is best when you are able to 'break' the power input line to place the TPL5110 between the power supply and Vin. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
