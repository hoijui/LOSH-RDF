    okh:function "With the 16x8 LED Matrix Backpack we've doubled your project's matrix capacity by making it super easy to get two separate 8x8 matrices onto one handy board! Matrices like these are 'multiplexed' - so to control 64 LEDs you need 16 pins and to control 128 LEDs, you'd need 24 pins. That's a lot of pins. That's where this lovely 16x8 LED matrix backpack comes in.  It makes adding a bright little display trivial, requiring only 4 pins.  Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
