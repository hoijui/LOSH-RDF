    okh:function "Sew a little sparkle into your wearable project with an Adafruit LED Sequin. These are the kid-sister to our popular Flora NeoPixel, they only show a single color and they don't have digital control, but that makes them smaller easier to use for many projects. Simply connect 3 to 6VDC to the + pin and ground to the - pin, and the LED on the board will light up. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
