function = "These backpacks feature an HT16K33 I2C LED driver, they're simple and easy to use - you can use our very nice library for the backpacks to get running in under half an hour. Like our other LED backpacks, these are end-to-end stackable and by soldering the address jumpers on the back you can have up to 8 backpacks all sharing the same two I2C wires.
