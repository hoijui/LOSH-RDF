function = "Instead of wiring 2 or 3 boards together to make a charging system, this little PCB sits on top of the PCB and allows a LiPoly/LiIon battery to plug in. When the Pro Trinket or ItsyBitsy USB port is powered, the battery is recharged automatically. Unplug the USB port and the microcontroller will switch over to the rechargeable battery. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
