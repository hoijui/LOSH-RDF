function: For all of you out there who want to control 12 channels of PWM, we salute you! We also would like you to check out this breakout board for the TLC59711 PWM driver chip. This chip can control 12 separate channels of 16-bit PWM output. This is the highest-resolution PWM board we've seen! Designed (and ideal) for precision LED control, this board is not good for driving servos. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
