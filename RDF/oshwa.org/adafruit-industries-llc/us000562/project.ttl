    okh:function "This breakout comes with 3 analog outputs for X, Y and Z axis measurements on a 0.75\"x0.75\" breakout board. The VCC takes up to 5V in and regulates it to 3.3V with an output pin. The analog outputs are ratiometric: that means that 0g measurement output is always at half of the 3.3V output (1.65V), -16g is at 0v and 16g is at 3.3V with full scaling in between.
