function = "This simple sensor only does one thing and gives an analog voltage output instead of requiring an I2C setup procedure. This makes it better for simple projects. It also has a 'true' UV sensor. To use, power the sensor and op-amp by connecting V+ to 2.7-5.5VDC and GND to power ground. Then read the analog signal from the OUT pin. The output voltage is: Vo = 4.3 * Diode-Current-in-uA. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
