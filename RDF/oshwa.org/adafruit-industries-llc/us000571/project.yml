function: This new Adafruit shield makes it easy to use a 16x2 Character LCD. Unfortunately, most 16x2 LCDs require quite a few digital pins, usually 9 to control the LCD and backlight. With this in mind, we devised a shield that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD, up to 3 backlight pins AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins.
