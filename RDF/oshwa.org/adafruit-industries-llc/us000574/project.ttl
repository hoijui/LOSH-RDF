    okh:function "Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V. That's where this lovely chip, the TXB0108 bi-directional level converter comes in. This chip perform bidirectional level shifting from pretty much any voltage to any voltage and will auto-detect the direction. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
