    okh:function "Because the Arduino (and Basic Stamp) are 5V devices, and most modern sensors, displays, flash cards and modes are 3.3V-only, many makers find that they need to perform level shifting/conversion to protect the 3.3V device from 5V. This level shifter board is very easy to use and has an I2C-compatible FET design following NXP's app note. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
