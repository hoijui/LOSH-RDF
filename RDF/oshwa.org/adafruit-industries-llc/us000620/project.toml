function = "If you've got a resistive touch screen that you'd like to use, you'll need this breakout! It has a medium pitch (1.0mm) connector soldered onto it, and it's broken out into the four resistive wires of the panel. If you need a breakout for 0.5mm-pitch touch panels, check out this product. If you want a breakout with a resistive-panel control driver chip on it, our STMPE I2C/SPI breakout or USB AR1100 driver will do what you need!
