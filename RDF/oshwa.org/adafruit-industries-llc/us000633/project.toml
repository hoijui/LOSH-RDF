function = "This breakout as a 2.13\" monochrome (black and white) display. It's higher resolution than our 2.13\" Tri-Color display with 250x122 black pixels on a white-ish background. The monochrome displays also take a lot less time to update, only a couple seconds instead of 15 seconds. Using our CircuitPython or Arduino libraries, you can create a 'frame buffer' with what pixels you want to have activated and then write that out to the display. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
