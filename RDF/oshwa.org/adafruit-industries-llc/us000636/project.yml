function: This FeatherWing has a 2-axis joystick and 5 momentary buttons so you can turn your feather board into a tiny game controller. This wing communicates with your host microcontroller over I2C so it's easy to use and doesn't take up any of your precious analog or digital pins. There is also an optional interrupt pin that can alert your feather when a button has been pressed or released to free up processor time for other tasks. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
