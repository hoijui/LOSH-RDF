function: This is the FeatherWing Doubler - a prototyping add-on and more for all Feather boards. This is similar to our FeatherWing Proto except there are two. The magic of the Doubler comes when stacking a Feather and another board on top of the Doubler so you can work with both boards simultaneously side-by-side. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
