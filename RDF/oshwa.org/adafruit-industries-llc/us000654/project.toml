function = "The Adafruit 2.7\" 400x240 SHARP Memory Display Breakout is a chonky cross between an eInk (e-paper) display and an LCD. It has the ultra-low power usage of eInk and the fast-refresh rates of an LCD. This model has a gray background, and the pixels show up as black-on-gray for a nice e-reader type display. The display is 'write only' which means that it only needs 3 pins to send data."
