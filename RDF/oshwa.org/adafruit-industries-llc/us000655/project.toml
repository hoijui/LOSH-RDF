function = "This is the FeatherWing 128x64 OLED: it adds a gorgeous 128x64 monochrome OLED plus 3 user buttons to any Feather main board. These displays are small, only about 1.3\" diagonal, but very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
