    okh:function "The MS8607 provides a factory-calibrated pressure, temperature, and humidity data are recorded as 16-bit values and made available over an I2C bus. Pressure measurements accuracy comes in at +/- 2 hPa, relative humidity at +/- 3% rH, and temperature is good to within 1 degree Celsius. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder." ;
