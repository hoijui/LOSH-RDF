function = "With our SPI FRAM breakout board you can add some FRAM storage to your next DIY project. FRAM allows for a lower power usage and a faster write performance. It's excellent for low-power or inconsistent-power datalogging or data buffering where you want to stream data fast while also keeping the data when there's no power. his particular FRAM chip has 2 Mb (256 KB) of storage, interfaces using SPI, and can run at up to 40 MHz clock rates."
