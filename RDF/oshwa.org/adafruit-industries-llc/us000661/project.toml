function = "The Adafruit AS7341 10-Channel Light / Color Sensor Breakout is a multi-channel spectrometer; a light sensor that is able to detect the amount of light present and the amounts of light within different wavelengths. The AS7341 packs within its 3x2mm footprint 16 different sensors. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder."
