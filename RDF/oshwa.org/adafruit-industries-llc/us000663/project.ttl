    okh:function "This RFID tag is really unique: it works with mobile phones just like other RFID tags, but you can reprogram it over I2C. The tag shows up as an ISO/IEC 15693 (13.56MHz) chip which is readable by phones and tablets. This breakout uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder." ;
