function = "The ICM20948 pairs the MEMS 3-axis accelerometer and gyro with the AK09916 3-axis magnetometer. All 9 axes of measurement are made available thanks to a crew of 16-bit ADCs, diligently converting the raw analog signals from the MEMs sensors to digital readings. This breakout uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder."
