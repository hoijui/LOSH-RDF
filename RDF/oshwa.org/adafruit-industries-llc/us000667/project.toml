function = "The BH1750 provides 16-bit light measurements in lux, the SI unit for measuring light, making it easy to compare against other values like references and measurements from other sensors. The BH1750 can measure from 0 to 65K+ lux, but can be calibrated to measure as much as 100,000 lux! This breakout uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder."
