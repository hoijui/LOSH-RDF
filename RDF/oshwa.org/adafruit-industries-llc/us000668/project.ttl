    okh:function "The PCF8591 is not the highest quality ADC/DAC - with only 8 bits of measurement, but it works well and is fairly inexpensive. Adding a PCF8591 to your electronics project will give four 8-bit analog inputs that you can use to measure voltages from. This breakout uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder." ;
