    okh:function "The DS3502's resistance has a linear relationship to the wiper's setting. Each time you change the wiper, the resistance will change by the same amount. As the wiper setting changes, the amount of resistance depends on where in the wiper's range the current setting is. This breakout uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder." ;
