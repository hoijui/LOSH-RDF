function = "This adorable little board will come in very handy whenever you need a good amount of 5V power. It's the size of a linear regulator, but it's actually a mini-booster! Input 2-5VDC on one side, and get 5V at up to 1A supply on the other. Perfect for use with battery-powered projects with 2 or 3 Alkaline, or a single Lithium battery."
