function = "With the Adafruit Matrix Portal add-on for RGB Matricies, there's never been an easier way to create powerful Internet-connected LED displays. Plug directly into the back of any HUB-75 compatible display (all the ones we stock will work) from 16x32 up to 64x64! Use the included screws to attach the power cable to the power plugs with a common screwdriver, then power it with any USB C power supply. Then code up your project in CircuitPython or Arduino."
