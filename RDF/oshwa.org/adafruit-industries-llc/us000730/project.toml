function = "The Adafruit MagTag combines the new ESP32-S2 wireless module and a 2.9\" grayscale E-Ink display to make a low-power IoT display that can show data on its screen even when power is removed! The ESP32-S2 is great because it builds on the years of code and support for the ESP32 and also adds native USB support so you can use this board with Arduino or CircuitPython! We designed this board to be low-power friendly. During deep sleep (~250uA power draw), you can run for a few weeks between charges."
