function = "Add lots of touch sensors to your next microcontroller project with this easy-to-use 12-channel capacitive touch sensor breakout board. This chip can handle up to 12 individual touchpads with large alligator/croc-clip friendly pads, it's a no-solder solution to capacitive touch sensing. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
