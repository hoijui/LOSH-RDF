function = "The LTR390 has both ambient light and UVA sensing with a peak spectral response between 300 and 350nm. It's also got a very simple I2C interface. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
