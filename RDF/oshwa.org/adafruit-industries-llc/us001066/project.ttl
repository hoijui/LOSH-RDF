    okh:function "The BMP390L has great precision, which makes it excellent for environmental sensing or as a precision altimeter. It is the next-generation of sensors from Bosch and comes with a low-altitude noise as low as 0.1m and super fast conversion time. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
