function = "The FeatherWing sports a 2.13\" tri-color (red, black, and white) display. It has 250x122 black and red ink pixels and a white-ish background. Using our CircuitPython or Arduino libraries, you can create a 'frame buffer' with what pixels you want to have activated and then write that out to the display. This takes a decent amount of memory, so we also tossed a small SRAM chip on the back. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
