    okh:function "The TMP117 is an I2C temperature sensor that will help you easily add temperature measurement and adjustment to your project. It can also monitor the temperature and alert you when corrective action needs to be taken, and has 16-bit resolution, wide operating range, and up to ±0.1°C accuracy. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
