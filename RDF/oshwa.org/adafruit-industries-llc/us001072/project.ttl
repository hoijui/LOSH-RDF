    okh:function "Sensirion Temperature/Humidity sensors are some of the finest & highest-accuracy devices you can get. The SHT40 has an excellent �1.8% typical relative humidity accuracy from 25 to 75% and �0.2 �C typical accuracy from 0 to 75 �C. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
