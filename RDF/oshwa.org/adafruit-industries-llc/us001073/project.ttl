    okh:function "I2C stands for Inter-Integrated-Circuit communications, it's meant for short distances on a PCB or subassembly. But, hey, we're engineers, and we like to push the limits of technology, right? So why not try to have I2C run over a meter long cable, or even longer? Well, if you try to do that you'll quickly run into a number of issues, which can be conveniently solved by an Adafruit LTC4311 active terminator like this one.
