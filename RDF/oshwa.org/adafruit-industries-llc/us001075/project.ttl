    okh:function "The BNO085 by Hillcrest Laboratories takes their 3-axis accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers and packages then alongside an Arm M0 processor running Hillcrest's SH-2 firmware that handles the work of reading the sensors and then converting, packaging, and delivering that data to you. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
