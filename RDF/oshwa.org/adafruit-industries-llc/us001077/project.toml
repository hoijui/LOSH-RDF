function = "This breakout is for a fascinating chip - it looks like an SPI Flash storage chip (like the GD25Q16) but its really an SD card, in an SMT chip format. What that means is that you wire up like an SD card breakout, and use the SD card libraries you already have for your microcontroller. The breakout will act just like a 512 MB sized card with FAT formatting (it's pre-formatted). Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
