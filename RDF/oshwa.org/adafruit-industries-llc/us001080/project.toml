function = "The SGP40 has a 'standard' hot-plate MOX sensor, as well as a small microcontroller that controls power to the plate, reads the analog voltage and provides an I2C interface to read from. Unlike some other sensors, this sensor does not require I2C clock stretching. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
