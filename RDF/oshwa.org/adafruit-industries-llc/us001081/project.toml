function = "The SCD-30 is an NDIR sensor, which is a 'true' CO2 sensor, that will tell you the CO2 PPM (parts-per-million) composition of ambient air. Perfect for environmental sensing, scientific experiments, air quality and ventilation studies, and more. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
