function = "This display is a petite 1.5\" diagonal, but very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. It is made of 128x128 individual grayscale OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip. This display uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
