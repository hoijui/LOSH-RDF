    okh:function "This sensor from AMS is a gas sensor that can detect a wide range of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and is intended for indoor air quality monitoring. This part will measure eCO2 (equivalent calculated carbon-dioxide) concentration, and TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compound) concentration. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
