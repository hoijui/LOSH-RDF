function = "The BMP3xx is the next-generation of sensors from Bosch, and is the upgrade to the BMP280 - with a low altitude noise as low as 0.1m and the same fast conversion time. And like the previous BMP280, you can use I2C or SPI. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
