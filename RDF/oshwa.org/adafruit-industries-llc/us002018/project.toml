function = "It's half USB Key, half Adafruit Trinket, half rotary encoder...it's Rotary Trinkey, the circuit board with a Trinket M0 heart, a NeoPixel glow, and a rotary encoder body. We were inspired by a project where a rotary encoder was soldered onto a QT Py. So we thought, hey what if we made something like that that plugs right into your computer's USB port, with a fully programmable color NeoPixel? This is what we came up with!
