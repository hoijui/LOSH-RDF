function: It's half USB Key, half Adafruit Trinket, half mechanical keeb...it's NeoKey Trinkey, the circuit board with a Trinket M0 heart, a NeoPixel glow, and a Cherry MX-compatible keyswitch. We were inspired by single-key macro pads we've seen. So we thought, hey what if we made something like that that plugs right into your computer's USB port, with a fully programmable color NeoPixel? And this is what we came up with! Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
