function: This absolute pressure sensor, ST LPS22HB (a.k.a LPS22) can quickly and easily measure this air pressure, useful when you want to know about the weather (are we in a low-pressure or high-pressure system?) or to determine altitude, as the air thins out the higher we get above sea level. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
