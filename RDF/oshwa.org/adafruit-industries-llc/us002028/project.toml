function = "Some microcontrollers, especially ARM Cortex-based devicess, don't have any built-in flash! What then? That's where this petite Adafruit 24LC32 I2C EEPROM Breakout comes in to help! With 32 Kbit (4 KByte) of storage, it's just the right amount of simple I2C-controllable storage. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
