function = "Behold, the ST LSM6DSO32: The latest in a long line of quality Accelerometer+Gyroscope 6-DOF IMUs from ST. This IMU is like a big sister to the LSM6DSOX; it has the same pinout and firmware - but the accelerometer component can go up to 32g instead of the normal 16g maximum. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
