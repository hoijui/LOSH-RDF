function: Add motion, direction, and orientation sensing to your project with this all-in-one 9-DOF sensor that is STEMMA QT ready for easy plug-n-play usage. Inside the chip are three sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, the other is a 3-axis magnetometer, and the third is a 3-axis gyroscope. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
