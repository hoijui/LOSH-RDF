function = "Rather than spending weeks or months fiddling with algorithms of varying accuracy and complexity, you can have meaningful sensor data in minutes thanks to the BNO055 - a smart 9-DOF sensor that does the sensor fusion all on its own! You can read the data right over I2C. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
