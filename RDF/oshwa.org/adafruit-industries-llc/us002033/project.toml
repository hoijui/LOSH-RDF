function = "The datasheet for the DS3231 explains that this part is an \"Extremely Accurate Iï¿½C-Integrated RTC/TCXO/Crystal\". And, hey, it does exactly what it says on the tin! This Real Time Clock (RTC) is the most precise you can get in a small, low-power package. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
