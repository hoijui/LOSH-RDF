function: The Adafruit TCA4307 Hot-Swap I2C Buffer breakout here solves the problem of I2C not being very friendly to hot-swapping. It's specifically designed to take a non-hot-swap protocol (I2C) and protect the controller from wayward peripherals messing with the bus during attach/detach. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
