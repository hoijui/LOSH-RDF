function: A new chip means a new QT Py, and the RP2040 is no exception. When we saw this chip we thought "this chip is going to be awesome when we give it the cutie QT Py Treatment", and so we did! This QT Py features the RP2040, and all niceties you know and love about the original QT Py. This board has a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows you to easily add loads of sensors and other devices without soldering.
