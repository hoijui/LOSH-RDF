    okh:function "Howdy keyboard cowboys, are you surfing the information superhighway with a Pi 400? Want a cool heads-up display, or maybe you need to wire up some NeoPixel wetware? Well, we just fenced 12 megabytes of ram and some angled socket header, and it's a major upgrade to our extender board. This bonnet has a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows you to easily add loads of sensors and other devices without soldering. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
