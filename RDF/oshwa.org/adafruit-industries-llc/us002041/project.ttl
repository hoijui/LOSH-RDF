    okh:function "Low cost Lithium Polymer batteries are thin, light, can be regulated down to 3.3V and they're easy to charge. On your phone, there's a little image of a battery cell that tells you the percentage of charge. The Adafruit LC709203F LiPoly / LiIon Fuel Gauge and Battery Monitor does the same thing. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
