function = "The HTU31-D is the third generation of temperature-humidity sensors from TE - and a great follow-up to the popular HTU21-D sensor. Like the HTU21, the '31 is great for sensing temperature and humidity, with excellent specifications.This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
