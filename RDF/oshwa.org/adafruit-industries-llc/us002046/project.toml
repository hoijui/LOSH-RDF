function = "The LIS331HH is capable of measuring ±6g/±12g/±24g on each of its three axes! In addition to their substantial measurement capability, the LIS331s have built-in and configurable high-pass and low-pass filters to adjust the readings to your application. This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
