function: "The LIS331HH is capable of measuring up to \xB124g on each of its three axes! Should that not be enough for you, the H3LIS331 will certainly have you covered. At the reasonable cost of some signal noise at lower \"human-level\" accelerations, the H3LIS331 can measure up to \xB1400g! This sensor uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
