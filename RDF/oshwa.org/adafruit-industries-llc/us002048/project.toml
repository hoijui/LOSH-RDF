function = "We designed this little breakout board after seeing some cool demos for the Raspberry Pi Pico driving an HDMI display. By using some fun 'abuse' of overclocking and the RP2040's PIO system, a low-cost microcontroller can have great looking video output. Great for making demos, or just noodling around with digital video generation. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
