function = "We’re seeing lots of people use CircuitPython for keebs, so we tried our hands at a pro-micro-compatible RP2040 board? We mixed together what we liked most about pro-micro compatible boards with features from our RP2040 boards (boot button can be used for user, 8MB QSPI flash, onboard NeoPixel, jumper for skipping the diode/fuse for high power RGB LEDs or USB hosting). We even got it to all fit on a 2-layer PCB with 7/7 routing – just needed to make the smallest caps and resistors 0402."
