function = "We like the MCP23017 as an expander for its simple capability. It runs from 3V or 5V logic and power, each GPIO drive up to 25mA as an output, or an input, with optional pullup. There are two IRQ pins that are configurable. With 3 address pins, you get 128 GPIO on one I2C bus! This GPIO expander uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without needing to solder.
