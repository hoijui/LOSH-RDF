function: The ATtiny817 is part of the 'next gen' of AVR microcontrollers, and now we have a development/breakout board for it. It's also an Adafruit seesaw board which is a near-universal converter framework which allows you to add and extend hardware support to any I2C-capable microcontroller or microcomputer. This board uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.
