function: Here's a new "round rect" TFT display - it's 1.69" diagonal and has a high-density 220 ppi, 280x240 full color pixels with IPS any-angle viewing. We've seen displays of this caliber used in smartwatches and small electronic devices but they've always been MIPI interface. Finally, we found one that is SPI and has a friendly display driver, so it works with any and all microcontrollers or microcomputers!Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
