function = "The Adafruit LED Glasses Front Panel has 116 2x2mm RGB LEDs, all controlled with an IS31FL3741 I2C Driver that handles the PWM, so it's plug-and-play with almost any microcontroller. There's also six mounting holes for attaching to a glasses frame.This board uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
