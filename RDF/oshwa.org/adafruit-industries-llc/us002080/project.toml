function = "Our family of I2C-friendly user interface elements grows by one with this new product that makes it plug-n-play-easy to add a 75mm long slide potentiometer to any microcontroller or microcomputer with an I2C port. Each breakout is 3\" long and 0.8\" wide, with a single linear slide pot in the center.This board uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
