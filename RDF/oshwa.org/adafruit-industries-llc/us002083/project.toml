function = "The MSA311 is a super small and low-cost accelerometer. It has about everything you'd want: Three-axis sensing, 14-bit resolution, �2g to �16g scaling, I2C, data rate options from 1-500 Hz, as low as 2uA current draw in low power mode, tap, double-tap, orientation & freefall detectionThis board uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
