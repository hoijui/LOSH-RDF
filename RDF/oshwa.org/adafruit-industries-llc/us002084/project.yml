function: This accelerometer can sense up to 200g's of force in three axes (X, Y, Z) and has pins that can be used for either I2C or SPI for easy integration. Built-in motion detection features make shock detection easy to implement. There's two interrupt pins, and any of the interrupts can be mapped to them.This board uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.
