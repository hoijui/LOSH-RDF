    okh:function "This board is designed to be a thin, bluetooth-enabled driver board for our Adafruit LED Glasses RGB LED matrix. That said, it's a perfectly good stand-alone development board for the Nordic nRF52840 chipset, with a very slim design, LiPo battery support, sensors, and a Stemma QT port.This board uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more." ;
