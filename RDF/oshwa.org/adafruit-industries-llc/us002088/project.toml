function = "The SCD-40 is a photoacoustic 'true' CO2 sensor that will tell you the CO2 PPM (parts-per-million) composition of ambient air. Unlike some sensors, the SCD-40 really measures the CO2 concentration! Perfect for environmental sensing, scientific experiments, air quality and ventilation studies, and more.This board uses a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows the sensor to communicate over I2C without soldering.Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more."
