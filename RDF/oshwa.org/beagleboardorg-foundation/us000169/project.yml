function: "Fast track to Embedded Artificial Intelligence. Based on the Texas Instruments AM5729, developers have access to the powerful SoC with the ease of BeagleBone\xAE Black header and mechanical compatibility. BeagleBone\xAE AI makes it easy to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in everyday life via the TI C66x digital-signal-processor (DSP) cores and embedded-vision-engine (EVE) cores supported through an optimized TIDL machine learning OpenCL API with pre-installed tools."
