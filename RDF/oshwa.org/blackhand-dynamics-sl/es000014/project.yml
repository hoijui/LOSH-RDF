function: DynOSSAT-EDU is a CircuitPython compatible, open source nanosatellite development kit designed for makers, students and amateurs. Our aim is to provide the DIY and educational communities with a complete and realistic PocketQube platform (just 5x5 cm!) that includes all the necessary modules for the operation of a real nanosatellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) that would serve as a device for teaching, training or just driving curiosity about the philosophy and technology related to NewSpace.
