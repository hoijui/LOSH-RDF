    okh:function "We tried other microcontrollers with primary school children and in the end it was clear: We need one that the children can handle without easily producing short circuits. A board that teachers, pupils and students can use in the classroom without necessarily having to distribute and solder other small parts. A board that is loud and colourful. And last but not least, we also need the possibility for children and teachers to bring the minicomputer to life with a simple programming language." ;
