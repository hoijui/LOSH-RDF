There are three components to this project: 
(1) A kit of robust physical and digital components with unique names and specific geometry which can be combined in a modular fashion. 
(2) A system of communicating the interactions of these components. 
(3) A way to easily physically manufacture complex assemblies made up of modules, in a variety of materials reliably of considerable size.""" ;
