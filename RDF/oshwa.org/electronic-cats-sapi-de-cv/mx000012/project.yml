function: '"Ajolote" badges are unbearably cute. Created especially to teach anyone to solder their first electronic card; It is a very basic soldering kit and suitable for all ages.

  This "Ajolote" kit has two colored LEDs with different light patterns! The switch allows you to turn the device on or off and it also contains a battery holder.

  Once the badge kit is soldered and the battery inserted, the badge LED will blink and change color for approximately 24 hours.Very basic soldering skills are required'
