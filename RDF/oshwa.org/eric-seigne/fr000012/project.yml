function: 'gasblender.org is a project for helping tek divers to build their own gas analyzer (oxygen for nitrox and helium+oxygen for trimix).


  the goal is to produce documentation and some hardware (mainboard) ... and maybe a full open hardware tool to analyse helium (but for that we need money so there is a crowndfunding project in starting blocks).


  we hope to have openhardware "certification" before launching our funding campain.'
