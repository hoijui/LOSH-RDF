function = "The purpose of HiMinds wireless environmental sensor project is to develop a rechargeable battery-operated wireless sensor that can measure:\n\nTemperature with ±1.0°C accuracy\nBarometric pressure with 1 hPa absolute accuracy\nHumidity with ±3% accuracy\n\nIt is ESP32-based and has incorporated the BME280 and the BQ27441-G1 fuel gauge into the design. It is designed to fit into a CBRS01VWH enclosure from CAMDENBOSS. The work is based on OSHWA UID\nBG000019, OLIMEX ESP32-DEVKIT-LIPO."
