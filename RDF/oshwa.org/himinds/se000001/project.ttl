Temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy
Barometric pressure with 1 hPa absolute accuracy
Humidity with ±3% accuracy

It is ESP32-based and has incorporated the BME280 and the BQ27441-G1 fuel gauge into the design. It is designed to fit into a CBRS01VWH enclosure from CAMDENBOSS. The work is based on OSHWA UID
BG000019, OLIMEX ESP32-DEVKIT-LIPO.""" ;
