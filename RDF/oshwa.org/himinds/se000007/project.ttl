    okh:function """The purpose of HiMinds wireless environmental sensor project is to develop a rechargeable battery-operated wireless sensor that can measure: 

- Carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels
- Temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy
- Barometric pressure with 1 hPa absolute accuracy
- Humidity with ±3% accuracy
- Volatile organic compounds (VOC) gas sensor
- Tamper detection
- Sound level meter

It is designed to fit into a CBRS01VWH enclosure from CAMDENBOSS. 
The work is based on OSHWA UID BG000019.""" ;
