function: The ECG Patient Simulator generates an ECG signal in a 3-Lead or 5-Lead format.  This is for quickly diagnosing ECG cables, electrodes and ECG Monitors in a medical technology workshop, operating room, recovery room, etc.  By using two push buttons, the heart rate can be changed in the range of 30Bpm to 240Bpm in steps of 30Bpm.  This project consists of an electronics part with schematic and PCB and a 3D printed housing.
