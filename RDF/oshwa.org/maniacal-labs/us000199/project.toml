function = "The Engravinator is a laser engraver designed as an open source project with all the designs, builds and instructions available for free.\n\nInstead of being a laser engraver where you bring the piece to the engraver, we have designed the Engravinator to be an engraver that you bring to your work piece. For example, if you are building a large piece of furniture, you would clamp the Engravinator down to your work piece to engrave your maker&#x27;s mark."
