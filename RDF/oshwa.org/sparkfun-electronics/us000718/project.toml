function = "With a clear view of the sky, the Artemis Global Tracker (AGT) allows you to send and receive short data messages. It works anywhere in the world, including the polar regions, far beyond the reach of WiFi and GSM networks. Maybe you want to transmit pressure, temperature or humidity readings from the top of a mountain? Or use it to send data from a travelling balloon sat? Or use it to control your remote equipment out in the field."
