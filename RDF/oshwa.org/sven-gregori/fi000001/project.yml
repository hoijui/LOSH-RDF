function: 'The USB MIDI keyboard that has all it takes to play every hit pop songs ever: four chords. Acting like a regular MIDI controller, its four buttons will play the I-V-vi-IV chord progression in any key, any speed, and a variety of playback modes - from simple chords to arpeggios. It''s even shaped like a piano, to give you the real feel of playing an actual instrument.'
