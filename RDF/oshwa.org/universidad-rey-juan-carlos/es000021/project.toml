function = "This project is an automatic geological simulator, with readily available and low-cost parts. The parts that don't comply with this, have been designed in Python for FreeCAD, which implies that this model's CAD design making it a parameterizable model, so that it is easy to modify its dimensions.\nThis simulator reproduces faults and tectonic processes on a small scale. For this reason the model moves at very slow speeds, between 1 mm/h and 100 mm/h."
