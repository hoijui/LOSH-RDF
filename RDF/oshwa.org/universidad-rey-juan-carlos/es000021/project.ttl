The parts that don't comply with this, have been designed in Python for FreeCAD, which implies that this model's CAD design making it a parameterizable model, so that it is easy to modify its dimensions.
This simulator reproduces faults and tectonic processes on a small scale. For this reason the model moves at very slow speeds, between 1 mm/h and 100 mm/h.""" ;
