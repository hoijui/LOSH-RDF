function: 'This project is an automatic geological simulator, with readily available and low-cost parts. The parts that don''t comply with this, have been designed in Python for FreeCAD, which implies that this model''s CAD design making it a parameterizable model, so that it is easy to modify its dimensions.

  This simulator reproduces faults and tectonic processes on a small scale. For this reason the model moves at very slow speeds, between 1 mm/h and 100 mm/h.'
