function: "The Hactus is a hackable art piece. It embodies the visual of a cactus succulent with its two interlocking green perfboards paired with a handmade concrete flower pot.  The user can keep it as-is, use it as a pencil holder, or hack it to their hearts desire with the 1566 solder points across the two PCBs. The Hactus is the hacker\u2019s cactus and an original design of Chloe Madison"
