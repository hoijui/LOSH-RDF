    okh:function "The wind-tunnel setup consists of three units: the wind-tunnel, the control and the measuring unit connected to the PC which provides appropriate airflow velocity up to 5 m/s. The measuring unit is based on Arduino UNO with Rev.P. The main benefits of the 3D printing of wind-tunnel parts are the ease of construction, assembly and ease of customisation in case of further development. Experience with Arduino platform is required and supervision from a qualified electric engineering professional." ;
