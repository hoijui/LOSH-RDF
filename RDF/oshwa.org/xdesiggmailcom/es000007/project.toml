function = "EchidnaShield is an Open Source project aimed at facilitating the learning of physical systems programming in the last Primary and Secondary courses. To this end, a shield has been designed for Arduino, thinking about its use with visual programming environments. \nBy having integrated sensors and actuators, it eliminates the need to wire, minimizing electronics errors, which leads to an increase in the time devoted to programming and knowledge of the components."
