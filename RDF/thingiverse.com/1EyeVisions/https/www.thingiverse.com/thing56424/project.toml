function = "Are you an archery class instructor or coach?  Are you working with archers who have taken many hours of archery classes and developed some very bad habits before they got to you?  I present to you, the grip grip stop.  It's just a simple thin strip that you can double sticky tape to the back of the grip just below the pivot point to help remind the more stubborn student to stop trying to choke the bow to death.  They fail to understand two simple things.  One, the bow doesn't breath.  Two, no one is trying to take it from them.  ><  I have tried to model the bumps to be big enough to annoy but not pointy so that they shouldn't hurt.  Just give a not so subtle reminder.  Relax that lead hand."
