function: This a dust collector, guard, splitter for saws that were made before saws came with riving knives standard. The riving knife only works for square cuts as it is built in to the throat plate. I have been using a throat plate for years, and this is just an upgrade, mostly so I can dust collect off of the backside of the blade. Keep the sheet good dust out of my lungs!
