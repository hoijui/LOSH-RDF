function: "Yes, this is another thing for attaching a camera to an Ikea lamp.  This was inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18781 except rather than replace the lamp, I augment it.  It is made to be inserted between the lamp cover/diffuser and the body.  \r\n\r\nOh, what I've uploaded is slightly modified from the one I'm using... I removed a bunch of extraneous material so it's faster to print (and better for the environment).  So it's possible (but unlikely) that this may not work for you!   I'll get around to printing the revised version some day... \r\n\r\nIkea Lersta: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20110903/"
