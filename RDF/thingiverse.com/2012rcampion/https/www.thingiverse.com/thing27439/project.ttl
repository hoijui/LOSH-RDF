    okh:function """A widget to mount your smartphone on a tripod, replacing the rubber bands you used before.\r
\r
It is designed to fit the original Droid X with an extended battery.  (The battery actually extends out the back, requiring a new, larger backplate.  That is why it says ``X2'' on the back.)  If you want to use a Droid X or X2 with original battery, you can modify the Inventor file or the STL so that the gap between the fingers is about 1/32" tighter.\r
\r
You can also use it without the tripod as a kickstand for your phone.""" ;
