College of Technology we have some modifications to this model. If you have already printed this model, do not attach the Counterweight rail to the Base And tape 2 Quarter to the right side of the Tilt-N-Trap. \r\n\r\nErickPHD Said \r\n\r\n\"Testing shows a reasonably reliable trigger at 27 grams but the average mouse is 10-25g so my class thought that it needed to be a bit more sensitive\"\r\n\r\nADD two quarters and removing the Counter weight rail should give a More sensitive Design. Check out the picture to see the modified design\r\n\r\n03-04-2010 : First Model has been printed!
