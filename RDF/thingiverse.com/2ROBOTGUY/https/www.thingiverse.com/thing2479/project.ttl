How many times did you lose that model rocket you spent hours on as a kid? Stuck in a tree or on top of your neighbor's roof  that was alway my luck. What if I told you that you can rekindle that childhood spark with your 3D printed model rocket? Don't worry about all of your hard work going to waste , just print yourself another and go!""" ;
