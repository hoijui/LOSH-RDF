function: "This Item is still a work in progress. Need to figure out how to add hinges to make the rocket lets flip out. Help requested!  \n\n\nHow many times did you lose that model rocket you spent hours on as a kid? Stuck in a tree or on top of your neighbor's roof  that was alway my luck. What if I told you that you can rekindle that childhood spark with your 3D printed model rocket? Don't worry about all of your hard work going to waste , just print yourself another and go!"
