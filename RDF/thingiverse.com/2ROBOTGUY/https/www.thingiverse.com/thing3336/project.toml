function = "The Yoshimoto Cube is a polyhedral  mechanical puzzle  toy invented in 1971 by Japanese Naoki Yoshimoto (åx90‰æœ¬ç›´è²´, Yoshimoto Naoki). The cube is made up of eight interconnected cubes and it is capable of folding and unfolding itself in a cyclic fashion. You can keep folding, or unfolding the cube, indefinitely. Once folded, the cube can be turned into two rhombic  stellated dodecahedrons. Yoshimoto discovered that these two shapes could pieced together into a square when he was finding different ways he could split a cube equally in half.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------UPDATE------------------------------------\r\n6/13/2010\r\n\r\nYoshimoto Cube has just been blogged about on Makezine\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/06/3d-printable_yoshimoto_cube.html\r\n\r\n6/13/2010\r\n\r\nAs suggested by Michael Ragan,\r\n\r\n\\\"Now the n+1 step would be to design a printable mold for this component, so you could print the mold and cast, what is it--16 of these units that you need to make the cube? Then find the right kinda tape to make the hinges. \\\"\r\n\r\nI have added a two different molds. A open part mold or a 4 part mold. More information below.   \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSaw this Puzzle on Makezine yesterday and wanted one. \r\nhttp://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/06/the_yoshimoto_cube.html\r\n\r\nThe bad news is the Yoshimoto Cube cost $65.00!!! Ouch \r\nhttp://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10451&storeId=10001&parent_category_rn=11480&categoryId=21658&partNumber=67866&LangId=-1&promoCode=8K119&cid=GPS07230901\r\n\r\nAfter two hour of modeling in SolidWorks I was to model the whole assembly! \r\n\r\nMore information and how to tape up the model can be found here.\r\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Crazy-Star-Cube-!/\r\n\r\nLater I will add an Active hinge for easy assembly. But till then enjoy! \r\n\r\n  I am building my Mendel right now, So I will not be able to print this model for a month or so. But would really like to see it working! In SolidWorks this model works great! If you are thinking of building one tell me and Ill add your pictures & Videos if you make then!"
