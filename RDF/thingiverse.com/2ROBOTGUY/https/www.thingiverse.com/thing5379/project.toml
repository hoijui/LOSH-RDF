function = "Nice holder to keep you IPHONE or IPOD of the ground while charging. Large print, can only be made on Mendel right now. But I bet somebody will chop it up for there makerbot to print. Also a folding charger would be cool. Possibly some M3 screws and nuts, or just 3mm filament?  \r\n\r\nDo you like this design and want more great projects? Donate a dollar or two to help order future supplies :-) http://bit.ly/2kbP40C\r\n\r\n Want to mail me something?
