function: "DON'T BE LIKE ALL THE OTHER DADS AND BUY A NIGHT LIGHT, PRINT A CUSTOM BEETHOVEN NIGHT LIGHT! COULD BE A VERY FUN PROJECT TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n I CURRENTLY HAVE MINE CONNECTED TO MY RAMPS SHIELD INSTEAD OF THE GREEN LED INDICATOR. MAKES ME SMILE WHEN HE TURNS ON :)\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLY A TRICOLR LED WOULD BE A COOL INSERT! OPTIONS FOR HIM ARE ENDLESS. WHY TURN ON AN LED FOR TESTING WHEN YOU COULD USE BEETHOVEN INSTEAD!"
