function = "Simple and easy PCB Vise to print. Less hardware than others PCB VICES out there. \r\n\r\n  Idea came from this design:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8194\r\nProblem was I did not have any Smooth rod. Problem solved.\r\n\r\nCan only be printed on Mendels right now. The parts are 175mm & 125mm long. Possible smaller version coming soon. It should be possible to design the whole unit out of plastic parts (minus the M4. bolts, washers, & wing nuts) This first model was a proof of concept & works great!\r\n\r\n\r\n****Coupling Parts Already have a .3mm offset to accommodate for your printer.  \r\n\r\n When Wing nut is tightened, Very strong grip between both parts. No wobble at all."
