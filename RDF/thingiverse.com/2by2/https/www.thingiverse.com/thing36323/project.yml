function: "I had troubles with camera noises picked up by my sensitive microphone. The basic microphone mount transferred too much camera handling noise to the microphone.   \r\nSo I designed a camera Shock mount for my Sony EX-1. It's meant for a mount not longer than 5 CM, but I've also include a 7 CM mount."
