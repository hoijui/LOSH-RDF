function = "The most fun part about 3D printers is that you can design non existed things. For me, Duplo is a great way to experiment with (And have a happy kid in the process). After the straight rails to test the compatibility and interchangeable with the original Duplo (see: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36017 ) I've taken it a step further. And here I present the hexagon railroad crossing. Fully compatible with the existed Duplo rails.  \r\n\r\nThe bottom is designed that it fits Duplo in every direction.   \r\n\r\nIf you like it and print one yourself, please share a picture. I always find it fun to see others using my designs."
