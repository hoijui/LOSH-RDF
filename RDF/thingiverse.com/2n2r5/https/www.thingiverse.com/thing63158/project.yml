function: "Rev 2  \nChanged the mount to make this a clip-on mount. This holds more secure now. Printed in white, it's on the top of my printer. You may need to view the full sized image to see it.  \n\n\nThis guide is for the Solidoodle G3 or 3G ... which ever one it is :-P The guide clips on to the top back rail and helps give the filament a better angle into the extruder. I left a lot of slack so that it would fit easily and slide on the rail. I will include the DXF file so that you can change it if you want. Enjoy :)"
