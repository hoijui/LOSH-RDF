function = "Update 3/25/13 REV 1.5:\r\n\r\nI made quite a few changes to the original design of the parts, for the better I think. I am planning on using the 3 pulleys that I just printed out on the job tomorrow. We are pulling a long section of fiber and are short handed. I am hoping to use these in place of some bodies. The plastic will be nice because there is very little risk of cutting into the outer jacket. I made use of the Acetone bath technique for finishing these pulleys. It looks like the acetone and ABS solution really helped seal the outer shell. I am hoping they resist cracking at the seams now. See the change log for more info and see the photos for the updated version.\r\n\r\n\r\nREV 1.5**\r\nChange Log:\r\n- Increased diameter of hole in the roller and frame. There is now minimal (almost no) post processing of the parts required. \r\n\r\n- Added a single roller to the design.\r\n\r\n- Removed decorative loop on top of frame\r\n\r\n- Decreased diameter and changed the shape of the end cap post to reduce overall post processing. End cap may require a touch of glue to stay secure now.\r\n\r\n- Changed to shape of end cap receiver in the rod to reflect changes in end cap post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREV 1.0\r\n\r\nI made this just to have something to play with. I might print another and hang my spools with them. As of right now this thing doesn't fit together with out some modifications. I had to ream out all of the holes with an exact-o knife and ended up glueing on the end cap of the rod. I am still new to 3D printing but I can see that this design does not compliment the material. It is still fun to play with though. Let me know what you end up using it for. I included the sketchup file. Feel free to fix and repost. :)"
