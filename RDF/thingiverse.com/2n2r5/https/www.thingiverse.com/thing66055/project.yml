function: "This a universal clip-on mount for my Web Cam and it just so happens to be very useful for other things as well. I am going to make more modules such as a magnify glass holder, flash light holder, generic alligator clip and some others. There is a support clip provided that adds a lot of stability when used on the solidoodle Gen 3 printer. The extentions add ~2 inches of swiveling length. I will work on making a heavy duty version that can hold more weight without drooping. The clip was designed to hold onto the 1.1 mm thick support of the solidoodle. It should flex to accommodate up 2 mm. \r\n\r\nAs always, I included the Google Sketchup file. There are some spare mounts if you are interested in creating your own holder. I can make a new mount if you give me the dimensions of the rail or thing that you want to mount it on."
