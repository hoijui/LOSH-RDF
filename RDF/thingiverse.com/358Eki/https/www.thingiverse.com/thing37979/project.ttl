    okh:function """This is  2Watt 800RPM push blower for my beer can Stirling engine. \r
\r
ItÂ´s pushing fair amount of air with silent operation. It would work with 3 or 4 blades, but with 6 its looking more respectable. Also spinner is more for looks than aerodynamics here.\r
\r
It is out from CH10SM airfoil data (slightly modified and high angle of attack for lower power and speeds).\r
\r
Time to share if someone finds a use for this - under 1000 RPM, low power and accelerations only. \r
\r
You can just imagine to fly with this - unfortunately design is no good for that and will be dissapointment with whatever material and engine.   \r
For general home use this fan is quite "directional" with efficient narrow air flow several meters away...\r
\r
Now I revealed you that this is really not optimized for doing anything useful. Take care.""" ;
