function = "Desktop lamp with my face on it! The face was generated using facegen with their automatic face modeler ( www.facegen.com ).

In full disclosure, it doesn't quite look like me.. but I'm also new to the tool.  \r\nModel was printed on an up! printer ( pp3dp.com )  \r\nMy intent is for this product to be Open Hardware, under the TAPR OHL: tapr.org/TAPR_Open_Hardware_License_v1.0.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nEDIT check this out!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1T-cU5-fO8"
