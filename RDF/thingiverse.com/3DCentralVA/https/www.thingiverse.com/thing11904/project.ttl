    okh:function """Motivation: I constantly find myself in need of a small amount of light at will, and the cell phone doesn't always cut it. My goal is to build a small but powerful flashlight ring.\r
\r
Details:\r
I've tried two switch mechanisms so far.  The first one had the head slide laterally, perpendicular to the finger, but it wasn't quite comfortable. This present model slides instead forward and backward. This also is not ideal.. it requires both hands to turn on and off, and the top is prone to falling off. I think the next version will try to have a twisting activation instead.\r
\r
Software:\r
Model was designed in openscadpy (first project, sorry for the poor state of the code): github.com/hmeyer/openscadpy\r
\r
Hardware:\r
Model was printed on an up! printer ( pp3dp.com )\r
\r
My intent is for this product to be Open Hardware, under the TAPR OHL: tapr.org/TAPR_Open_Hardware_License_v1.0.txt""" ;
