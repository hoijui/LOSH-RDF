Instead of solder, wires, and breadboards, OpenSCAD generates a peg-board PCB and component holder, and a circuit can be hand-wound together with conductive thread.  \r\n\r\nThis code base is intended to replace conventional etched PCBs, initially for very simple applications. Included is a basic feature set, described in the Instructions. The pictures and uploaded STL files are for a simple circuit which demonstrates these features: a battery holder (I used 3 watch batteries instead of AAs to quickly and easily step up the voltage and save plastic and time), a momentary push-button, a toggle switch, and an LED holder.  \r\n\r\nSo far I have printed a proof-of-concept on my Up! (pp3dp), and I've found best results with this type of conductive thread:  \r\nhttp://www.sparkfun.com/products/10118  \r\n\r\nCheck out the instructions for details and next steps.  \r\n\r\nAlso check out the etsy shop and find us on Facebook! https://www.etsy.com/shop/CarryTheWhat?  \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/carry.the.what.replications"
