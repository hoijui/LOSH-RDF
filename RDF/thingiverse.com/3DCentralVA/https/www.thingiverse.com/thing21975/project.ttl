The goal of this project is to enable the personal manufacturing of simple electronics, especially for Open Source Hardware -- with nothing except a 3D printer, your hands or equivalent, and the basic high-technology electronic components (capacitors, motors, transistors, etc -- but will eventually encompass ICs, microcontrollers etc). Instead of solder, wires, and breadboards, OpenSCAD generates a peg-board PCB and component holder, and a circuit can be hand-wound together with conductive thread.  \r
\r
This code base is intended to replace conventional etched PCBs, initially for very simple applications. Included is a basic feature set, described in the Instructions.  \r
\r
You can buy a lamp built around this design at https://www.etsy.com/listing/154340925/3d-printed-led-desk-lamp?ref=shop_home_active  \r

Also check us out on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/carry.the.what.replications  !  \r
\r
Detailed instructions for use can be found on http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Circuit-Boards-for-solder-free-printab/ , as part of the Make-It-Real Challenge (so your vote would be greatly appreciated!).   \r

If you want to practice your trace wrapping, and would rather build something useful, I'd suggest building the LED Flashlight http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22052 or Desk Lamp http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27389 !""" ;
