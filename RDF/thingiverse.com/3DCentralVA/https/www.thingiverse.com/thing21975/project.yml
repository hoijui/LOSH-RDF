function: "You can support us by visiting our Etsy! http://etsy.me/16o3ZGE  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enable the personal manufacturing of simple electronics, especially for Open Source Hardware -- with nothing except a 3D printer, your hands or equivalent, and the basic high-technology electronic components (capacitors, motors, transistors, etc -- but will eventually encompass ICs, microcontrollers etc). Instead of solder, wires, and breadboards, OpenSCAD generates a peg-board PCB and component holder, and a circuit can be hand-wound together with conductive thread.  \r\n\r\nThis code base is intended to replace conventional etched PCBs, initially for very simple applications. Included is a basic feature set, described in the Instructions.  \r\n\r\nYou can buy a lamp built around this design at https://www.etsy.com/listing/154340925/3d-printed-led-desk-lamp?ref=shop_home_active  \r\n\r\nAlso check us out on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/carry.the.what.replications  !  \r\n\r\nDetailed instructions for use can be found on http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Circuit-Boards-for-solder-free-printab/ , as part of the Make-It-Real Challenge (so your vote would be greatly appreciated!).   \r\n\r\nIf you want to practice your trace wrapping, and would rather build something useful, I'd suggest building the LED Flashlight http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22052 or Desk Lamp http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27389 !"
