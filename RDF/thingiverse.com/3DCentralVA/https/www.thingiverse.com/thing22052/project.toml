function = "This is an example printed electronic, using the solder-free 3D-PCB library http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21975  \r\n\r\nIt is an LED flashlight, made entirely out of printed parts and 4 lengths of conductive thread, plus 2 batteries and 4 LEDs.  \r\n\r\nDetailed instructions for buildling this, as well as for using 3D-PCB in general: http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Circuit-Boards-for-solder-free-printab/ , as part of the Make-It-Real Challenge (so your vote would be greatly appreciated!).   \r\n\r\nNote: If you are thinking to build, I suggest first test-printing the electronics_top, along with a switch_toggle and a peg_cap. I haven't tested it on many printers, and these pieces have the finest tuned tolerances  \r\n\r\nYou can find carrythewhat? on Facebook, too! https://www.facebook.com/carry.the.what.replications"
