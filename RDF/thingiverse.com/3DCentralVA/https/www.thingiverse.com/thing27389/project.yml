function: "Check out our Etsy for all of our 3D printed awesomeness!\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/CarryTheWhat\r\n\r\nThis is the fully functional solder-free version of the snap-together mini lamp. Besides a 3D printer, all you need is some LEDs and some conductive thread like this: http://members.shaw.ca/ubik/thread/order.html  \r\n\r\nIt's a work in progress because there are still some kinks to work out, and I'm not sure what LEDs I want to use yet.   \r\n\r\nI used v0.2 of the 3D-PCB library, which has tolerances calibrated for the Makerbot Replicator.  \r\n\r\nThe \"bulb\" of this lamp is an array that can hold 6 LEDs, and it snaps into the peg that holds the lamp shade on.  \r\n\r\nSome of the arm pieces have an added peg so that the conductive thread can run down the arm to the base (on each side) without overlapping.  \r\n\r\nThe base has been adapted to accommodate 2xAAA batteries and a toggle switch.  \r\n\r\nThis model was made in blender, using the 3D-PCB openscad exports."
