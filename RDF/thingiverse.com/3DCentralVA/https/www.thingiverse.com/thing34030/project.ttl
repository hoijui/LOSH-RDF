\r
You can buy the copter on Amazon prime for $60:  \r
http://www.amazon.com/UDI-Axis-Stablized-Quadcopter-Helicopter/dp/B0095BXACK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359084783&sr=8-1&keywords=udi+u816  \r
\r
Or if you buy more direct ~$40: http://www.banggood.com/Wholesale-Udi-U816-2_4g-4ch-4-axis-Mini-Rc-Remote-Control-Ufo-360-Eversion-Helicopter-p-48619.html  \r
\r
And to support the development of new designs, I have started selling the completed thing on etsy and Tindie:  \r
https://www.etsy.com/shop/CarryTheWhat?  \r
https://www.tindie.com/shops/CarryTheWhat/rc-quad-copter-3d-printed-frame/  \r
\r
It comes with a 2.4ghz radio transmitter, and a decent one at that. 2 batteries, extra blades... but a flimsy plastic circuit cover.  \r
\r
The quadcopter itself is about 30g, and about 7 inches from tip to tip.  \r
\r
The printed frame in it's current form is about 15g -- the quadcopter has plenty of surplus thrust to carry it. The extra inertia is actually pretty useful for keeping control.  \r
\r
I was unable, however, to successfully print any of the blades that have been uploaded...""" ;
