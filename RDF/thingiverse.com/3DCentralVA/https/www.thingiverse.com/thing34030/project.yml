function: "This is an add-on to the greatest helicopter toy I've ever played with: the UDI U816.   \r\n\r\nYou can buy the copter on Amazon prime for $60:  \r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/UDI-Axis-Stablized-Quadcopter-Helicopter/dp/B0095BXACK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359084783&sr=8-1&keywords=udi+u816  \r\n\r\nOr if you buy more direct ~$40: http://www.banggood.com/Wholesale-Udi-U816-2_4g-4ch-4-axis-Mini-Rc-Remote-Control-Ufo-360-Eversion-Helicopter-p-48619.html  \r\n\r\nAnd to support the development of new designs, I have started selling the completed thing on etsy and Tindie:  \r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/CarryTheWhat?  \r\nhttps://www.tindie.com/shops/CarryTheWhat/rc-quad-copter-3d-printed-frame/  \r\n\r\nIt comes with a 2.4ghz radio transmitter, and a decent one at that. 2 batteries, extra blades... but a flimsy plastic circuit cover.  \r\n\r\nThe quadcopter itself is about 30g, and about 7 inches from tip to tip.  \r\n\r\nThe printed frame in it's current form is about 15g -- the quadcopter has plenty of surplus thrust to carry it. The extra inertia is actually pretty useful for keeping control.  \r\n\r\nI was unable, however, to successfully print any of the blades that have been uploaded..."
