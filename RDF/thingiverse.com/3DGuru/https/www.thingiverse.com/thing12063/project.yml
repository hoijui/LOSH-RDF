function: This design is for a floor lamp that has a switch on the floor lamp's shaft. Some floor lamp switches can break due to a thin flange that can break over time that is on the inside of the lamp switch (that part is replaced by Switch Knob Part 2 of 2 for Floor Lamp - also available here on Thingiverse).
