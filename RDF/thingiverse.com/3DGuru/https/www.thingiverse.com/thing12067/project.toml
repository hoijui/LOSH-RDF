function = "This design is for a floor lamp that has a switch on the floor lamp's shaft. Some floor lamp mechanical switches can break due to a thin flange on their inner shaft that can break over time (this thin flange is held on the inside of the lamp switch's retaining nut). This flange is what keeps the lamp's on/off switch attached to the lamp. Switch Knob Part 2 of 2 for Floor Lamp replaces the part that has a broken flange. Use this part with \"Switch Knob Part 1 of 2\" for Floor Lamp - this part is also available on Thingiverse. \"Switch Knob Part 1 of 2 for Floor Lamp\" is the cap for this part."
