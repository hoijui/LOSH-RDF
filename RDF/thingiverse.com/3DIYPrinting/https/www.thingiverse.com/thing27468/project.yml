function: "This is a parametric robotic claw that I have designed. The purpose is to allow the claw design to accommodate a variety of objects to lift. The example I have built has a reduction gear stage to increase the servo power and to widen the profile allowing the claw to grip cubic blocks of 100mm edges. The SCAD design allows selection of the number of gear stages, length of the arms, beam thickness, as well as a few other parameters. With this design you can generate any claw your robot could need.\r\n\r\nAm example of the claw operating can be seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ribNNGnRoTQ\r\n\r\nand here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxc98augCaA"
