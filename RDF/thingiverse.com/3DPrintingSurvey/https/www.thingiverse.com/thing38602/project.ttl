\r
This is my first post here, and I just wanted to thank you all for being so helpful.  What a truly amazing community.\r
\r
Anyway, I have something exciting to announce!\r
\r
A group of us are putting together the biggest, most up-to-date and comprehensive report about the state of open-source 3D printing technologies.  It will give the community a lot more exposure and also help people who are just getting into 3D printing figure out where to start. It will be a big benefit to experienced people too.\r
\r
It's part of what I'm doing to give back to the community. I already have some pretty cool channels lined up to distribute the report once it's complete.\r
\r
I need your help.\r
\r
Even if you only have 5 minutes, would you mind visiting http://3dprintingsurvey.org and putting in your 2 cents?\r
\r
It will make a huge difference. Your opinion is really valuable right now!\r
\r
I'm really looking forward to hear what you have to say:\r

Yours,\r
