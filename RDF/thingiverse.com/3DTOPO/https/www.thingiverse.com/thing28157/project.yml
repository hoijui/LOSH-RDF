function: "This derivative makes several changes to its ancestor. The most obvious change I removed the perch and added a predator guard instead. I read from many sources that a perch is never needed for the inhabitants and only serves as perch for a predator to eat them instead.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the predator guard is to add 1.5 inches between the entrance and the nesting.\r\n\r\nI added air vents on the top front and back and 4 small drains at the bottom. These help make for a healthy nest.\r\n\r\nI could not find any 3mm plywood at my local Home Depot, so I changed the depth of all the finger joints to accommodate 5mm plywood. Interesting, this is also works for the width of common shipping box cardboard. I made a great cardboard version too.\r\n\r\nI also made some of the joints a little larger so that it could be practically cut with a CNC machine as the one in the picture was cut (while I finish work on my new laser cutter). It will cut fine on a laser cutter too.\r\n\r\nThe birdhouse in the picture has not been glued yet."
