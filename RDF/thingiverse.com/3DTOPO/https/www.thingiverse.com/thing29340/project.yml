function: "I made the angled bevels match the same angle as my tripod head, I made it considerably thinner for faster/cheaper prints. Resized to fit perfectly in my Manfrotto 700RC2 fluid head.\r\n\r\nI was at first a bit skeptical of this design; I was concerned that the iPhone could slip out, but it is able to firmly grasp the iPhone even upside-down (see photo)."
