function = "This thing is for mounting a focus lens directly to a Reci W6 laser tube. I think it should work as is on any Reci tube, but it parameterized, so it can easily be adapted for other tubes.\r\n\r\nWhy would you want to mount the lens directly to the tube? I suppose for most setups it would only be used for testing the laser. For my purposes, I plan on moving the whole laser tube on my large CNC machine, so I should be able to put this to good use (I am not going to steer the beam, I am going to steer the whole tube).\r\n\r\nWorks great. Very snug fit on both the laser and the laser head. Video of it in action here (it is the green part):\r\nhttp://youtu.be/on1uARh9xOU\r\n\r\nThe laser head I am using is this one: http://lightobject.com/1820mm-Laser-head-w-air-assisted-Ideal-for-K40-machine-P701.aspx\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to TrevM for making the really useful thread library!"
