function = "This thing will allow you to mount a limit switch to the height specified above the mounting bolts. I am using 80/20, but should work with any T slot, bolts, screws or fasteners. Features adjustable slots for the limit switch.\r\n\r\nThis thing is completely 100% parametric. It is super easy to customize the: height above the T-Slot, the limit switch hole spacing, hole sizes, thickness, mount width, etc.\r\n\r\nBecause it is so customizable, I hope that it can be used for many installations.\r\n\r\nAll units are in MM. Enjoy."
