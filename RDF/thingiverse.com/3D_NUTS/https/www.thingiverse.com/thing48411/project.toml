function = "Has tunnel for speaker for better sound. I recently found out that this will work with the HTC One X, but have not tested it.\r\n\r\nI just got this back from Shapeways. Unfortunately it was 2mm less wide than it should have been. I had to modify it a LOT using an exacto knife. \r\n\r\nAfter I modified it, I tested the speaker tunnel and it works great!!\r\n\r\nLet me know if you like it!! I'll have a full case up soon ;)"
