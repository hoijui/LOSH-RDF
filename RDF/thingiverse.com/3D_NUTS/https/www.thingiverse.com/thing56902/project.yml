function: "This is my first stab at a whole case. This phone case has a speaker tunnel, just like my previous stand which worked awesome. I'm getting this printed now, hopefully this will work out well too.  The bulge in the back is only 3mm deeper, and the extra space at the bottom is only 9 mm longer. Let me know what you think!!\r\n\r\nI should have some new designs shortly after I test this base model."
