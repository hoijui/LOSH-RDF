function = "My car's dashboard is angled too much, which makes my GPS stare at the sky and reflect a lot of glare. This wedge is to go between the dashboard and the GPS's base plate, so that the screen can be angled better. Countersunk screw holes for easy mounting. Angle is 20 degrees. Diameter is 7cm which should work with most GPS bases.\r\nMy next version will have a curve to match the dashboard but this one will work all the same."
