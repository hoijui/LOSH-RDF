function = "Self-defense \"fashion\" keychain. This is based on one that a friend of mine has, called a \"stinger.\" I like this design because it's just as good as brass knuckles but fits better in your pocket and doesn't constrain your fingers-- you can let go of it quickly.  \nConvenient hole for keychain.  \n\nIf you like my designs, please consider Bitcoin donations: 1PyXaZGVyMXgAVC4xTPdu2wKwtZjGteudx"
