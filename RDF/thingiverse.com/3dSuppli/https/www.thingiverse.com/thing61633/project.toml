function = "Basically this is just kludgineer's orginal Y Mount Clasp, but easier to use after printed - it is rotated sideways so that the portion that clasps the actual smooth rod is as smooth as possible.  The bridging necessary on the normal version can lead to sub-par performance grasping the Y smooth rod, or a lot of clean up of the printed part.  With this sideways version of the clasp, the part of the print that clamps against the Y smooth rod it comes out much cleaner (and if you have any bridging imperfections, they occur in the screw holes, which have threaded metal screws reaming through them, rather than where the smooth rods go).\r\n\r\nI use 4 of these per MendelMax 1.5 printer in conjunction with the Parametric Y Mount - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:60400."
