function: "I have been playing around with personalizing items by adding relief shaped text with the 'WRITE' plugin, on top of them.  \nNow I have a better procedure: I print the text in a one layer hight and after a filament change, I print the object that has before been boolean differenced with the same text block.  \nThis is a speedlimit sign with 3 colors :-)  \n\n-  \nPlease 'LIKE' before collecting!  \nThomas"
