function = "A short, simple, public domain, OpenSCAD script to make raised numbers so you can add serial numbers, version numbers, phone numbers etc. to your objects.  It allows digits, dashes, periods, and spaces.  It uses 7 segments like an old calculator (except the 1 is centered).  \r\n\r\nI'm using this in the Rhombot to print the assembly instructions on the pieces themselves. For all 43 parts, two parts connect if they have the same number printed on them.   It's quite a jigsaw puzzle without the numbers."
