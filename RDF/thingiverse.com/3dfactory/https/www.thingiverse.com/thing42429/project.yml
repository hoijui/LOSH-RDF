function: "I sell Mendelmax kits on eBay and looked everywhere for the perfect hardware organizer to include with my Mechanical kits. I couldn't find anything. Then I realized I can just create my own.  \n\nYou can get these tackle boxs at Dicks Sporting Goods. The divider will let you get at least double the amount of compartments."
