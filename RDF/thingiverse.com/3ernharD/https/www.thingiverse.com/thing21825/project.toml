Currently i am generating more trash than useful things.\r\n\r\nIf home 3D printing goes big it is essential that we can recycle old plastic things.\r\n\r\nThe technology has an unbelievable potential and this great open source community makes it possible that we are all part of this revolution !\r\n\r\nGo on printers !"
