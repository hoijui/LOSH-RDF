function: "Not a derivative at all. richgain gets all the credit for the model. This is just a new approach to 3D Printed sculptures.\r\n\r\nThingiverse user richgain applied a hole in his sculpture. I just added a LED and printed the sculpture with translucend PLA.\r\n\r\nThe result is really nice and I think it can be easily applied to other sculptures as well."
