\r
This is my first addition to the Thingiverse and the first time I've ever used Openscad. So please let me know if there is any mistakes made, either in the code or the upload in general. \r
\r
It's supposed to be a basic customizable gear, that can be used in any situation as a replacement gear. I wanted to give the user complete control over the different parameters to successfully be able to mimic their old gear. It may not be a involute gear, but it should suffice in most cases and therefore be a very USEFUL thing.  \r
\r
Anyhow, it's been fun to make, and it's always fun to learn some new things. I'm usually a 3dsmax/vray/inventor man but I'am a sucker for everything open source.""" ;
