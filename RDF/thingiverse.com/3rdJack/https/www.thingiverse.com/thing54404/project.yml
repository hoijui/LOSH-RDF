function: "Hello there, \r\n\r\nI'm new to Thingiverse and just started using Openscad, I started out doing a Customizable Gear as my first project and this will be my second project. \r\n\r\nThis is supposed to be a scale model of an old 5 cylindrical, radial engine. It's basically me trying to reproduce a complete Inventor model in Openscad, just for fun. I'm a sucker for anything opensource and wanted to see what could be done. There are of course plenty of detail lost, but I still find it pretty amazing what the program can do. \r\n\r\nAnyhow, leave a comment and let me know what you think =)"
