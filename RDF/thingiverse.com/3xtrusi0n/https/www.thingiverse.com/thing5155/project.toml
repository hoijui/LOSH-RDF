function = "I've been noticing a lot lately that the unicorn pen plotters are getting more and more popluar everyday so I went out and hacked my ABP to allow for fully automated unicorn pen plotting. Basically to give you a summary to how it works. I wrapped paper around both of the axels on the ABP and the motor pulls the paper off of the rear axel like a scroll to a new section of paper to print on. Simple yet very innovative.
