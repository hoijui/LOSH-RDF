    okh:function """Okay, so I'm pretty sure a lot of you saw Cooch's PNEMAtruder. This extruder is nearly the same except for a few changes (not really a derivative because it's a completely new design). This time around it runs off of a NEMA 23 stepper that gives out 76 oz-in. (5.47 kg-cm I believe) which is just enough to throw the filament down into your hot-end. This system still uses the plunger idea from the MK5 (because it's just that epic (props to charles pax)), as well as the MK5 mounting chassis, although I will be uploading the MK4 version/Printruder II (maybe III?) version for those who do not have the MK5. Comment on this thing if you want me to upload the MK4 version or printruder II version.\r

 Only sad part about this is that I had this stepper customized for this operation by Anaheim Automation. Data sheet is up for download if anyone cares to see. (Plus I ordered it 1-4-2011 so it'll be here by saturday (1-8-2011))\r
