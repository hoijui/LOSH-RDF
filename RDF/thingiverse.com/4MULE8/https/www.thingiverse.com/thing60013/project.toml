function = "Cubimals (portmanteau of \"cube\" and \"animals\") were an in-game collectible from Glitch. The game has shut down, but the former players continue to love Glitch memorabilia. This is a working version of the frog cubimal, which will spin the propeller when the key is turned.\r\n\r\nYoutube video of some sweet propeller action! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYvDjvXh2CA\r\n\r\nInformation about the collectible in Glitch - http://www.glitch.com/items/collectibles/cubimal-frog/"
