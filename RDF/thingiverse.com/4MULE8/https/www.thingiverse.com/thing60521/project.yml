function: "In the words of AuntDaisy, \"Comura looks fun!\"\r\n\r\nIf you built a home made 3D printer you're probably already a nerd, but if not then printing a moveable model trilobite will definitely earn you some nerd points! (Nerds are sexy these days, right?)\r\n\r\nI spotted AuntDaisy's excellent \"Trilobite Articulatum\" design http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28259 about a week ago, and immediately thought about the other wacky and excellent trilobite fossils. Without having finished reading the description I was already looking at google images of Comura, then came back re-read the description and realised we'd had the same idea!"
