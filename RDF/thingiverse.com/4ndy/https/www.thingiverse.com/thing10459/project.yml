function: "More of a test and showcase of an idea than any fancy new design; it doesn't get much simpler than this.\r\nPlease go ahead and make larger sizes too. :)\r\n\r\nUntil sensible packaging that's biodegradable or easy to recycle becomes more widespread, in a pinch you can fill out any gaps around packages you have for postage with these little cylinders.\r\nOn output, they seem to be reasonably stiff, easily springing 1mm or so in diameter with a strong squeeze, and breakable at a few millimetres. They could be used to replace expanded polystyrene 'packing peanuts', whereever scrunched-up paper is too squishy.\r\nIt might be a good idea to cut a small amount of the material out of the model to reduce stiffness even more.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder included is 15mm long, with an ideal Inner Diameter of 9.5mm and OD 10mm, the resulting effect being that a 0.5mm extruder nozzle will draw a circle one-line-wide on each layer, which should shrink to be a loose fit around M8 bar/studding.\r\n\r\nThis gives the part three simple purposes:\r\n1. Biodegradable packaging\r\n2. Circular print test/calibration\r\n3. Spacers and/or protective sleeves for M8 fastenings"
