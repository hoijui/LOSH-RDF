function = "I got some sheets of sandpaper 230mmx280mm (a little wider and shorter than A4) and wanted a handy holder to turn strips of it into sanding blocks to make jobs easier. This is what I came up with.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to grip sheets of sandpaper cut to 40mm wide by just over 200mm long, but with the files included it should be easy to re-design to your needs."
