function = "This is a derivative of the Folding Wood Booklet, a great implementation of living hinges in wood.\r\n\r\nI redrew the design and made it into a box, suitable for trinkets, cards, photos, small papers.\r\n\r\nThe hinge is quite durable, but not ineducable. I don't feel like I would wear it out with frequent use. It's also surprisingly flexible for being made of wood. \r\n\r\nI plan on using more living hinges in wood from now on."
