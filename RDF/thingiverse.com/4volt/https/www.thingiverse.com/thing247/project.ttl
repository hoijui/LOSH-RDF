    okh:function """I created this design while learning how to use my laser, it's a good simple project that creates 35, 1.2in hex pieces that you can build abstract sculptures with. They make a great desk toy or gift with a custom engraving on the peices. I'll be giving several sets out this Christmas.\r
\r
This pattern creates about 35 pieces, and the only material you'll need is a 8x8in 1/8th (200x200x2mm) piece of plexiglas. \r
\r
This plastic was marked as 1/8th inch, but was only 2mm (between 1/8th and 1/16th) I've been able to find this regularly find at my local home improvement store for $1.50. \r
\r
35 pieces is enough to build a 6 inch sphere, or some other large abstract object. If you want to stretch them, 7 chips is a good minimum.\r
\r
This toy is not intended for young children, the edges are mildly sharp and could possibly be a choked on.\r
\r
I originally drew this in flash, and am including that as well as a DXF.""" ;
