One could put the thing in a envelope or a small plastic bag, but all of those like a distinct "giftiness", they don't really look like a gift.\r
\r
Enter the Folded Box, it's small enough to print and/or cut from a piece of standard size card stock. You can also easily customize it with a logo or name to make it that much cooler.\r
\r
The box is cut from a single sheet of material. Thick paper, card stock and poster board work well. This pattern will not work well with corrugated cardboard since the thickness of it will make the folds difficult to make.\r

\r
The 7x8 pattern produces a final box that is about: 2.5 x 2.5 x 1 inches inside.\r
The 8x8 pattern produces a final box that is about: 3.5 x 2.5 x 1 inches inside.\r
