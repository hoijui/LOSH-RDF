function: "It seems that many of my things I'll be giving as Christmas presents this year are small, less then a few inches in dimensions. That brings up the question, How do I pack it? One could put the thing in a envelope or a small plastic bag, but all of those like a distinct \"giftiness\", they don't really look like a gift.\r\n\r\nEnter the Folded Box, it's small enough to print and/or cut from a piece of standard size card stock. You can also easily customize it with a logo or name to make it that much cooler.\r\n\r\nThe box is cut from a single sheet of material. Thick paper, card stock and poster board work well. This pattern will not work well with corrugated cardboard since the thickness of it will make the folds difficult to make.\r\n\r\nThere are two sizes:\r\n\r\nThe 7x8 pattern produces a final box that is about: 2.5 x 2.5 x 1 inches inside.\r\nThe 8x8 pattern produces a final box that is about: 3.5 x 2.5 x 1 inches inside.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in more of my stuff check out: http://4volt.com"
