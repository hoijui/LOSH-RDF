    okh:function """This business card is a tri-folded laser cut card meant to look like a old school cassette tape.\r
\r
The advantage this card has over other is that there's a zipper seal (like on UPS envelopes) on the back of the card that lets you open it like a tri-fold brochure so you can fit a mini-portfolio or a bunch of text on your usually too small business card.\r
\r
This design gives you about 3.5 x 4in of space that you can't see when the card is folded and sealed.\r
\r
It's possible to print the card on standard thickness paper, or card stock, though printing and folding normal paper turns out to be the the most similar to a standard business card in thickness.\r
\r
