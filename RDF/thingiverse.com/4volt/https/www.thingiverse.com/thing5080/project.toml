If was a fun project, easy to execute.\r\n\r\nSo Iâ€™m releasing the files out into the wild, I hope that you all make bit more and maybe buy a little less. \r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll notice there done in the retro pixel 8-bit style, everyone seems to like them.\r\n\r\nVisit my blog post: \r\nhttp://4volt.com/Blog/archive/2010/12/09/space-invader-christmas-ornaments.aspx\r\n\r\nIf you do not have a laser cutter you can also donate and get a set in a nice gift envelope:\r\nhttp://4volt.com/Buy/SpaceInvader.aspx"
