function = "With the recent release of Portal 2 and a birthday of a friend of mine, I wanted to do a portal themed laser something to give him.\r\n\r\nWhat I came up with is this, a small flag you can put in your cupcakes or other baked goods. Yes, I know cake does not make a appearance in Portal 2, but it is still my favorite Portal reference and is well known.\r\n\r\nI made mine with white acrylic, which is easy to clean and is durable enough to reuse several times.\r\n\r\nSo, cut your self some flags and declare your cake a lie.*\r\n\r\nThis item is also in my Ponoko Showroom (http://www.ponoko.com/showroom/4volt), so you can buy a set today!\r\n\r\n*The above statement may or may not be a lie."
