    okh:function """With the recent release of Portal 2 and a birthday of a friend of mine, I wanted to do a portal themed laser something to give him.\r
\r
What I came up with is this, a small flag you can put in your cupcakes or other baked goods. Yes, I know cake does not make a appearance in Portal 2, but it is still my favorite Portal reference and is well known.\r
\r
I made mine with white acrylic, which is easy to clean and is durable enough to reuse several times.\r
\r
So, cut your self some flags and declare your cake a lie.*\r
\r
This item is also in my Ponoko Showroom (http://www.ponoko.com/showroom/4volt), so you can buy a set today!\r
\r
*The above statement may or may not be a lie.""" ;
