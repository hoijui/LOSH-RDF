function = "Derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7022\r\n\r\nWhen I printed out the original, everything worked OK (re-using the axis cap and all) but I was 3mm off somehow.\r\nDidn't feel like messing around with the STL so I made it again in openscad.\r\n\r\nThe bolts are also a bit short, since they are supporting both this and the cap, but if you don't file down/drill out the holes more, they seem to actually support the bolts pretty well. If it comes off or starts to, I might change the design to have a countersink (I hope that's what it's called) for the nut to sit in - or you can just use longer bolts."
