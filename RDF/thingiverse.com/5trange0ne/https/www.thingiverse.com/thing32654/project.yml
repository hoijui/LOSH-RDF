function: "The MendelMax Y-axis was in need of a redesign. The original design with two plates of aluminum was too unstable and difficult to level. So I came up with a new set of rod holders and a bushing holder / belt clamp combo piece.\r\n\r\nThe rod holders are split and rest wider than standard. The bushing holders allow the Y-axis motor to be moved to one side. The power supply and electronics can then be arranged underneath the bed without needing feet to extend the height of the MendelMax.\r\n\r\nThe real advantage is that the bed is centered and leveled by virtue of both designs. \r\n\r\nThanks to Spacexula for testing out everything and for all his feedback."
