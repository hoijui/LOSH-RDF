function = "I created a parametric box script in OpenSCAD to make some custom storage boxes.  My 11 year-old son asked if I could make him a box to hold a deck of Pokemon cards.  He requested it have a Poke Ball on the front of the box and on the lid.  I am anticipating he will be asking for more of these.\r\n\r\nI included the OpenSCAD script.  It is parametric and has the ability to create a box and lid in any size with dividers (in both X and Y).  It can also round the corners as desired.  The Poke Ball decorations can be easily removed and/or replaced with anything you desire.  Enjoy!"
