function = "I needed a replacement drawer for my small parts organizer and looked around thingiverse for a starting point.  I liked the drawers attached to the Small Parts Cabinet thing so I ginned up a parametric OpenSCAD script to create something similar.  Almost everything about the script is adjustable.  The included stl is a standard drawer with three compartments made to fit a store-bought organizer."
