    okh:function "After playing with both the Heart Gears http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6291 and Gear Gears http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6533, a good friend wanted something different.  She liked the way the Heart Gears moved and is totally into solar power, so she asked if I could make gears that looked like a sun.  Believe it or not, I am very new at this and had very little experience with OpenSCAD.  I understood that if I could get an stl file of a sun it should be relatively straightforward.  Unfortunately, I could not find a good one.  However, I did find the Geek Campfire thing by jonschwartz http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:578, and thought it would look pretty cool if I put several of them around a squashed sphere.  Voila!  I made her one in translucent blue PLA (at her request) and now you can make one too.  The image of the one I printed is an earlier revision (hence the flat ends of the two tallest gears), but I fixed that in this release.  I have included an stl of the complete assembly, but only so you can see what it looks like." ;
