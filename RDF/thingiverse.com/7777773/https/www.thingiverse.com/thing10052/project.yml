function: "After a visit to the Museum of Science & Industry (in which a disproportionate amount of the trip was spent in their Space Center) I felt like making my own little contribution to thingiverse's Space Month with a little Space Ship One model.  \r\n\r\nI had plans of mashing this up with http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8754 to make an actual flying SS1 model, but since I am not a rocket surgeon, I leave that to someone with more experience."
