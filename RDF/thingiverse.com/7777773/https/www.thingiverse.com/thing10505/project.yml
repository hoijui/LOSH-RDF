function: "Quick & simple STL Translation of the Protoceratops point cloud, made by copying the process outlined at this uoregon tutorial:\r\n http://lcni.uoregon.edu/~mark/Projects/Brain_casting/Point_cloud_to_mesh.html\r\n\r\nI followed all of the defaults & made no changes in Meshlab beyond there.  Then it was run through Netfabb to fix the file, but it is still a long way from printing.\r\n\r\nIf anyone with more experience in point cloud to mesh wants to add their input, I'd love to hear it.  This was my first try at making an STL from photo data and the photo-to-3D concept looks amazing."
