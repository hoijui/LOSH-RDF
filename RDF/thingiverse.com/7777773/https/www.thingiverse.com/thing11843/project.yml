function: "Here's your opportunity to print your own robotic drug dealer toy.  \r\nRobocop 2 wasn't the best sequel, but I always thought the Robo Cain design was pretty cool.  \r\nhttp://goo.gl/qN2t5\r\n\r\nThis is definitely still a work on progress, and many details were removed by Netfabb when I tried to fix the mesh for printing.  I'm still re-working the mesh and will be posting it as individual pieces for assembly after print."
