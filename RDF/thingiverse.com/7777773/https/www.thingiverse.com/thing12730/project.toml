function = "The Star Fury space fighter from Babylon 5.\r\nOne of my favorite SciFi ships, ever.  Star Furies look like they could actually function as a real space craft.  The ship is basically a set of engines and reaction control thrusters mounted as far from center as possible, with an upright pilot (the better to handle high-G acceleration) and a bunch of guns in the middle.  \r\n\r\nhttp://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/SA-23E_Mitchell-Hyundyne_Starfury"
