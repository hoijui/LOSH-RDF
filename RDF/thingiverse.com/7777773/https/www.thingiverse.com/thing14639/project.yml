function: "Greetings Starfighter! You have [once again, but this time in higher detail] been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan armada. Get ready! Prepare for blast-off.\r\n\r\nThis is an Hi Poly version of the Gunstar from The Last Starfighter, which I guess makes the previous model a beta unit.... And that brings us to Lesson Number Two... You've got a good thing going here. Keep smiling, don't blow it."
