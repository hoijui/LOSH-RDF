function = "I guess you could say I'm a bit of a lockpick hobbyist, and everyone that has ever met me will tell you I'm in to 3D printing, so I naturally enjoy it when these two fields overlap.  \nI've carried Ray's Dutch police handcuff key on my keychain for several years as an example of 3D-printed technology (See http://blackbag.nl/?p=940 and thing 5420 linked to the right), so when I saw that he'd done it again and posted the file for the Chubb key to Thingiverse I was naturally enthused.  \n(See http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/07/16/hacker-opens-high-security-handcuffs-with-3d-printed-and-laser-cut-keys/ and Thing 28480 in this Thing's ancestry).  \n\nHowever, Ray chose not to post a copy of the Bonowi style key; just the Chubb (also linked at right) so I figured this was an opportunity to have a go at recreating some 'verboten' keys.  \n\nThis is my version of Ray's Bonowi style high security handcuff key.  It is reverse-engineered from photographs and has not been tested.  It's pretty likely that I do not have 100% accurate dimensions, and that as a functional key this is a failure, but I had plenty of fun making this and it was a nice opportunity to try out Tinkercad."
