function = "This is the third revision of Stonehenge on the Thingiverse, which makes it  part of a trilogy I'm working on in natural PLA which is the saddest of all plastics, I find. People weep instantly when they see it, and I don't know why.\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/8bsI8k9L7RD\r\nI'm loving the tinkercad import feature.  I've intended on adding a base to this model for at least a year but never find the time.  Thanks to the magic of web modeling I was able to do this in less than a minute over lunch today."
