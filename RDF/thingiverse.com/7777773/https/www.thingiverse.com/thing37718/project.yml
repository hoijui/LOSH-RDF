function: "We all know the the story of Cory Doctorow...   Decked out in red cape and goggles, he watches over us from his balloon fortress somewhere in the blogosphere, just above the tag clouds.\r\n\r\nWhat many of you may not know is exactly what he protects us from.  You see, Cory Doctorow has an evil twin from the Mirror Universe, the evil DR.ow EVIL, commander of MAFIAA army...  a ruthless terrorist organization determined to suppress all innovation.  Behind every DMCA takedown, lurking in the space between SOPA revisions, whispering into the ears of every corrupt politician... DR.ow EVIL is there."
