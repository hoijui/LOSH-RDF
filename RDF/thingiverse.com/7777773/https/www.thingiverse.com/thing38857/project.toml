function = "Same as the earlier Cyberman, but poseable.\r\n\r\nI've been working on making printable moving parts since before I ever posted my first submission to Thingiverse, and I'm still terrible at it.  I'm pretty sure this is the first submission I've made public that actually has any moving parts, and it's not perfect.  If you have any suggestions or critique, please don't hesitate to share...  My goal is to eventually get a reliably reproducible open source template to build custom printed action figures with 80's-era GI Joe action figure levels of articulation."
