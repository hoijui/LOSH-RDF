function = "The ED-209 Enforcement Droid.  \r\nPrecursor to the Robocop series, these bots were a failed line of police droids released by the Omni Consumer Products corp.\r\n\r\nAdapted from a model found on Google's 3D Warehouse\r\nhttp://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=407f587a61961dee3f217b945a063dd2&prevstart=0\r\nProcess: export the STL from Sketchup (it only gives me DAE as a valid filetype, but that works) then convert the DAE to STL in Meshlab, and then fix the file in Netfabb.  \r\nThis works for direct conversions; if you want to edit the file in 3DSMAX or Maya, output to Obj in Meshlab and you should be able to open the Obj anywhere."
