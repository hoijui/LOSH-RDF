    okh:function """_09th Dec 2018: Ok, I just realized, that I uploaded this sometime in 2010 but never pushed the publish button (probably out of shame). I'm catching up on that now, so you can marvel at this abomination_\r
\r
##**Description**\r
\r
This is a make-shift filament spool for the BfB RepMan 3d-printer made out of a ClubMate bottle, a threaded rod, a couple of nuts, washers, duck tape and cardboard. With minor changes/enough tape it can probably attach to other printers as well.\r
\r
##**Assembly**\r
\r
The pictures are pretty self explanatory, i guess.\r
\r
As you can see, originally the rod was attached to the printer with duck tape. If you are willing to suffer a inconsistent-style-penalty, you can print the spoolclip.stl twice and screw these clips onto the lower half of the threaded rod with reasonable space in between them.\r
\r
To complete the holy trifecta of makeshift consumables you can add some WD-40 to the washer or maybe the nut at the tip of the rod, but this is not necessary to archive peek performance, which is barely acceptable btw.""" ;
