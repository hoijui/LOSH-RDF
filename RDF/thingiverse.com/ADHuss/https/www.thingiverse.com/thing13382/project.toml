function = "I created this for a friend that is rebuilding his old â€™93 Kawasaki Intruder 750cc for his wife.  Letâ€™s just say he had taken it apart far enough that he was dumb founded as to how he was going to take the last nut off so he could get the clutch cage off the transmission drive shaft.   Well I took a friction and a steel from the clutch pack and designed this tool for him.  It uses the clutch housing to lock the clutch cage in place and gives him an access hole to get a socket on the nut holding the cage to the transmission drive shaft."
