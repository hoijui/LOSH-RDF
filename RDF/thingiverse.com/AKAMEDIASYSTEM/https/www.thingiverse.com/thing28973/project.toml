function = "This is a bracket that perches on a 3/4-inch plywood board and holds two NEMA 17 stepper motors side by side.\r\n\r\nI designed this for use on a drawbot I'm building - I decided to center the motors to simplify wiring. I'll just place two pulleys at the top edges of the plywood where the motors would normally go.\r\n\r\nThe shape is optimized for printing on a Makerbot Replicator."
