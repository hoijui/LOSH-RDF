function = "This mount gives you a few ways to securely connect boards, shields, and peripherals. Prints fast!\r\n\r\nThe shape is simple and easy to modify in Sketchup. I made this to attach a Sharp IR sensor to an arduino+ethernet shield stack. \r\n\r\nThe holes are 1/8 inch diameter, and I've been gently tapping each hole with a machine screw before installation...no problems so far!"
