function = "The rumors are true.  Stephen Colbert's head has gotten very big ;-)...so big that I hollowed it out and you can wear it.  That's right, this is your very own wearable Stephen Colbert head so you to can be Stephen Colbert. No I'm not going Silence of the Lambs on y'all, it's printed in nylon.  Its a tight fit in my large frame laser sintering machine...the material alone would cost thousands of dollars, but I want to build one so bad in one piece!  Ah ha, maybe I can finance the building of it by gathering donations on Kickstarter?  I have set up a build with 700 1/12 scale versions that will fit around the full scale head and be the reward for donating!"
