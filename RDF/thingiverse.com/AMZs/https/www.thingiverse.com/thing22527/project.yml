function: "A simple, printable pan/tilt assembly. It needs two servo motors (I've used HITEC HS-422, so the servo bracket fits that). Also, an attachment is provided to be able to couple the 'contraption' to a tripod with an RC2 (Manfrotto) plate. \r\n\r\nSee the photo how to put it together. \r\n\r\nIf anybody needs to know, that is a Devantech TPA81 thermal sensor array on the top...\r\n\r\nIf you are really interested, you can check the pan/tilt head out at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amzsaki.com/?page_id=343"
