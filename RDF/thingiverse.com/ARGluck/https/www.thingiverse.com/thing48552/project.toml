function = "A simple tool holder that sits in the back left corner of your Rep2. It holds my caliper and all 4 hex wrenches that come with the Rep2. I would have made one to sit on the outside of the \"windows\" but my caliper is too tall. \r\n\r\nI will eventually make a \"window\" tool holder to hold my feeler gauge, brush, and other assorted tools I use regularly on my Rep2."
