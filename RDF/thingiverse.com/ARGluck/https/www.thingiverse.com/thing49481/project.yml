function: "As the name states, a simple stackable battery holder. Right now it's just AA batteries but I'll scale and upload others if people want them. The top (and bottom) has a little beveled edge to make it easier to place batteries and trays.\r\n\r\nThe things I design I try to make use as little plastic as possible and I think this does a fair job of it.\r\n\r\nI made this because at work I'm always left with a hundred barely used AA batteries from my students robots and I got sick of the random piles and cardboard boxes."
