function = "A heart pendant I designed for my wife. It started as the basis for a heart puzzle but evolved into this. Spent way too long figuring out different ways to do it but here it is just in time for Valentines day!\r\n\r\nUpdated 2/16/13 as I realized I had uploaded an older STL. This one prints the ring much easier as it's slightly larger and better positioned."
