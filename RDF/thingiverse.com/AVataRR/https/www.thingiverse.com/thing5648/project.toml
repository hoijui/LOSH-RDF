function = "After destroying several plastic belts in silly experiments, I needed a cheaper and quicker way of sourcing replacements. There's nothing cheaper and quicker than making your own with kapton tape and paper! I think it works even better than the plastic belts because of better adhesion and less surface warping. Works with the Cupcake's ABP V1.0 and on the Thing-O-Matic's ABP (although you quickly get wrinkles in the middle because of the roller gap)"
