function = "This is a Matlab script to convert a surface (technically a function of two variables) into a solid that can be printed. \r\n\r\nI wanted a way to visualize (in solid 3D) mathematical functions, and this gives you a way of converting from a mathematical description, directly to a solid.\r\n\r\nI haven't uploaded the scripts here, because they are already at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30709-surf2solidMatlab file central and keeping them up to date at one point seemed more sensible."
