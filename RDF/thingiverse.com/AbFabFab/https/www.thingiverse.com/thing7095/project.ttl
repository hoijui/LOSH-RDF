    okh:function """This is recreation of a Roman ballista. Its small (obviously), and isn't an exact replica (Romans didn't work in plastic). Its about the right size to fire a pencil.\r
\r
It should be fairly obvious how it works, but I have some instructions below, and a short movie.\r
\r
P.S. I am aware of the Thingiverse policy not to publish "weapons". I see this as a toy -- it can fire a pencil about two feet with considerably less force than I can throw it. However, please be careful as points can always put out eyes. Also I know someone could potentially beef this up until it fires knives at a 100 miles and hour. Please don't.\r
\r
TODO: this is a work in progress because there's some things I want to add.\r
-- a mounting point so you can put it on a "table" (a stand on a pedestal).\r
-- a ratchet, winch and trigger mechanism, that are vaguely period""" ;
