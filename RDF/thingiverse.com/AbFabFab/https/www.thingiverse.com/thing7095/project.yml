function: "This is recreation of a Roman ballista. Its small (obviously), and isn't an exact replica (Romans didn't work in plastic). Its about the right size to fire a pencil.\r\n\r\nIt should be fairly obvious how it works, but I have some instructions below, and a short movie.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am aware of the Thingiverse policy not to publish \"weapons\". I see this as a toy -- it can fire a pencil about two feet with considerably less force than I can throw it. However, please be careful as points can always put out eyes. Also I know someone could potentially beef this up until it fires knives at a 100 miles and hour. Please don't.\r\n\r\nTODO: this is a work in progress because there's some things I want to add.\r\n-- a mounting point so you can put it on a \"table\" (a stand on a pedestal).\r\n-- a ratchet, winch and trigger mechanism, that are vaguely period"
