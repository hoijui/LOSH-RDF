function = "You want to connect a filament spool to your Prusa Mendel? \r\nThe filament spool will balance on two treaded rods.\r\n\r\nThis mount is a bit shaky, but so far durable. \r\nToo much load might cause damage. So use it at your own risk.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nThe lower structure is not stable enough. At 37Â°C room temperature and a weight of 2 kg the arms bended. The spool mount broke. \r\nPlease upgrade to the new fortified spool mount. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29142 \r\n Or use far less weight."
