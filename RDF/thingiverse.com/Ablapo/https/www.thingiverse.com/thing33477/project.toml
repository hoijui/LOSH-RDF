function = "This tablet stand looks like a teethed Monster. Print it in orange for a Halloween feeling!  \n\"This Monster Tablet Stand will bite every IPad it can reach\". So use it at your own risk.  \n1. Tablet_Stand_Ablapo.scad - with edges  \nThanks to xtreme712 and his iPad Stand version. I changed some dimensions and cut holes into it.   \n2. T_S_Halloween.stl  \nFirst I used Meshlab for Remeshing. Then I used Topmod for cutting the edges and smoothing. Finally the tablet stand monster was created - the Halloween Edition."
