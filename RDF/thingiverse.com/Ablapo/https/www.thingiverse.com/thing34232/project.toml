function = "Just in case you want to rotate something using your hand, you could use this hand grip with bearings ...\r\n\r\nI am using a M5 rod. But you should be able to use another size up to M8 by changing the scad files. \r\n\r\nTo build a crank you will need 2 additional shaft couplings and 2 more threaded rods. But now it is about the hand grip.\r\n\r\nWell, ball bearings are overkill? Just set the size of your favorite big washer in stead of the bearing's size in the Openscad file."
