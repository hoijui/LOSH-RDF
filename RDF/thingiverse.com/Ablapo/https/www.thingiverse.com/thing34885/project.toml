function = "It's a counter weight (~66g) fixed on a M6 threaded rod. \r\n\r\nYou can choose not to close the bottom with a washer and nut to use it as a foot thing.\r\n\r\nThe M6 washer with a diameter of 19.6 mm fits very nice on top of the M20 nut.\r\n\r\nThe printed part will ensure to fix the counter weight centered on the rod. The washers hide the printed part.\r\n\r\nThe screw is derived from marcaxi."
