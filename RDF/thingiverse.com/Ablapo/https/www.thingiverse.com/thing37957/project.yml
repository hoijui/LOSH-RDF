function: "This is a modified version of Jonas Kuehling's \"Y Carriage Mounting Frame for Slim LM8UU Holders\". It  includes two mounting tools: snap_on.stl and rod_end.stl.  \n\nThe idea is to have a maximum distance of the smooth rods by printing two connected LM8UU holders diagonal on the print bed. You can make a larger print bed for your next new 3D printer with this diagonal technique.  \n\nThis technique causes a poor alignment of the two holder pairs. But the additional mounting tools will help there.  \n\nIf the smooth rods are not parallel, a rod fixation clamp can break apart after a while and bearings may fail sooner.  \n\nUpdate:  \nAdded a new modification of the LM8UU holder. The enforced side walls reduce the risk of breaking. You should be able to adapt the nuttraps to you needs."
