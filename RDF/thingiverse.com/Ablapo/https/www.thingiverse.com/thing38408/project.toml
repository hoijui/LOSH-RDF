function = "It's a mobile phone holder with couplings in xyz directions. (Couplings: Z = M5 bolt, Y= M3 bolts, X = M5 bolts)\r\n\r\nThis one is sized for my I Phone Four S. To resize it for your smart phones, try to change the OpenSCAD parameters. \r\n\r\nWith this holder you will have many ways to mount your cell phone everywhere you like. But remember, there are many ways to damage your cell phone, too. \r\n\r\nUpdate V3:\r\nAdded a x-coupling with a plug connection. With that you can attach a vertical rod on each side. The thumb wheel is for a fast assembly and disassembling of the x-coupling."
