function = "Of late I've been getting 2kg 300 metre 3mm rolls of PLA (from Lybina in Bayswater). No reel holder would come close to holding a reel so wide so i made my own. This is a variation of Humberto's reel except I extended the reel length, added support along the internal length for extra strength, changed the angle so that it now angles up instead of down so that the reel doesn't touch your machine and hamper rotation, re-enforced the base where most of the weight from the heavy spool is centered, increased length of bottom external support so that some of the stress was off the top prongs, increased size of reel end so that the reel can't fall off. This is my third variation and the first that worked a treat."
