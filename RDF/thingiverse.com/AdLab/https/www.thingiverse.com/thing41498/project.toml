function = "The Cateye Velo 5 and 8 are nice cheap and small bicycle computers that have a big button sticking out the front. If you hold down the button for a few seconds it resets most of the data on the unit. \r\n\r\nIt's far too easy for stuff to accidently press the button and erase your ride data when the computer is in a bag or pocket. That's why I made this little laser cut glue-on part on that makes it harder for random objects to press the button. It doesn't get in the way when the computer is on the bike.\r\n\r\nDXF now uploaded, as promised."
