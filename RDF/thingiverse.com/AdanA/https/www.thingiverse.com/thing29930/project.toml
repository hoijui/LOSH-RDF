Once sealed it becomes a (relatively) child-safe object that will open these magnetic child-safe cabinet locks:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Magnetic-Locking-Complete/dp/B004GCJMLG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347039672&sr=8-1&keywords=magnetic+cabinet+locks\r\n\r\nThis solves the problem of losing the key that comes with the locks, having a key that is a color that displeases you, or of paying too much for the replacement/extra key:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Magnetic-Locking-System/dp/B004FI7USI/ref=pd_bxgy_ba_text_y\r\n\r\nNote that you may be able to use one large magnet rather than a stack of four. I just had a ton of that kind of magnet on hand."
