function = "An evolution of emmett's razor blade handle. \r\n\r\nExcellent for removing prints from the build platform.\r\n\r\n-tweaked the fit to work with the single-edged razor blades I'm most familiar with (Stanley #9?). Key to a forgiving fit was the full cutaway under the corners. \r\n\r\n-added unnecessary but fun flourishes like radii and chamfers"
