function = "This was the first in what I intended to be a string of iterations. As with many parts that assume that position, it falls short of my hopes. BUT: it works. \r\n\r\nA team of four of these will clip a 3.3mm sheet of glass to the aluminum HBP of a Replicator 1 acceptably well.\r\n\r\nI hope to have my next iteration, when it comes to exist, include a pair of embedded binder clip arms. I'll use the Pause at ZPos function. In the meantime, this works.\r\n\r\nThus it suffers the curse of adequacy: it's not good enough for me to be pleased with it, but it's not bad enough to immediately need replacement. I figured I'd post it and maybe someone else will take it out of its misery."
