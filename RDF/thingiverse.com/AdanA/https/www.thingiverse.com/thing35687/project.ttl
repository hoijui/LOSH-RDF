A team of four of these will clip a 3.3mm sheet of glass to the aluminum HBP of a Replicator 1 acceptably well.\r
\r
I hope to have my next iteration, when it comes to exist, include a pair of embedded binder clip arms. I'll use the Pause at ZPos function. In the meantime, this works.\r
\r
Thus it suffers the curse of adequacy: it's not good enough for me to be pleased with it, but it's not bad enough to immediately need replacement. I figured I'd post it and maybe someone else will take it out of its misery.""" ;
