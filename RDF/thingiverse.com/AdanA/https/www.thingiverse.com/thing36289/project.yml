function: "To add to the many existing Soma Cube models on Thingiverse. I actually first modeled this long before learning of Thingiverse or acquiring a 3D printer. I made some out of wood, which is great. But it's fun in plastic too.\r\n\r\nThe feature this has that others on Thingiverse (so far, I think?) don't is that each little cubelet is chamfered. This helps make it less obvious, at a glance, where one piece ends and the next begins.\r\n\r\nOne of the other models (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11644) linked to this Parker Brothers manual scan, which is awesome: http://www.fam-bundgaard.dk/SOMA/NPARKER/NPARKER.HTM"
