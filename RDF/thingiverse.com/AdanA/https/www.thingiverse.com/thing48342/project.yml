function: "Nothing super special, just a nice little bin.\r\n \r\nI have grander ambitions to make these in various complementary sizes and shapes, add divider features, make a toolbox system that works with them, etc. While I get around to doing any of those things, however, this is a nice busykeeper for when I'm not quite ready for the printer to print something else."
