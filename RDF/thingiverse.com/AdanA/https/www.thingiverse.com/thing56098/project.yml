function: "Don't you hate it when your miniature airplane collection gets crushed in your pocket? Me too! That's why I protect mine with this handy dandy little matchbox thingy. \r\n\r\nThe airplanes are from http://www.instructables.com/id/Mini-Staple-Sailplane/, one of the greatest Instructables I've seen. They're so much fun to play with.\r\n\r\nFor some discussion of the process, here's a blog post I wrote about using the thing: http://www.makersite.com/blog/2013/2/26/success-tiny-plane-carrier\r\n\r\nThe version posted here has some empty space to allow you to vary the plane design somewhat. The .pdf attached, if printed 1:1 on 8.5x11\" paper, will at least give you the basic outline to use as the foundation of your creativities."
