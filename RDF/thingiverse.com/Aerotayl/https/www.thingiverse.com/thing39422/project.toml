function = "I wanted to make a set of stabilizers that sat outside by build area and also have them bolted instead of zip tied.\r\n\r\nThese stabilizer do require the rods to protrude atleast 15 mm from the outer nuts.\r\n\r\nOne downfall of moving them to the outside that I realized is that brace can interfere with x axis motor and not allow for maximum height.  I have removed the brace from that side and still use three braces."
