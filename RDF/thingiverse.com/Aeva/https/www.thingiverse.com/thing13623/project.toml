function = "The model in the .blend file is rigged, so you can pose the arms, head, and torso before printing.  Also, in a hidden layer, there's a copy of the mesh before applying the mirror modifier and assigning vertex groups, if you want to play around with the model's shape.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty pleased with how this experiment turned out.  Pleased, because I made a model, rigged it, posed it, and then printed it - and it mostly worked!"
