function = "A fancy lamp with room to add your own wiring to.\r\n\r\nImprovements since the prototype:\r\n1) Split up into four parts to allow for larger printing.  Assumes a max build height of 8.5-9ish cm.\r\n2) Base parts have threading so they just screw together.  Top part is now printed upside-down to give it a nicer exterior surface.\r\n3) Holes for wiring and adding switches."
