function: If your wife wants to mount her ipad on the wall by the treadmill to listen to Pandora, consider this 10-piece snap-together bracket/holder for an iPad with cover. It is meant to be wall mounted with two screws. The file here is not monogrammed like the one in the picture, in case your initials are not KLH. This is my first "thing" that I created from Sketchup to PrintrBot.
