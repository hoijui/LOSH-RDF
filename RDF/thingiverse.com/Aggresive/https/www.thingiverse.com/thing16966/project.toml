function = "This is a fan mount for my Orca 0.3 x-axis linear bearing mod. ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15418 )\r\n\r\nIt fits a 60mm fan, and should fit a 40mm fan, and blow cold air at the nozzle (cooling fan).\r\n\r\nI have found that my extruder struggles to reach 230 degrees now, so i'm thinking about designing a duct for this."
