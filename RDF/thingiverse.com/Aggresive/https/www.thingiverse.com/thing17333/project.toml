function = "These are upgrade files for the Orca 0.3 to change the z-axis to linear bearings.\r\n\r\nThe nut traps are slightly higher, due to the 1.25-ish millimetres difference between the ball bearings and linear bearings.\r\n\r\nThe nut trap files are for two different nuts, one standard, and one 24mm long.\r\n\r\nJust an FYI, the quality of the prints has increased dramatically since this mod; I no longer get shifts each layer. Each layer is 'almost' exactly the same position. (see pictures)\r\n\r\n*Have re-uploaded the linear bearing stl, as bolt holes slightly too small/close together. Also made clearance on linear bearings slacker."
