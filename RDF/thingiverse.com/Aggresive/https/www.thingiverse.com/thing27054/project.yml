function: "I have modified this to be printable without needing to drill the mounting holes/hobbed hole/idler hole.  \nIncluded parcan version.  \nThe new individual files are modified slightly, in that they require the 'bridged' holes to be drilled out, this gives a much nicer finish, (there are only 2 layers @ 0.25mm layer height) and results in a smoother face for the bearing. I find an 8.5mm drill bit works great for the hobbed bolt hole.  \nThe support tears away, as there is a gap of 1 layer between the support and the part. A pair of pliers removes these in one piece.  \nAlso, the holes have been widened slightly, to reduce how much drilling is required.  \nUpdated parcan and j-head mirrored versions.  \nUploaded Huxley Bowden mount and tounge, and 1/8\" BSP threaded mount.  \nUploaded a SLDPRT file of the j-head, made from scratch, using the original STL dimensions.  \n\nUPDATE 16/10/2014 - lowered the j-head mounting holes down, to match the dimensions on the j=head wiki."
