function = "Similar to dynai's version.  \n\nThis doesn't need scaling, and holds the bearings nice and tight.  \n\nUpdated the part (13-05-13) to make it more rugged, it also allows for pre-loading of the bearings to take up slack. Just apply pressure to the housing (forcing the shaft to the edge of the bearing) while tightening."
