function = "Have just recently changed to an orca 0.43, which uses 1lb reels and a plastic guide tube. This means that the filament is easiest to feed from below the printer, as opposed to most which feed from above the printer.\r\n\r\nThis meant that the printer kept twisting the filament off of my old spool holding device.\r\n\r\nI also had an old 5.5lb reel from reprapcentral lying about.\r\n\r\nInspiration struck, and I thought of this.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any other spooler like this on thingiverse, as I looked before trying to re-invent. :)\r\n\r\nThis is for a 95mm wide spool, however this will only effect the guides, and could just be printed shorter.\r\n\r\nThe top piece remains mostly stationary as it guides the filament. The bottom piece rotates to unreel the filament.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Gap bracket.stl attaches to the top piece, and stops the filament from being able to work into the gap between the two pieces. Bolt these as close to the vertical wall of the spool holder as possible, but leave a 1-2mm gap, so that the parts can still rotate freely."
