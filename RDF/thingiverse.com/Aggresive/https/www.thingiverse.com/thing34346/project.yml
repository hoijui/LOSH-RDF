function: "This is modified to move the drive gear 0.6mm further away from the filament path than the original.  \n\nThis should allow a much straighter filament path, similar to 1.75mm setup. The original caused the filament to bow around the drive gear.  \n\nThe best solution would be to make the mounting bolts slots, so that the distance can be changed for the hot-end in use.  \n\nUPDATE: I've added a hole for a 3mm allen key, for easier large gear removal, and increased the depth of the inlet on the top piece."
