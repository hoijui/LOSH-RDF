function = "My printer is upstairs, so the vibration from the printer travels downstairs. To combat this (completely removed the issue) I designed and trialled these.  \n\nThis will work with a prusa etc, but you'll have to make/design your own mounting piece.  \n\nUPDATE: The housings are now a tighter fit to the spring (should still be loose though). and the spring has been increased in pitch.  \n\nUPDATE: PLA springs probably aren't the way to go, they lose their springiness over time, and would need to be reprinted.  \n\nThinking some of the problem could be that the orca weighs so much and is almost maxing out the spring with just it's weight. I've uploaded a taller, heavier duty spring that I'll try at some point.  \n\nUPDATE: feet_spring2,stl is my current spring. These have done literally hundreds of hours of printing with no noticeable change. However, they don't do such a good job as the original ones, due to being more rigid."
