function = "I really like Greg Frost's most recent x-carriage but I had a couple ideas that I thought might make it more accessible.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1) Added back the other two pairs of mounting holes found on the Prusa sled.\r\n2) Moved the belt clamps in so as to not block the zip-tie slots.\r\n3) Added a bit more width to the belt clamp slots to accommodate slightly wider belts.\r\n4) Made the M3 hole in the tensioning stud a bit tighter & deeper."
