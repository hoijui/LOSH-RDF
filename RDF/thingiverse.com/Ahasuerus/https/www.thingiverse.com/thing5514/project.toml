function = "An attempt to decrease the plastic volume and part count to the Huxley as well as simplify assembly.  I am making everything M3 & 1/4\" but it should work with M6 as well.\r\n\r\nThis project is mostly abandoned -- don't have the time to properly complete it.\r\n\r\nCurrent build status:\r\nMostly assembled, but trying out x-axis alternatives.  Will update parts as I revise my build.\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n- assemble extruder\r\n- compare x-axis alternatives\r\n\r\nMy parts:\r\n2-way bar-clamp x8\r\nbelt-clamp x4\r\nbutterfly-motor-coupling x4\r\ncarriage x1\r\npulley x2\r\nvertex/leveling-vertex x4\r\nx-motor x1\r\nx-idler x1\r\ny-bushing-holder x4\r\ny-motor x1\r\nz-motor-vertex x2\r\n\r\nRusty parts:\r\nboard-clamp x4\r\nbushings x12\r\n\r\nPart descriptions:\r\nbelt-clamp\r\n- changed dimensions\r\n- changing holes and traps to M3 (currently a little tight)\r\n \r\nbutterfly-motor-coupling *new*\r\n- coupling for z axis motors and threaded rods based on Rob's Auto-centering shaft coupler (http://reprap.org/wiki/Auto-centering_shaft_coupler)\r\n\r\ncarriage\r\n- thickened fan mount area of carriage\r\n- changing holes and traps to M3 (currently a little tight)\r\n\r\npulley\r\n- modified nut-trap, created hole to slide in assembled screw + nut \r\n\r\nvertex *new*\r\n- simplified vertex\r\n\r\nx-motor\r\n- nut traps changed to M3 with hole to slide in assembled screw + nut \r\n- threaded rod traps changed to 1/4\"-20\r\n- reduced height & size (3 hole motor mounting)\r\n\r\nx-idler\r\n- nut traps changed to M3 with hole to slide in assembled screw + nut \r\n- threaded rod traps changed to 1/4\"-20\r\n- reduced height\r\n\r\ny-bushing-holder\r\n- removed wings, added nut trap to center\r\n(trap currently a little tight)\r\n\r\ny-motor\r\n- reduced height & size (3 hole motor mounting)\r\n\r\nz-motor-vertex\r\n- combined z-top-motor with vertex\r\n- thickened bar mounting clip\r\n(need to beef up underside by smooth rods, make other minor tweaks)\r\n\r\nOptional/alternative parts:\r\nleveling-vertex *new*\r\n- use instead of normal vertexes\r\n- insert M3 nut & M3x8 screw for leveling\r\n\r\nM3 rosette thumb screw *new*\r\n- fits onto head of M3 bolt"
