The files are uploaded for anybody who wants to make changes to the extruder, to make it fit their own printer for example.  \n\nFor a performance improvement, consider changing the brass gear insert for the MK7 Drive Gear.  \n\nVisit http://airtripper.com/?p=367 for full build details.  \n\nUpdate: STL file has been added for the extruder idler with flange added.  \nTo improve printing reliability a flange has been added to the idler to help resist warping and becoming loose on the build platform. The flange easily snaps off when printing is done.  \n\n*********** Update 25/7/12 **********  \nA new OpenSCAD source and STL file has been added to better fit the MK7 Drive Gear (aitripper-extruder-v2.scad, aitripper-extruder-v2.stl).  \nThis should reduce the amount of hacking if any to make the wider gear fit. Some adjustments was also made to the filament guides to allow the filament to flex around the gear more easily to reduce friction.  \nI don't have the MK7 Drive Gear to test the results due to the high cost the supplier charges for shipping the part but I'm confident the changes are close enough to work."
