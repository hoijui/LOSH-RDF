function = "A few things annoyed me when I built a new Extruder, so this project started to be just a few fixes but then I ended up fixing a lot of small issues.\r\n\r\nThis is just one more in a long line of extruders derived one from the other. I named it AJGW to reflect contributors in the main line, but I did add all interesting accessories like the heringbone gears and fast release lever.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the new features:\r\n\r\n*) new concept split filament guide, fixes better and allows easier access.\r\n*) Idler hinge doesn't touch the gear anymore.\r\n*) option (default) to use 5/32\" screw for the idler which is easy to find\r\n*) longer oblong hole for the motor screws. This eliminates the need to remove the motor when testing or adjusting the heringbone gears.\r\n*) Top access to screws with ball end allen wrench. This allows for much easier attaching and removing, specially when there is a fan duct. Optional without nut fitting in base.\r\n*) Heringbone gears a little thiner and nicer looking. Better fit of the screw\r\n*) Open access to the insides for cleaning and inspection, just like Greg's\r\n*) Redesigned Fast Release Lever but keeping the same concept\r\n*) reinforcement to the upper idler screw attaching point, this was a frequent point of breakage\r\n*) reinforcement behind the tractor screw's bearing, to avoid frequent breakage\r\n*) reinforcement on the top with a little extra height\r\n*) Idler printing sideways, this avoids weakness in the hinge screw\r\n*) thicker motor mounting base so that M3x10 screws can be used without extra spacers\r\n*) Various external support structures, prints better without automatic support and it is easy to clean.\r\n*) Parametric, various simplified optins including 1.75 filament\r\n*) Many small things that you will not even notice that they aren't there anymore to annoy you...\r\n\r\nAll metric screws, except for the long idler screws that are not available as metric.\r\n\r\nA few extras are included, like washers that you can print instead of going out to buy them.\r\n\r\nIt was originaly thought to be used for 0.25mm layers, but it has been tested by some friends with 0.4mm too.\r\n\r\nI am releasing a few options that make sense to me and to some friends. If you need a different option and are having trouble with the .scad files, please post a comment and I will be glad to include other options.\r\n\r\n2013/feb/17: there is an adapter for the Prusa i3 here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29795 please let me know if it works!\r\n\r\n2013/mar/17: I found another nice support here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:57668\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1: small reinforcement in the Idler, included STL files for both 4mm and 3/32\" (very usefull only in Brazil)"
