function = "Replacement bracket for the z axis nut holder in a Printrbot Jr. \r\nReduces the amount of play the z axis nut had to a minimum. \r\nReplaces the original threaded rod and nut with stainless steel M8 threaded rod, \r\ntwo nuts and a spring in between the two nuts. Ideally you should use brass nuts. \r\nBut I used stainless steel nuts since they were available and work just fine."
