function = "In Mendel and Prusa belt Y-axis is carried out through two bearings 608. \r\nUnder the strap is a lot of empty space, which can be used to increase the movement on the axis Z. \r\nI tried to hold the belt as the axis X. \r\nThis made the bearing bracket. \r\nI used the factory pulley 10XL037RSB ( SKF). For the plastic pulley to another carrier (axle bearing to move down a bit.) \r\nPros: a bearing 608, an increase in movement along the Z axis"
