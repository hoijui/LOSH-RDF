function: "I made this a few months ago, but hadn't gotten around to posting it.  Now that I'm using it, it seemed like a good time.\r\n\r\nThis is an adapter to mount a Canon EF compatible camera to an old Nikon lab microscope.\r\n\r\nIt is based on my EF Mount I designed a while back: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10829\r\n\r\nPicture descriptions: \r\n\r\nThe adapter itself, the microscope the adapter was made for, a few photos of pigment splotches on a professionally printed post card, and a single bottom-layer trace of black PLA, after it was extruded directly onto a microscope slide.."
