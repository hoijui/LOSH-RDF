function: "This is a cheap (~$25) table dolly for shooting DSLR video.  It is made from a canabalized $20 K-Mart skateboard, a few nuts and bolts, and printed parts.\r\n\r\nThe dolly rolls smoothly, and can go straight, at an angle, or in arcs or circles.  It is very easy to adjust, or to tighten down.\r\n\r\nAlso, yes, this could be made cheaper by making the trucks printed too so it just needs some wheels and bearings, but the goal with this one was to get up and running quickly.  The skateboard and other parts were bought, files designed, drafts printed, and the unit assembled and tested all in one evening, the evening before a presentation about special purpose and home-made camera supports for video."
