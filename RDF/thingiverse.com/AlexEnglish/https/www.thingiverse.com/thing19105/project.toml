function = "These lids were inspired by, and designed based on measurements from lids like these: http://www.amazon.com/36010-Mason-Canning-Plastic-Storage/dp/B001ASXI8 .  There is a regular mouth and a wide mouth version, these should fit any standard canning jars.\r\n\r\nIf printed well, and well tightened, these lids are almost water tight (actually, they form a tighter seal than the commercially sold counterparts linked above), but not air tight.  These are suitable for use in storing dry goods, non-food small parts, etc., for storing opened canned goods in the refrigerator, and probably for use in the freezer.\r\n\r\nThe main shape of the lid is deliberately low-poly so it is easy to grip and apply a good bit of torque with bare hands.\r\n\r\nThese were printed with ProtoParadigm's green PLA on a Makergear Mosaic.\r\n\r\nAdditional accessories will be released that use this lid as the base."
