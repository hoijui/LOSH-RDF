function = "This is a strainer lid for canning/mason jars, available for both regular and wide mouth.\r\n\r\nInspiration came from this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10601 and a desire to strain the liquid off of canned peaches.  Useful for any canned goods, or anything else you need to strain from a jar (like kefir grains, or vanilla beans when making an extract, etc.).\r\n\r\nSee http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19105 for the lid this was based on, and for links to more canning jar accessories."
