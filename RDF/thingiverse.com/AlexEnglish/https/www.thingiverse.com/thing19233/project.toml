function = "This mount was made to attach Radio Shack fan 273-240 to the fan on the Mosaic extruder for cooling.  This fan is very similar (has the same dimensions as) the Mosaic extruder fan.\r\n\r\nI had an unfortunate accident with the cooling fan that came with the Mosaic, and this was the only workable replacement available at my local Radio Shack, so here's what I used to mount it.\r\n\r\nThis was derived from this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13764 , adjusted for the smaller fan dimension, and extended to hold the fan a little lower (since it's not as tall)."
