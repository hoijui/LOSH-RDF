\r
I had an unfortunate accident with the cooling fan that came with the Mosaic, and this was the only workable replacement available at my local Radio Shack, so here's what I used to mount it.\r
\r
This was derived from this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13764 , adjusted for the smaller fan dimension, and extended to hold the fan a little lower (since it's not as tall).""" ;
