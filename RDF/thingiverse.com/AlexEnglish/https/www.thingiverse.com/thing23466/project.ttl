    okh:function """This is a manual spacing tool for sowing seeds at different spacings in a hexagonal pattern.\r
\r
This pattern has many benefits, including higher density of crop grown per square foot, the plants themselves do a better job of choking out weeds, the tighter foliage shades the ground which keeps it cooler and moister, requiring less watering.\r
\r
Here you can see how the spacing works in the complex case of companion planting multiple things together, but it also applies to the simpler case of a single crop, for which these tools were designed: http://organic.kysu.edu/CompanionSpacing.shtml\r
\r
For more information about the method, and a natural, holistic gardening method, check out this book: How to Grow More Vegetables by John Jeavons - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U6KIPA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=engfamfar-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001U6KIPA \r

In the photos, you can see a top-down view of a patch of radishes planted with this sort of spacing (2 inch), and a couple of radishes just harvested from that patch.  You can see how dense, but evenly spaced the plants are (save for one here and there that didn't come up).""" ;
