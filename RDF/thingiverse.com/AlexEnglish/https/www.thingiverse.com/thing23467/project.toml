function = "This is a slug trap for killing slugs in the garden.  Print, fill about 2/3 the way full with beer (probably any kind), put the lid on, and place in the garden.\r\n\r\nSlugs will be out more when it's raining or has recently rained; the lid helps the water run off so the rain won't dilute the beer and make the trap ineffective."
