function: "Use this to make radish, clover, bean, and other healthy, tasty sprouts.\r\n\r\nWhile I had the idea back when I made my original canning jar lid and started working on accessories, the Germinator Cover by konato is what motivated me to find a good way to print it without relying on infill settings.\r\n\r\nI had shelved the project for a while because I hadn't had time to implement a screen like I wanted, but then came along the fine mesh screen by Wauter.  Wauter did a great job of something I had only gotten half-working."
