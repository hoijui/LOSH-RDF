function: "This is not meant to be printed directly, but rather used as a library to incorporate the Burning Man logo into openSCAD designs.  See the LogoDemo module in the file for an example of how the logo can be incorporated into a surface.\r\n\r\nThis could be made much better, I would gladly welcome a derivative thing from someone with superior artistic and/or openSCAD ability."
