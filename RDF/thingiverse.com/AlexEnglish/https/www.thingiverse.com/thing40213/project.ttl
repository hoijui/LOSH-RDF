\r
This should work for many small microcontroller development boards.\r
\r
These dimensions are intended to fit a SimpleCortex board, which is the board I needed to mount.  It provides a solid, but easy snap-fit, while preserving access for all on-board IO connectors, etc.\r
\r
A number of features can be turned on and off, including tapered screw holes in the bottom, a finger hole in the bottom (useful for helping to push the board out if you want to remove it), and outside tabs to screw through, or tabs to sew across for mounting on fabric.\r
\r
The version pictured is the one with the sew tabs, as that's what I needed at the moment.""" ;
