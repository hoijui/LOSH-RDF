\r
I made this a long time ago, but finally figured I'd put it up in case it could be useful to someone else.\r
\r
These could be useful in the closet of a motor home or trailer, or maybe for organization in a home closet.\r
\r
I made this to help feed plastic to my printer.  In my basement home-office, I have a closet rod hung up between rafters on which I hang my filament to feed to the printer below.  These clips go between the spools to keep them from sliding around or rubbing against each other and creating friction.""" ;
