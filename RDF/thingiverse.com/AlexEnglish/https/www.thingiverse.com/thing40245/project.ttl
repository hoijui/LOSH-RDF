\r
It's really simple and thrown together and I welcome more functional or feature-rich derivatives or patches that improve upon this.\r
\r
UPDATE:  I updated the file, commenting out the module call at the bottom.  I hadn't actually included this in a project yet and hadn't remembered that was still turned on.  Now it works properly as a module without having to modify the file.""" ;
