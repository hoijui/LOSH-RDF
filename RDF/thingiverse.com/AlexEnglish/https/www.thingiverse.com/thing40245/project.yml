function: "I needed a wedge shape in openSCAD.  There is no native functionality for a wedge, and I was surprised to see that none existed as a module.  I figured I'd release what I came up with.\r\n\r\nIt's really simple and thrown together and I welcome more functional or feature-rich derivatives or patches that improve upon this.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  I updated the file, commenting out the module call at the bottom.  I hadn't actually included this in a project yet and hadn't remembered that was still turned on.  Now it works properly as a module without having to modify the file."
