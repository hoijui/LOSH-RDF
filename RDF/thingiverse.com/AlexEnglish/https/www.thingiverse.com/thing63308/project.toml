function = "This is a sifter / shaker lid for canning/mason jars, available for both regular and wide mouth.\r\n\r\nI saw one of these made out of stamped metal at a gift shop and wanted to recreate it. Useful for shaking flour, cornmeal, or other powders.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19105 for the lid this was based on, and for links to more canning jar accessories.\r\n\r\nI made this a long time ago and it sat here as a draft Thing for some time, I'm not sure why I hadn't pushed it out."
