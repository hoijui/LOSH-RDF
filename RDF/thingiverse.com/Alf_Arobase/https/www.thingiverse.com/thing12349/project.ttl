His size is as close as i could from the real size, however don't hesitate to measure it by yourself.  
(the stl file come from a solidwork 2009 file .sldprt, so i might not be optimised for this format, ask me if you want the SW file)  

The aim of this model is to help you in creating a wire dispenser or some similar stuff. But it's too big to be printed by a reprap, scalling it could be an alternative to get a small roll dispenser (but still not optimized for 3D printing).""" ;
