function: "Here is a roll use as a dispenser for PLA or ABS wire. it's barely common, my model came from the shop grrf.de .   \nHis size is as close as i could from the real size, however don't hesitate to measure it by yourself.  \n(the stl file come from a solidwork 2009 file .sldprt, so i might not be optimised for this format, ask me if you want the SW file)  \n\nThe aim of this model is to help you in creating a wire dispenser or some similar stuff. But it's too big to be printed by a reprap, scalling it could be an alternative to get a small roll dispenser (but still not optimized for 3D printing)."
