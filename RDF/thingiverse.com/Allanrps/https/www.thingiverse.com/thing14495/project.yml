function: "This is an untested alto saxophone mouthpiece based roughly off a beginner Yamaha mouthpiece but it does not resemble it much. The similarities include bore length, facing width, and basic length measurements. I was surprised with it's intonation and ease of playing, which were better than the model mouthpiece. \r\n\r\nTip Opening: 0.080\r\nFacing: 18mm from tip\r\nBore: Square"
