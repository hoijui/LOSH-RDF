    okh:function "So one of my tenants has a full sized Ford pickup, with the center console option. Somehow, he managed to lose one of the cupholders from the console. After being told how much the replacement part would cost him at the dealership (Somewhat north of $50!!), he asked me about it as he was aware I have a ToM. About 30-40 minutes of time in Sketchup, and another 90 minutes to print one out at 0.25mm resolution, he is happy as a clam! So if anyone out there also needs to replace their cupholder, well, here you go!" ;
