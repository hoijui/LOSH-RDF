I recently acquired a power winch for my pickup truck, as it is a receiver mount style, it will only be mounted there while in use. I will use it at either end of my truck, therefore I will have one of these power sockets on each bumper. The covers will keep crap out of them, ensuring they will be reliable when needed the most." ;
