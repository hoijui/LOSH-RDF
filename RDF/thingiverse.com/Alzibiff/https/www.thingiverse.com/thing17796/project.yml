function: The Balsa ply bracket on my RRP Huxley started to split over one of the horizontal threaded rods which led me to the git hub repo to find the DXF file which I imported into SCAD and extruded to 6.5mm which is what I measured as the depth on the wooden piece. This was before I found Rhys-Jones' file here! My version differs in that it carries the RepRap Pro logo rather than the EMaker logo - that's about it!
