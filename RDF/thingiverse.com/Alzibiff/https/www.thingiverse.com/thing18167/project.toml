function = "I spend ages looking for the 'right' filament spool - I am using Fabedashery filament on a RepRapPro Huxley. Eventually I came up with a hybrid consisting of Smartroad's adjustable hooks http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16357 , Randyy's Parametric Filament Spool Mk2: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8317 and finally Watsdesign's vertical holder. The holder has a spindle support based on Randyy's design amended to enable it to be fixed to the vertical support."
