function: "Following on from Bad Brad's Gear O'Clock (amazing) and VeryWetPaint's accessories (brilliant), I have produced two plates - one for the odd numbers and one for the even numbers - dimensions still in inches. There are another couple of files here too which I hope will help people with home build reprap machines - I am using a RepRapPro Huxley. In order to slice the open top mechanism housing and the main drive gear from VeryWetPaint using Slic3r and Skeinforge I found that I had to rotate them through 180 degrees in the Z direction before I could get a print - the files here are the ones from VeryWetPain but rotated as above.  \n\nBearing in mind that I am working in mm and that that PrintTo3D and VeryWetPaint are working in inches, I used the scale option in Slic3r for my two clocks. The first clock, which I wanted to mount on my desk divider at work was scaled at x20 and I used a scale of x25 for my other one - this is the maximum size for my RepRapPro Huxley - the ClockBaseDiv4 STL from VeryWetPaint is excellent and just about fits on my print bed at x25.  I amended VeryWetPaint's slotted drive gear as I purchased a clock movement with circular push fit type shafts. (Here in the UK, the only movement I could find with a slotted minute shaft was VERY expensive and so I used movements from www.ClockParts.co.uk - a lot cheaper!). The file here, (which has a drive gear scaled at x20 from the original) has a 3.6mm hole which pushes on to the minute shaft: no need to remove the hour shaft. This part has a 26mm diameter face and takes the second hand gear scaled at full size.  \n\nAt first, I started printing numbers using a single colour, intending to paint them but after reading Stephen Cropp's very well documented technique for splitting GCode in order to print multicolours, decided to become a purist and make my clock 100% plastic, no paint! http://stephen.cropp.co.uk/category/3d-printing/"
