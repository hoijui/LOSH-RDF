function: "With 2012 being the year of the London Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, the Union Jack seemed an appropriate project to try out some multicoloured printing on my RepRapPro - single extruder - Huxley.\r\nRichRap's British Prusa Mendel, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12905 , was my inspiration for producing this thing, the idea being that it could be scaled as needed and stuck onto other things.\r\nThe design was produced with a piece of graph paper, an image downloaded from the internet and my somewhat distant memory of being taught at Cubs that the Union Jack is made up of three flags: the white diagonal cross on a blue background of St. Andrew (Scotland), the red diagonal cross on a white background of St. Patrick (Ireland) and the vertical red cross on a white background of St. George (England). The object is made up of three parts: a white base colour on top of which is a blue colour topped off with red.\r\nThe Union Jack by the way should always be displayed, hung, flown the correct way up (as shown in the photograph) as it is not symmetrical - those in the know should never fly it upside down!\r\n\r\nEdit: My dad pointed out that the red St. Patrick cross is not as it should be. The two red stripes which form each of the diagonals should be offset and not continuous lines as I have drawn. Ho humm - thank you daddy!"
