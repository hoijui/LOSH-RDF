    okh:function """The RepRapPro Huxley which I built almost a year ago came via the Indiegogo campaign which I believe followed the eMaker campaign for the first generation of this design in the summer of 2011. Since then, I noticed on the Wiki that the Y-carriage had been turned upside down. This is a great design improvement in my view as it provides a more stable support for the heated bed - less chance of 'wiggle' and less chance of the bearing holders breaking as a result of brute force and ignorance when removing printed parts.\r
When you turn over the Y-carriage bearing holders though, the nyloc nuts at the bottom are no longer captured  - there is no hex hole to stop them rotating and tightening them can be a wee bit fiddly  once the bed has been levelled as you need to use a spanner whilst holding the levelling screws still which is a shame after the time spent carefully getting the bed level - tightening the nylocs in this way can upset all the hard work!\r
The only change which I have made to the Y-carriage bearing holders is to place a hex recess  to hold the nyloc nuts which take the levelling screws. You level the bed as normal but then only have one nut to tighten up to keep things tight - the one just below the spring.""" ;
