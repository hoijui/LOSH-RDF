function: The Blinking Christmas tree was one of the first prints on my new Mendel90 machine, assembled from a kit of parts from Nophead - and it turned out VERY well indeed. However, I thought that I would make a change to the base so that it could accommodate a power supply connector. I also decided against building up the multivibrator circuits and took the easy route by purchasing flashing LEDs.
