function: I found that there were problems with the original files when it came to the sleigh (without Lego bumps) and also with the connector piece. Now fixed by Chefmaki. However, that was after I had tried to make this thing - what you see here is how things ended up. My daughter helped decorate the reindeer and sleigh and also came up with the idea of a number plate (licence plate) for the sleigh.
