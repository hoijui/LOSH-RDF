function: I was asked to make some replacement Connect4 tokens for someone who had lost three of each colour. No problem I thought. Silly me - the real life tokens have 24 holes and 24 blips on them which enable one token to stack onto another. However, it was a good CAD exercise and although producing them requires a printer capable of some very fine detail, the ones shown here worked just like the originals.
