    okh:function """Derived from Thing 33338, this version makes fitting the Lightning cable a little simpler although permanent. The size of the dock trough has been changed to accept an iPhone 5 in a rubber type case - mine retails with the name "Belkin". It will also accept the iPhone 5 without a case.  
Thanks go to Okatake who designed the original and gave me the assistance I needed in order to make changes to his SCAD code. (Read the comments in his Thing for more details).  

EDIT 17th November 2013  
Uploaded a variant which uses an M3 grub screw to grip the Lightning connector, (iPhone5Dock_AlzibiffV6). I made this several months ago. You will need a 12mm M3 grub screw and an M3 nut - careful not to squash the lightning connector too much!""" ;
