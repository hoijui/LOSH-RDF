function: "This is a part to attach your safety cutoff in your 3D Printer next to the rainbow bridge  in the Z axis.\r\nI will add pictures later in order to show you where you have to place it.\r\nYou can print the part in two different parts without support or in one part adding supports in skeinforge with Raft enabled but with Cross Hatch disabled ( too hard to remove the supports with Cross Hatch)"
