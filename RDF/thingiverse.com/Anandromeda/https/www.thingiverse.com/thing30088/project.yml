function: "The \"AT-AS\" (All Terrain - Anita Scout) is a printable quadruped robot. \r\n\r\nThe AT-AS is a project of an efficient robot, as it has achieved a useful and complete walking robot base using few technical and economic resources. In addition, it is a flexible robot project since its design is open to many development possibilities in future works such as the transformation of the quadruped model to a hexapod model, easy modification of leg and modular structure design, the possibility of adding sensors to improve control or communication with other robots using wireless networks via Xbee modules. \r\n\r\n\r\nI used two parts of the \"Versatile Servo Bracket System\" created by bryanandaimee: \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5784\r\nBut the rest of parts has been designed by my own, using OpenSCAD and C++ OOML (Oriented-Object Mechanical Library): http://iearobotics.com/oomlwiki/doku.php?id=start\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the AT-AS implementation, I used:\r\n\r\n- 1x Arduino Mega 2560.\r\n- 8x Servo Futaba S3003.\r\n- 1x Lipo Battery (2S, 7,4V).\r\n- 1x UBEC (5V).\r\n- Remote control through a Gamepad connected to a PC. \r\n- Wireless communication through Bluetooth or XBee modules.\r\n\r\nBut this robot accepts others microcontrollers, servos (with similar dimensions) and others components for its control. Use the one you prefer!\r\n\r\n\r\nSee a video of AT-AS quadruped in action:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae2UiOCUZeY&feature=g-upl\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION: \r\nQuadruped Robot --> Hexapod Robot\r\n----------------------------------\r\nThe part called: \"hip_evolution_hexapod\" is only for the transformation of the quadruped model to a hexapod model. Using this part, just need to print another two legs! :)"
