As long as you brought your trusty Makerbot Survival 3d Printer you can now print forks! to eat your delicious fresh caught quail. Mmm mmm good!!!!\r\n\r\nThis fork was designed for the creating a fork when you find yourself low on plastic forks... Also handy for telling people that you made a fork!!!\r\n\r\n(I Dont own a 3d printer yet so I cant tell you how this will hold when eating things and I am not sure if ABS is safe to use to eat [Probably is since its used for water transport] but if you find yourself low on forks her is a DIGITAL one!!!)"
