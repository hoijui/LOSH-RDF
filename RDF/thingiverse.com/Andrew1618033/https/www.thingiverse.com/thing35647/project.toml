function = "This is a derivative of scooter46290's 'propeller for quadmini', intended for a miniature quadcopter. However, I've adapted some of the dimensions and hole sizes, and added a set-screw whole to accomodate both my preferred (and widely available) motors at http://www.pololu.com/catalog/category/60\", and a powered glider design I'm working on."
