function = "This is a curved dice, made with Mathematica and modified with Tinkercad. It is an octahedron, and is created with the equation sin(x) + sin(y) + sin(z) = 0. This was made by both myself and a friend. The dice was made with Mathematica, and the numbers with Tinkercad. I've made it hollow, so that printing many copies doesn't cost too much."
