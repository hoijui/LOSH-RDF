function: "Make adjusting your RepRapPro Huxley Z stop easier and more accurate. This simple bracket holds an M3 screw that allows you to use a screwdriver to make easy and accurate adjustments to the Z stop height.\r\n\r\nDesinged to be used with RepRapPro Huxley but could easily be used with other machines. The screw bracket is simply glued onto the X idler.\r\n\r\nThe z-endstop-holder_modified is a modified version of the Endstop holder by Josef Prusa. It is a modified version of the one contained in the RepRapPro Huxley STL files. The OpenSCAD file can be used to make further modifications to suit."
