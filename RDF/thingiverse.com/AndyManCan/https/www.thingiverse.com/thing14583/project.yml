function: "This is a model I did for an illustration I that I created called \"Opticon\" (\xC2\xA92011 Andy Lackow) that you can see on my web site: http://www.andylackow.com (only I think I changed out the eye for an earth globe). It is a somewhat detailed model that has highly detailed textures. The STL version I uploaded obviously has no textures. It's kind of a steam-punk combination of human anatomy and machine. I hope to do more complex models and illustrations in this theme some day. In the meantime I'm love to see this thing brought to life on someone's 3D printer!"
