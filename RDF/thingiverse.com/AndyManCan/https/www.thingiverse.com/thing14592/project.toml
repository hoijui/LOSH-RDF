function = "3D model of a household robot modeled in 3ds max for a magazine article illustration about electronics for the home of the future. You can see the full illustration on my web site: http://www.andylackow.com. Based on the iRobi made by the Korean company, Yujin Robotics. Here's a quote about the little guy, \"The iRobi is cute house and kid sitter robot. It can be remotely controlled via the web and has a surveillance camera. It can also tutor kids with his large integrated display. The eyes and mouth of the iRobi can show different moods.\"\r\n\r\nSounds like some syntax got a little lost in the translation."
