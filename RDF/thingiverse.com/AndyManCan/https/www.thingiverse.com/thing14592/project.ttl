You can see the full illustration on my web site: http://www.andylackow.com. Based on the iRobi made by the Korean company, Yujin Robotics. Here's a quote about the little guy, "The iRobi is cute house and kid sitter robot. It can be remotely controlled via the web and has a surveillance camera. It can also tutor kids with his large integrated display. The eyes and mouth of the iRobi can show different moods."\r
