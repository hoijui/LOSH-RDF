Mr Clicky is your desktop friend. Design and make him custom arms, legs and hats. :)\r
\r
He stands aprox 240mm high when assembled (he's BIG). If you want to print him you might need to play around with the file a little; he's very intricate (thin walls, hollow) and was designed for and made using SLS at shapeways. If you scale him down and do a print please show me! I'd love to see. \r
\r
If you must have your own Mr Clicky but can't print him, I'll be putting him on shapeways shortly. :)""" ;
