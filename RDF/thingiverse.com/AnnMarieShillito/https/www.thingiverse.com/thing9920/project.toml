function = "This is a more organically formed large petal for use with the rest of Bongoboy23's Blooming Flower parts http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9863 to replace his large petals. I downloaded the large petal form and manipulated it using Anarkik3D's haptic Cloud9 3D modelling software. With this package it is very easy to create more organic forms and I have also downloaded and made the central flower by tc_fea http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5883 more plant-like."
