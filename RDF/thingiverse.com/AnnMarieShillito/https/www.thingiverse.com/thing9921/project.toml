function = "This is a more organically formed, more plant-like central flower http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5883 (originally from tc_fea) for use with the rest of Bongoboy23's Blooming Flower parts http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9863 to replace the central flower. I downloaded this flower form and manipulated it using Anarkik3D's haptic Cloud9 3D modelling software to be less cookie-cutter-like. With Cloud9 it was very easy to create a more organic form using haptic feedback to push and pull the edges. I have also downloaded and made the large petal more organic too."
