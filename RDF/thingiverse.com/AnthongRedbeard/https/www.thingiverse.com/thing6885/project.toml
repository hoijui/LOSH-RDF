function = "UPDATED.\r\n\r\nAn option to replace the X carriage on Mendel RepRaps.\r\n\r\n*Variable length between bars.\r\n*Variable width for extruder mount, or other tools.\r\n*No more need for fitting things in the X carriage holes.\r\n*NO GLUE, but you can use glue instead of set screws if you like.\r\n*Hole for an LED to point down towards your print, and a channel to run the wire.\r\n*Less Plastic than anything I've seen so far.\r\n*More visibility where the extrder filament drive meets the hot end.\r\n\r\nPictures show the finished replacement installed and lit up. I have it connected to the blue toggle switch.\r\n\r\nAlso show the intermediary step of changing it out."
