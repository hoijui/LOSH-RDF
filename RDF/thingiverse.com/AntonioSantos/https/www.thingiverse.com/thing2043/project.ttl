\r
this is the first part I ever made on blender, actually I only modified it, but still hard to do for a noob on blender, like myself.\r
\r
IÂ´ve seen tbuser great design:\r
\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1579\r
\r
but I was not able to find the right size O-Rings in Brazil, so I decided to make a new version that would fit things that I had laying around the house.\r
\r
I used regular school eraser for the feet... they are soft enough to not let the vibration transfer to the table... which turn makerbot into a very quiet machine.""" ;
