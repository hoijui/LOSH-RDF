function: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nthis is the first part I ever made on blender, actually I only modified it, but still hard to do for a noob on blender, like myself.\r\n\r\nI\xC2\xB4ve seen tbuser great design:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1579\r\n\r\nbut I was not able to find the right size O-Rings in Brazil, so I decided to make a new version that would fit things that I had laying around the house.\r\n\r\nI used regular school eraser for the feet... they are soft enough to not let the vibration transfer to the table... which turn makerbot into a very quiet machine."
