\r
since I bought my heated build platform, I being forced to move from\r
my old trusty friend, the Skeinforge 006... and move to the newest one\r
with Raftless(so called v1.5)... I spent hours to get it to print like\r
the old version... and I finally got it to print ok... but not as\r
great as before... so I spent some time, and made the old 006 work\r
with raftless... and as soon as I did, I can tell that I am able to\r
print awesome parts again...\r
\r
I added a few new features to the raftless script also:\r
\r
1st - you can now tell skeinforge what is the temperature you want for\r
the raftless layer, and the next layers..\r
2nd - you can use it with raft script, in case you need support\r
features (tested, but needs work).\r
3rd - you can now tell the feedrate and flowrate for the remaining 1\r
layer, other then the first perimeter only...\r
\r
Let me know if you tested it...""" ;
