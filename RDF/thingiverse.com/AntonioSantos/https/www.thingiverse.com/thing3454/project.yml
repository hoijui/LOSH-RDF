function: "Hello all!\r\n\r\nsince I bought my heated build platform, I being forced to move from\r\nmy old trusty friend, the Skeinforge 006... and move to the newest one\r\nwith Raftless(so called v1.5)... I spent hours to get it to print like\r\nthe old version... and I finally got it to print ok... but not as\r\ngreat as before... so I spent some time, and made the old 006 work\r\nwith raftless... and as soon as I did, I can tell that I am able to\r\nprint awesome parts again...\r\n\r\nI added a few new features to the raftless script also:\r\n\r\n1st - you can now tell skeinforge what is the temperature you want for\r\nthe raftless layer, and the next layers..\r\n2nd - you can use it with raft script, in case you need support\r\nfeatures (tested, but needs work).\r\n3rd - you can now tell the feedrate and flowrate for the remaining 1\r\nlayer, other then the first perimeter only...\r\n\r\nLet me know if you tested it..."
