    okh:function """Quick and dirty mod for my ArduCopter Hexacopter. This is a prototype Y6 motor mount derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11604\r
\r
This is basically a dual motor mount with extra thick mount platforms. The Turnigy motors that I use have a very long shaft that quite simply need clearance. The extra thickness accounts for the added shaft length. \r
\r
Make use of the adapter plate X mounting hardware by using it to secure the motor to the mount. You should notice that the hole pattern was rotated 45 degrees to accommodate mounting motors on both sides. The original screw channels were removed as they were not necessary.""" ;
