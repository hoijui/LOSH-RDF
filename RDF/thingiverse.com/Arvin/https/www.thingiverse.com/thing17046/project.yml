function: "DEPRECATED: Brook has loaded a final assembly on the original Thingiverse site. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16990 \r\n\r\nThis is all the skp files that Brook Drumm uploaded. I have simply put them all in one file and arranged them how I think they go. Can't be exactly right till I get mine. I'm a backer of his Kickstarter project.\r\n\r\nThanks Brook!\r\n\r\nOne part is still not a skp file. It's easy to pick out. It's an stl and it's the front part in the image. Lots of lines show up."
