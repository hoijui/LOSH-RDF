Levine worked with MakerBot to create the sunglasses to be printed on the MakerBot Replicator, and models were wearing these unique fabrications during Levine's NYFW presentation. This collaboration marks the first time that a designer will be offering a piece from a collection to the public via an open-source download through Thingiverse.com.  \r
