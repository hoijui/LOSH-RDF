function: "Levine collaborated with MakerBot to create custom-made sunglasses for Levine's Fall/Winter 2012 collection which were presented at NY Fashion Week on February 10, 2012. Levine worked with MakerBot to create the sunglasses to be printed on the MakerBot Replicator, and models were wearing these unique fabrications during Levine's NYFW presentation. This collaboration marks the first time that a designer will be offering a piece from a collection to the public via an open-source download through Thingiverse.com.  \r\nWatch video of the 2012 Fall fashion show: http://vimeo.com/36623646  \r\nwww.asherlevine.com"
