function: "An articulated Trilobite to print and assemble.  (If you like Trilobites - have a look at 4MULE8's beautifully organic Comura Articulatum http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:60521 )\r\n\r\nUnlike the fossil ones you see in museums, you can have fun flexing and rolling this trilobite up - bit like a woodlouse (or pill bug.) It makes a satisfying clacking noise if you ripple the segments. \r\n\r\nYou can make baby trilobites by using just the smaller body sections. Whole trilobite families, or even armies, can be yours for the printing.\r\n\r\nThis creature is very inquisitive and can often be seen peering over people's monitors or shoulders.  \r\n\r\nJasonwebb has done a short video (with sound) showing it moving http://vimeo.com/47692125 and Busybotz has kindly included it in one of his excellent 3D printing videos www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGNg37Fc584 (starts at ~3:08) and http://3dprintblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/3d-printed-parts-assembled-and.html (starts at ~1:45).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about other designs of body (with spikes), head (more plate-like, and with more spines) and tail (spikes, and more spikes). Comura looks fun http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WLA_hmns_Trilobite_Comura_sp.jpg\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in trilobites, Richard Fortey's book \"Trilobite! - eyewitness to Evolution\" ( www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0006551386 ) is a great read; and I found http://www.trilobites.info/ fascinating, especially the eyes section http://www.trilobites.info/eyes.htm\r\n\r\nI've included a photo of the fossil trilobite that gave me the idea to make a stylised, flexible version."
