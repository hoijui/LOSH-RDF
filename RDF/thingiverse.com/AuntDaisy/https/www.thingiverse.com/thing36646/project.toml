function = "These are 3D printable templates for cutting (or drawing) the paper used to make Danish Hearts.   \nThere are 3, 4 & 5 strip templates and one wiggly one.  \nChildren love weaving them and the template allows you too cut lots of paper at once. (For more design's see  Lene and Anna Schepper's wonderful blog http://papermatrix.wordpress.com/hearts/ )  \n\nDanish history says that Hans Christian Anderson (of Ugly Duckling fame) created the first ones... and the traditional Danish colours are red & white (for the national flag); sheet music paper looks attractive with red paper.  \n\nThe templates make it easy to cut, with a sharp knife, lots of sheets of paper at once; or to mark out with a pencil for cutting with scissors.  \n\nYou can also do your own designs - Rosie (who's 9) did the centre one in \"DanishHearts2.jpg\".   \n\nI've included an OpenSCAD file to generate straight line Danish Hearts of any size and number of strips. Hopefully, new templates will follow..."
