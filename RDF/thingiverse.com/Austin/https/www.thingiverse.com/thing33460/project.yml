function: "I wanted to augment some Halloween treats we're giving out this year, so I dug up a cool bat model, cut the magnet-socket off its back and gave it a couple of handy hoops to thread a glowstick-bracelet through.\r\n\r\nThe source ancestor and OpenSCAD script are packaged together in a zip file (since the script references the bat model). While I hope the script is legible, it was written as a quick sketch."
