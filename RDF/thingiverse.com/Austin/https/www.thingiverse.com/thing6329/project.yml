function: "The original was great to have, but I made these tweaks:\r\n\r\n- The labels have been replaced with larger text generated using the Hershey Text extension. These labels should be now be super-legible, even on objects as small as ping pong balls. :D\r\n\r\n- After looking at Inkscape's y-axis orientation and the eggbot pen-motor orientations, the y-position labels have been vertically swapped.\r\n\r\n- The paths are now organized into layers named \"Grid Lines\", \"Direction Markers\", and \"Labels\". :)\r\n\r\nFuture changes: I intend to create some additional variants for heights of 950, 900, and 800. It might also be handy to have some regular-grid designs without labels to make it easier to pencil-sketch on a reusable ball and then transfer that design to Inkscape.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Silly me, I forgot to promote Hershey Text! Download it now!\r\nhttp://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/hershey"
