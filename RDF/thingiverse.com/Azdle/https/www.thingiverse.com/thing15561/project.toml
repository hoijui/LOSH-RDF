function = "Note: This dock will hold your phone, but it stands up a little too straight for my liking. When I get some time I'll fix it, but it'll be awhile.\r\n\r\nThis is a dock for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. I got tired of waiting for them to release an official one, so I decided to make one.\r\n\r\nThere are two versions of the file, each with a low poly version. The main file has a cutout in the bottom for a circuit board for interfacing with the the three contact points on the side of the phone. It also has two small resecess for rubber feet. The alternate version has a flat bottom for easy printing without support material.\r\n\r\nRubber Feet: http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/SJ-5508%20%28BLACK%29/SJ5508-0-ND/30796"
