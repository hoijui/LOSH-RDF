This is a dock for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. I got tired of waiting for them to release an official one, so I decided to make one.\r
\r
There are two versions of the file, each with a low poly version. The main file has a cutout in the bottom for a circuit board for interfacing with the the three contact points on the side of the phone. It also has two small resecess for rubber feet. The alternate version has a flat bottom for easy printing without support material.\r
