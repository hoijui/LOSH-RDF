    okh:function """This is just a simple mounting plate for the Tech Zone Remix Electronics that are being sold on the RepRap Forums. As these electronics are smaller, I felt it was a waste to use the full sized mounting plates. All the electronics mount on this one plate.\r
I have almost everything wired using this on my Mendel. This is not the final design. Also, there is still not yet a way to mount the Thermocouple board. That will be coming soon as a separate file.\r
\r
UPDATE:\r
Version 0.2 Changes:\r
*Cutout a section on the left that could have caused issues with the x-axis belt\r
*Added two a new pieces that hold the DC barrel jack and the USB->Serial board.\r
*Added horizontal adjustment to the top mounting point.\r
\r
Version 0.3 Changes:\r
*Fixed the USBBlock and its mounting plate.\r
\r
Note: I have now verified that the lasercut parts work, however I'll be testing the block as soon as I can actually print something.""" ;
