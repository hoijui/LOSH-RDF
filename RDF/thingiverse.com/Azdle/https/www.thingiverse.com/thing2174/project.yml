function: "This is just a simple mounting plate for the Tech Zone Remix Electronics that are being sold on the RepRap Forums. As these electronics are smaller, I felt it was a waste to use the full sized mounting plates. All the electronics mount on this one plate.\r\nI have almost everything wired using this on my Mendel. This is not the final design. Also, there is still not yet a way to mount the Thermocouple board. That will be coming soon as a separate file.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nVersion 0.2 Changes:\r\n*Cutout a section on the left that could have caused issues with the x-axis belt\r\n*Added two a new pieces that hold the DC barrel jack and the USB->Serial board.\r\n*Added horizontal adjustment to the top mounting point.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.3 Changes:\r\n*Fixed the USBBlock and its mounting plate.\r\n\r\nNote: I have now verified that the lasercut parts work, however I'll be testing the block as soon as I can actually print something."
