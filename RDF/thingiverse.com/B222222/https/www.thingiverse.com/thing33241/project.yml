function: "This is a katana I designed for my halloween ninja costume.  Made out of .20\" thick plywood, but could easily be made in any other material of a thickness between about .15\" and .25\".  I fastened mine together using glue and 3/32 inch diameter slotted spring pins (http://www.mcmaster.com/#slotted-spring-pins/=jwk52x), but any suitable fastener capable of holding together 3x the thickness of your chosen material is fine.  Redimension the 6 fastener cutouts on each sword profile accordingly if you choose to use another fastener.\r\n\r\nI recommend wrapping the handle in paracord/ fabric/ something else that looks cool- makes a nice aesthetic, and feels better in the hand.  Also, wrap the blade in tin foil to give it a metallic appearance.\r\n\r\nThe version uploaded is 24 inches long.  In the hand, it feels like a \"short sword.\"  If you want/ can laser cut a longer version, \r\n\r\nThere are also 8 ninja stars included, which are supremely cool.  Useful for annoying friends and enemies alike.\r\n\r\nI've made this design licensed as a public domain dedication, cause I'm generous like that.  If you want to make a business selling these katanas, go ahead- I have no means or desire to stop you."
