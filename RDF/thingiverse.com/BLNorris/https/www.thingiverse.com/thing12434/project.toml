function = "I Designed this because I liked the vertical axis style, but none of the current designs that I found would let you use current extruder designs.\r\nThis lets you use a Gregs Wade style extruder, and most anything with the same style mount.\r\n\r\nEdit: I have redesigned the carriage bit to have holes for mounting different attachments.\r\nThere is now one that will hold a Gregs Wades style extruder, and one for mounting a dremel flexible shaft to it.\r\nThe top holes are spaces so a fan can be mounted to the carriage, or for extra accessory bits \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have uploaded the SolidWorks2012 files below, as well as the assembly and the support files as a rar.\r\n\r\nEdit: Uploaded videos of this here\r\nhttp://youtu.be/RT0YAYO6GR0\r\nhttp://youtu.be/NgFt0bLryy4"
