function: "I designed this necklace to give to my girlfriend. \r\nHope she doesn't see it on here before I give it to her :)\r\n\r\nI made it in blender, and for some reason couldn't get the top tube to connect to the bottom half properly, but it still printed fine.\r\n\r\nIt has a 6mm tube with 4mm hole for a chain.\r\n\r\nI printed in PLA, which looks soo good."
