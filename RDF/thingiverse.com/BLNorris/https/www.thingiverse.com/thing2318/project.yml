function: "This is a Mecanum wheel\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel\r\nI saw that somebody else had a printable one, but it was not shared. So I made this.\r\n\r\nYou will have to use glue, or acetone, or something to accach the pieces together. \r\n\r\nThis is designed to use 3mm filament as axles for the wheels.\r\n\r\nI also uploaded the blender file, in case anyone wants to change stuff."
