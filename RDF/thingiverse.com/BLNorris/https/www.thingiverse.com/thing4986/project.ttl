    okh:function """This is a redesigned Huxley inspired by the Prusa simplified Mendel.\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4148\r
\r
It uses the PLA Bushings like \r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4434\r
I modified the scad script to use 6mm rods.\r
(basically just put in 6mm for rod size and 12mm for width)\r
\r
I have also redesigned the X and Y motor brackets to be able to use nema 14 or 17 motors. The Z now takes 2 nema 14 motors.\r
\r
I designed it around 1/4" threaded rods and #6-32 bolts. It should work with 6mm rods and M6 bolts, but I'm not sure.\r
\r
This should work with the same extruder as the regular Huxley. I believe.\r
\r
The image is of the current build status, it needs the Y Stage and some belts on it before it will go, and an extruder. But the Z movement is working well so far.\r
\r
Edit: Got the belts in and installed on the X Axis\r

\r
The design files are in SolidWorks\r
\r
Edit 12-8-10: Found a problem with the X-axis parts.\r
the bolts used to tighten the rods in place had a nut bigger than the rod, so I put in a slot on the side. This weakened the structure to the point where tightening the bolts enough to keep tension on the belt, it would break the piece. I redesigned them after finding "Undersized Hex Nuts" (McMaster carr part 90760A007 for 6-32) which allow me to insert them the same as prusajr originally had. I also added more material to the sides to help with this. I am currently printing them out for testing.\r
\r
Edit 12-9-10: I added more material to the x-axis parts to make them a bit stiffer again, I didnt get a chance to test the last version, so it may work just fine.""" ;
