function = "A pretty simple shotshell holder with a flat back.  Intended to be glued to side of my shotgun's receiver with E-6000 glue.  It's to make reloads a bit faster for sport shooting matches.\r\n\r\nThe design holds shotshells just fine.  But whether the glue will be enough is another story.  On one hand nothing I have glued with E-6000 has come apart on its own.  On the other hand, being stuck to a shotgun (which gets hot) and subjected to stress of repeatedly pushing in and pulling out shells on top of it all is beyond what I normally put E-6000 through.\r\n\r\nP.S.  Hahahaha \"sports\" isn't even close to being a Category choice for things.  'Other' it is!"
