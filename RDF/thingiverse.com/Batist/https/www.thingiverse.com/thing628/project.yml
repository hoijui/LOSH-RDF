function: "This is a first attempt to make a printable lung model for educational purposes.\r\n* It has several bifurcations (7)\r\n* It is hollow.\r\n* It is about 12cm high (tallest I printed so far)\r\n\r\nIt also looks like the beginning of a tree, perhaps I could grow some plants in it...\r\nAnd I guess it would make a nice fountain too. :-)"
