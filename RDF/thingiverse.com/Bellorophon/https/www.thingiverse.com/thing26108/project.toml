function = "This is a linear bearing holder for use in the Ultimaker's axis drive system.  This will replace the stock wooden blocks that only hold brass bearings.  It will also clamp a drive belt and hold one end of a 6mm axis rod. I combined Gijs's belt tensioner(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19892) with this linear bearing holder.  I modified Gijs belt tensioner to give it a sharper curve and merged it with this holder combo."
