function = "outdoor light cover bullet shape. Used for lights which hang down and have no bottom support. 5 1/4 across to fit standard US light fixture sizes. WARNING: only use this cover with LED light bulbs with a WATTAGE of 2 to 3 WATTS. Anything else is too hot and may catch Fire! Aside from that it is an awesome light which has been printed and in use now."
