    okh:function """My Prusa X-Carriage is very flimsy because of all of the cutouts for various extruder mounting options.  When I printed it from the git repo I should have turned a bunch off to make a more solid carriage, but once I glued it in I decided to live with it.  Also, my extruder has a big motor and it's perched on a narrow, printed GrooveMount adapter http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7107 .  I never used the MakerGear adapter because it was cut off-center (for an original Wades).  While testing out Marlin firmware at 200mm/s (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejt8CVV0Yzk) I noticed a lot of vibration in my extruder.\r
\r
So to give the extruder a more stable platform I laser cut a big adapter plate.  It has lots of contact area with the X carriage and allows me to tighten the mounting screws very firmly without flexing the carriage and causing it to bind.  I'm half tempted to epoxy the plate right to the X carriage, but the improvement is quite visible just like this.""" ;
