    okh:function """I am working on a direct drive extruder using MakerGear components.  The aluminum block that mounts the hot end to the extruder has a mounting footprint compatible with the Makerbot mk7 (and mk8) extruders.  This mounting plate will mount both types of extruder to a Prusa X-Carriage.\r
\r
There are many reasons you probably shouldn't use this part not the least of which is that I have never tried it with a Makerbot hot end and it may very well mash the hot end right into your X carriage.  And since you don't have my experimental MG hot end mount you are out of luck for now!\r

Here's a video of it in action:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyMfSAiMk0I\r

Update: I had to make another one out of 1/8" Aluminum plate because the wooden version let the heat travel too far up the barrel.  It extruded fine as long as you kept going but if you stopped for a while it would get very sticky.""" ;
