    okh:function """After I stole the old paper towel holder for the craft room, my wife bought a Polder KTH-6066-87 Single Tear Paper Towel Holder ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012U7TB0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=benjac-20 ) which gets rave reviews on Amazon.  It has a heavy, grippy base which holds the roll while you tear off an individual towel.\r
\r
Ours arrived with a cracked finial (a little cap that twist-locks into the top and prevents the paper towel roll from lifting off).  It's not even necessary for proper operation so rather than send it back I decided to print a replacement.\r
\r
The SCAD is a ridiculously simple bit of code to produce the twist-lock base and then it incorporates the famous heart to decorate the top.  You could choose any other object, of course.  The heart could even be much bigger (as is it doesn't even stop the roll from coming off).""" ;
