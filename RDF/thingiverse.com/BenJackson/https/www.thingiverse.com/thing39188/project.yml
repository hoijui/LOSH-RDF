function: "This laser module holder drops a laser pointer into the beam path of the laser cutter when the door is open.  When the door is closed it swings the laser up out of the way.  This is an alternative to using a beam splitter or a knife-edge mirror to join the red laser with the cutting beam.\r\n\r\nThis is intended for the http://www.buildlog.net/ 2.x Laser cutter, but could be adapted to others as well.\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by http://danielbauen.com/make/index.php/laser-cutter/laser-inline-red-laser-pointer-solution-without-using-an-extra-m/ which I have admired for some time, but the STLs provided there have some features that make them awkward to print."
