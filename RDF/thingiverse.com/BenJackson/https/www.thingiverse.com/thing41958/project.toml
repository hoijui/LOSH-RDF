function = "A 200mm filament spool very similar to the plastic ones used by suppliers like protoparadigm.  The thickness is reduced to the hub thickness (one side of the plastic spools is inset) so it should be compatible with any spool holder if cut with the 52mm inner hole.  I intend to use them to spool up my few remaining loose 1kg batches of filament."
