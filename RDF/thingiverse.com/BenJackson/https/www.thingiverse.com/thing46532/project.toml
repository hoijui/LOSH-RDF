function = "The IKEA PAX is a 32mm European cabinet system.  It has many accessories in the KOMPLEMENT family including this pull-out clothes rail.  It is designed to mount to the bottom of a shelf, but I wanted to mount it to the side of the cabinet.  These brackets adapt the mounting ears of the KOMPLEMENT rail to the 32mm shelf pins on the cabinet.\r\n\r\nThis was a huge CAD victory:  I mocked up the side of the cabinet and the ears of the rail and drew brackets to join them up.  The very first print (with some hole cleanup) mounted to the rail and the holes perfectly aligned to the cabinet.  No trial and error at all!\r\n\r\nThe front bracket is slightly crooked in the STL (relative to the axes) due to the way I flipped it onto its side for printing, but the part itself is square."
