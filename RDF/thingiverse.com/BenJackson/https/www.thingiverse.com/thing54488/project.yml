function: "A laser cut tool caddy for a small tool tote.  I wanted vertical storage for quick access and the tote just didn't have the right sort of loops/webbing for the job.  It's got 3 layers (the bottom is mostly solid) with custom cutouts for each tool.  This thing is mostly for your inspiration -- it's unlikely you have all the same tools!\r\n\r\nIn case you're curious, here's what's loaded in it:  I really like the Lutz ratcheting screwdriver with integrated bit storage.  I've had one for a long time and I just bought a couple more.  The Channellock 430 (the large blue-handled pliers) aren't my favorite due to the shape of the jaws.  The Pittsburgh (Harbor Freight) adjustable wrench is actually quite nice and has an accurate scale in inches and mm.  The Irwin (Vise Grip) needle nose pliers are also new and they don't close as cleanly as I'd like (e.g. a piece of paper will slide right out without a strong squeeze on the handles).\r\n\r\nLutz 15-in-1 Ratchet Screwdriver\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z36SDI/tag=benjac-20\r\n\r\nChannellock 526 6.5-Inch Slip Joint Plier\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SBD9/tag=benjac-20\r\n\r\nChannellock 430 2-Inch Jaw Capacity 10-Inch Tongue and Groove Plier\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B00002N5JF/tag=benjac-20\r\n\r\nStanley 20-807 10-Inch Mini-Hack Light-Duty Utility Saw\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009OYGD/tag=benjac-20\r\n\r\nEmpire Level 581-9 9-Inch Magnetic Aluminum Torpedo Level\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004YYFM/tag=benjac-20\r\n\r\n8\" 2-In-1 Wide Mouth Adjustable Wrench\r\nhttp://www.harborfreight.com/2-in-1-wide-mouth-adjustable-wrench-67128.html\r\n\r\nVise-Grip 2078208 8-Inch Linemans Plier\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0UJVK/tag=benjac-20\r\n\r\nVise-Grip 2078218 8-Inch Long Nose Plier and Comfort Grip\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0S4Y4/tag=benjac-20\r\n\r\nSwanson Tool SO101 7-inch Speed Square\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002255O/tag=benjac-20"
