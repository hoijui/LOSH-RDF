    okh:function """My Lincoln SP-175+ gave up its own cart to another welder so I tried putting it on a Harbor Freight MIG cart ( http://www.harborfreight.com/welding-cart-90305.html ).  Due to the sloped top shelf and the centrally located gas inlet I couldn't get the welder where I wanted without running into the tank (80cf).  There's plenty of room on the tank tray so I moved it back about 3" with this bracket.  The 80cf tank is 7" diameter (same as 40 and 125 and fits what I thought was a 150).\r
\r
I'm thinking of modifying the design to remove the spacer so I can use it on another cart and possibly against a wall for storage.""" ;
