function = "After building a Thing-o-Matic I had to create something from scratch.  I was inspired by a nearby Cadbury Creme Egg and made this small egg cup.  I was designing it with CSG in my head with the idea of using OpenSCAD (cylinder minus torus minus sphere, basically) when I noticed the Alibre icon and decided to see if \"revolve boss\" would get the job done quicker.\r\n\r\nIn some sense the design is parametric, since you could load the AD_PRT file and modify the dimensions in the sketch (or even drag the shapes around within the constraints I set, like the 3mm top lip).\r\n\r\nUpdate:  Perhaps it inspired this real egg cup?  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6620"
