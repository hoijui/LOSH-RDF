    okh:function """After building a Thing-o-Matic I had to create something from scratch.  I was inspired by a nearby Cadbury Creme Egg and made this small egg cup.  I was designing it with CSG in my head with the idea of using OpenSCAD (cylinder minus torus minus sphere, basically) when I noticed the Alibre icon and decided to see if "revolve boss" would get the job done quicker.\r
\r
In some sense the design is parametric, since you could load the AD_PRT file and modify the dimensions in the sketch (or even drag the shapes around within the constraints I set, like the 3mm top lip).\r
\r
Update:  Perhaps it inspired this real egg cup?  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6620""" ;
