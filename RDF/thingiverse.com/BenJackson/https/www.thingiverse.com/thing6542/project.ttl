The neck doesn't really need to be that thick for strength, it just ensured that there was enough print time per layer to avoid slumping.  The skeinforge "cool" setting plus a DC motor extruder made some interesting artwork when I tried it:  The consistency of the cooldown orbit created a secondary wall with an odd shape.\r

I had to experiment with Alibre's STL export to avoid having too many facets on the small neck.  Initially the neck was coming out with something like 36 faces.  I think I could have made the base rounder by also setting the "maximum deviation" appropriately.  It's a dimensional setting but the dimension is not disclosed -- I assumed mm, but perhaps it's cm.""" ;
