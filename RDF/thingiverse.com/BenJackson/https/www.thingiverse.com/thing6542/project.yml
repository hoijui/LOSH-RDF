function: "Two of these clamped back-to-back on the side of a box provide clamping and strain relief for 5/16\" (8mm) OD tubing.  I made them to support the tube on the side of my filament feeder box.\r\n\r\nThe neck doesn't really need to be that thick for strength, it just ensured that there was enough print time per layer to avoid slumping.  The skeinforge \"cool\" setting plus a DC motor extruder made some interesting artwork when I tried it:  The consistency of the cooldown orbit created a secondary wall with an odd shape.\r\n\r\nI had to experiment with Alibre's STL export to avoid having too many facets on the small neck.  Initially the neck was coming out with something like 36 faces.  I think I could have made the base rounder by also setting the \"maximum deviation\" appropriately.  It's a dimensional setting but the dimension is not disclosed -- I assumed mm, but perhaps it's cm."
