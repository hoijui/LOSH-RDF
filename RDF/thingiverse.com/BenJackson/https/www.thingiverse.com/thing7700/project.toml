function = "In the spirit of \"accessible\" this is a top filament guide for the Accessible Wade's that you can flip out of the way for unobstructed access to the feeder.  It is only secured by the front tension bolt so it can be removed altogether with minimum fuss.\r\n\r\nWhile installed it helpfully guides your filament toward the hobbed bolt and takes the load of any filament feed tube you are using."
