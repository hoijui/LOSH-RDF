function = "Small low power 3 phase A.C. / D.C. generator designed for low energy applications using wind or water power. The generator is stackable allowing you to build up a working system of multiple modules to provide the voltage or current required. Connecting a module in parrallel boosts the current and connecting in series boosts the voltage.\r\n\r\nIf this has been useful for you then please consider buying me a coffee, it goes towards funding more projects like this:\r\nhttps://www.paypal.me/rowlandtechnology"
