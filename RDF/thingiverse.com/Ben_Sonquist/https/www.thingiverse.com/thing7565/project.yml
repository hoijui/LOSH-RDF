function: This is an armband case concept I tried out.  I realize that they can be bought online for a few bucks but why buy when you can make. The IPod and case are actually two separate pieces but the STL merged them as one. I realize that this is not very helpful if anyone wants to make one so I'll post the pieces separately soon.
