function = "I was getting tired of using feeler gauges etc to level the TOM stage and picked up a Dial Indicator on eBay\r\n( http://stores.ebay.com/General-Tool-And-Supply-Company  ). Then made the dial indicator holder from \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13795.\r\n\r\nEverything works great, makes leveling a breeze. Now, where to stow the Dial Indicator and clip? Solution, design a mount and clip it behind the extruder while not being used, also adds some weight to the Z stage which helps in operation."
