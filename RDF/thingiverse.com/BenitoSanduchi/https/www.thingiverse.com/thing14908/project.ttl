    okh:function """Carefully hand modeled in C4D, this lovely box cradles your BlinkM controller in loving ABS.  You'll need a rubber band or something similarly classy to keep the lid on, though it fits pretty snuggly.  There is also no built-in means of attaching it to anything (like your TOM's z-stage assembly).  Finally, there's nothing really holding the board in place, so it can jiggle around.  Easy solutions abound. I settled for double sided mounting tape and a test cylinder. \r
\r
There are holes for DC power, 4-pin out to your RGB lights, and 4-pin in from Arduino or a LinkM.  The LinkM fits right in there.\r
\r
I just wanted something to hold our blinkM in a happy box.  Said box could be improved in a million ways.""" ;
