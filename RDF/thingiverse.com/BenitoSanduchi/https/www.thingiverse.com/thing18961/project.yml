function: "Timmy is a critter of some sort.  He has excellent hearing and enjoying miniature golf and long walks by the sewage treatment plant.\r\n\r\nI modeled this as a planned entry for the pocket monster contest, but ran out of time and never got around to modeling his body.  \r\n\r\nThis model is hollow inside from the botom up to about eye-level, making it perfect for creepily swapping Timmy onto any headless dolls you may have laying around.  Also saves on plastic."
