function = "This is a printable 3D scan of an old, terrifying children's toy.  Scanned with 123D Catch and cleaned the mesh in C4D.  Also added a small pedestal because the interface of the toy and surface it was sitting on were not read well in the scan.  \n\n\n\nHad to shrink the model a bit to fit in my Z-envelope.  \n\n\n\nI plan to try (scanning) again and hope for improved resolution and less errors to fix."
