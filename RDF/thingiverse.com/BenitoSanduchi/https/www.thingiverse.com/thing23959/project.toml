function = "I wanted to jack up my new MendelMax so I can mount my power supply under there, but didn't like the look of any of the legs I could find on Thingiverse so I made these.  They match the profile of the existing base pieces to keep things sexy and bolt through the bottom holes. \r\n\r\nThey are 1.8\" (approx 45.75mm) tall, which was more than enough to fit my power supply and primarily sized to fit the 50mm bolts I already had. \r\n\r\nI'm a mesh modeler, so I don't have SCAD to share, sorry."
