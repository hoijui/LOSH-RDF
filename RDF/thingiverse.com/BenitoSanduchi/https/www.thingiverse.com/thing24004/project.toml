function = "I designed this thing, to take advantage of the endstop flag holders on the Aleph Objects Z Motor Mounts without having to mount the endstop on the X-End.  Ultimately, it's more complicated than necessary and I should have just used a standard rod-mounted holder.  \r\n\r\nCool things about it?  Sliding nut trap.   Sexy nested curves.  It works and is fairly easy to adjust."
