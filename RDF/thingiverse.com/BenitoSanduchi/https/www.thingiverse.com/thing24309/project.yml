function: "The University of Montana's iconic Grizzly Bear that flanks the western side of the oval.  The sculpture  was designed by Rudy Autio, one of the fathers of modern ceramics, who sculpted the bear in clay.  It was cast in bronze and set in place in 1968.  \n\n\n\nI scanned it with 123D Catch on a day with horrible sun glare on one side.  I'm amazed that it worked.  \n\n\n\nPart of my \"originals\" MFA thesis work. More information on the project can be seen here: benmalouf.com/originals"
