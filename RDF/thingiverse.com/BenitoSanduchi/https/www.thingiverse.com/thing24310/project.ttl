Scanned the pig with 123D Catch.  It was a crappy ceramic candle holder thingy with a pig dressed in winter clothes.  The face was all I needed and was all I kept in the file.  The piggy STL is attached but isn't print-ready.    



Part of my "originals" MFA thesis work. More information on the project can be seen here: benmalouf.com/originals""" ;
