function: "I put a pig head on the iconic grizzly statue on The University of Montana campus.  If you've been reading about Montana's sexual assault problem in the news lately, you may feel this is especially appropriate.  \n\n\n\nScanned the pig with 123D Catch.  It was a crappy ceramic candle holder thingy with a pig dressed in winter clothes.  The face was all I needed and was all I kept in the file.  The piggy STL is attached but isn't print-ready.    \n\n\n\nPart of my \"originals\" MFA thesis work. More information on the project can be seen here: benmalouf.com/originals"
