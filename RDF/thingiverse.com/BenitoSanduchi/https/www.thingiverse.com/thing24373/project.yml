function: "I wanted to know what would happen if I copied a 3D copy, and then copied that copy, and so on, so that's what I did.\r\n\r\nAll scans were done using an identical process with 123D Catch.  The change from 3rd to 4th generation was so minimal that I chose to stop there.  \r\n\r\nPart of my \"originals\" MFA thesis work. More information on the project can be seen here: benmalouf.com/originals"
