A geary urn.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can burn things (like beloved family pets) and put their ashen residue inside!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr you can put an LED tea light in it and pretend it's full of angry fire spirits!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1/26/13 - Currently available for sale at the  3DEA/Openhouse Gallery in NYC along with several of my other designs (and more awesome objects by others)!
