function = "Cups!  Joy!  \r\n\r\nMade these specifically to test Taulman 618 nylon watertightness and layer bonding.  But they have useful finger grips and they look nice so I decided to share.  \r\n\r\nThe regular and small tumblers get a really cool triangular tessellation pattern in stl form that looks awesome when printed.  The smooth version is, uh, smoother.     \r\n\r\nAbout the nylon prints:\r\nThe big cup (smooth) is only 1 perimeter thick and as you can see in the pictures can be crushed without permanent damage.  It is very flexible.  \r\n\r\nThe small one is 3 perimeters thick and I can barely squeeze the opposing rims together.  When I do, it still springs right back."
