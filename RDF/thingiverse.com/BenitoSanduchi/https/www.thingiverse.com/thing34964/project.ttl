\r
Made these specifically to test Taulman 618 nylon watertightness and layer bonding.  But they have useful finger grips and they look nice so I decided to share.  \r
\r
The regular and small tumblers get a really cool triangular tessellation pattern in stl form that looks awesome when printed.  The smooth version is, uh, smoother.     \r
\r
About the nylon prints:\r
The big cup (smooth) is only 1 perimeter thick and as you can see in the pictures can be crushed without permanent damage.  It is very flexible.  \r
\r
The small one is 3 perimeters thick and I can barely squeeze the opposing rims together.  When I do, it still springs right back.""" ;
