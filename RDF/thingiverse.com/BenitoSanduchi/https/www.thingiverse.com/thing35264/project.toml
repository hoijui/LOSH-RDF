function = "The Lowpoly 4000 represents a paradigm shift in modern additive object manufacturing.  Not only is it unwieldy and overlarge, but it's tippy and prone to phase shifts.  Use of tongs and or safety goggle recommended.  \r\n\r\nThank you for enjoying Lowpoly 4000.  Please have a safe and productive holiday season joy time.  \r\n\r\n1/26/13 - Currently available for sale at the  3DEA/Openhouse Gallery in NYC along with several of my other designs (and many more awesome objects by others)!  If you want one, don't have a printer, and are in New York, now's your chance.  The store will be open through February 17.   :D\r\nhttp://3dea.openhouse.me/3dea/"
