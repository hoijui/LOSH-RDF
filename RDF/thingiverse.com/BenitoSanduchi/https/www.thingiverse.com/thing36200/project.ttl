I tried adding textures, but ended up liking the smooth one best.  In part, I think, because Slic3r 0.9.7 seems to be a major improvement and the surface is just perfect. \r
 \r
I was also hoping that the nylon these were printed with would make it flexible enough so I could open the top, but that didn't quite work.  Need to try a smooth one with a single perimeter next.    \r
\r
SplatBag was an earlier version that I think I may still prefer.  \r
\r
Update \r
12/2/12 - I just added another "splatbag" that is larger and smoother than the small, unsmooth one.  Enjoy!  \r
1/26/13 - Currently available for sale at the  3DEA/Openhouse Gallery in NYC along with several of my other designs (and more awesome objects by others)!  If you want one, don't have a printer, and are in New York, now's your chance.""" ;
