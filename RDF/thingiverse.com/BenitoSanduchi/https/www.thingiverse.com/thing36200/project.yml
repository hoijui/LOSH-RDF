function: "I don't know, there's just something about a good ol fashioned gunny sack.  \r\nI tried adding textures, but ended up liking the smooth one best.  In part, I think, because Slic3r 0.9.7 seems to be a major improvement and the surface is just perfect. \r\n \r\nI was also hoping that the nylon these were printed with would make it flexible enough so I could open the top, but that didn't quite work.  Need to try a smooth one with a single perimeter next.    \r\n\r\nSplatBag was an earlier version that I think I may still prefer.  \r\n\r\nUpdate \r\n12/2/12 - I just added another \"splatbag\" that is larger and smoother than the small, unsmooth one.  Enjoy!  \r\n1/26/13 - Currently available for sale at the  3DEA/Openhouse Gallery in NYC along with several of my other designs (and more awesome objects by others)!  If you want one, don't have a printer, and are in New York, now's your chance."
