Pictured at 70% scale with one perimeter in Taulman 618 nylon.  \r\n\r\n6/2/15 - Added a couple variations that didn't warrant a separate post.   \r\n1/26/13 - Currently available for sale at the 3DEA/Openhouse Gallery in NYC along with several of my other designs (and more awesome objects by others)! If you want one, don't have a printer, and are in New York, now's your chance. The store will be open through February 17. :D"
