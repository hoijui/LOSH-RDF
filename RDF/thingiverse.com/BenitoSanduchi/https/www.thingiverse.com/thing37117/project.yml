function: "Pretty.  Seasonal.  Pretty seasonal.  \r\nThe round base is arguably prettier, but the tri-base is more mathematically true to the fractal.  Though I skipped the second iteration for some reason.  \r\n12/9 - Thanks for all the feedback.  :)  Added a couple pictures of these prints after I dyed them light blue.  You can dye nylon any color with RIT dyes which is just awesome.  \r\n1/26/13 - Currently available for sale at the  3DEA/Openhouse Gallery in NYC along with several of my other designs (and more awesome objects by others)!  If you want one, don't have a printer, and are in New York, now's your chance.  The store will be open through February 17."
