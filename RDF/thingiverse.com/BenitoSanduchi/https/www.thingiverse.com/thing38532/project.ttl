    okh:function """Was playing with another lofting profile in C4D, the twisted star.  Looks like a saw blade to me.  \r
All printed in Taulman 618 nylon and dyed different colors.  I printed all the larger vessels on a 1/4" piece of poplar wood as the build surface heated to 60 degrees.  Perfect adhesion and easy release.  Wood is good!  \r
The little one was printed on our Sailfish-running Thing-o-Matic in the new 1.75mm Taulman 618.  I have a spring-loaded idler on an MK7 and had no problems at all with accelerated printing at 60mm/sec.  Printed on masking tape and it stuck fine, though I do recommend wood for larger prints.  As usual, Sailfish just rocks and the print is absolutely beautiful, hence all the close ups.""" ;
