function = "Deer ate the carrot nose off of our snowman.  My over-tired 4-year old son was very upset and my wife said \"your Dad will print you a new one that the deer won't eat,\" and he calmed down.  A quick search of Thingiverse revealed that I would have to model my own.  \r\nI did so very quickly and it's not my best, but here it is.  Ready to print and be installed on a snowman near you."
