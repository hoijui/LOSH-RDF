function = "A 40mm fan holder for cooling extruded material.\r\nThe air output is very close to the nozzle output resulting in minimal airflow to the hot end.\r\nA axial fan is used so the airflow inside don't have to change direction so less pressure buildup.\r\n\r\nThe Y+ motion must be limited (-5mm) because it can hit the Z table legs.
