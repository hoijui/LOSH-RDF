function = "My Ultimaker is located in a shared room and the sounds it make are not liked by everyone as much as by myself.\r\nEspecially the wooden desk, on witch it stands, amplifies the sound of the motors.\r\n\r\nThen i found some old unused springs and made a damper witch uncouple the Ultimaker from its desk.\r\nThe dampers reduce the sounds tremendous, in particular with high accelerations.\r\nOn the photographs you can see the sound level is reduced at least 3 dB which is quit a lot in a living room.\r\n\r\nI'm sure no one has these springs at home so the sketchup file is only added to give an idea of design."
