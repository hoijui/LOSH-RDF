Especially the wooden desk, on witch it stands, amplifies the sound of the motors.\r
\r
Then i found some old unused springs and made a damper witch uncouple the Ultimaker from its desk.\r
The dampers reduce the sounds tremendous, in particular with high accelerations.\r
On the photographs you can see the sound level is reduced at least 3 dB which is quit a lot in a living room.\r
\r
I'm sure no one has these springs at home so the sketchup file is only added to give an idea of design.""" ;
