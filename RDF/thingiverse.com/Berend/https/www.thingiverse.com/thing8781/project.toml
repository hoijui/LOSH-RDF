function = "Two little tools to see if your Ultimaker XY guiding rods timing belts are correctly aligned according to the 'sliding blocks'\r\nThe optimum is that the timing belt of the X -rod has no Y component, so the 2 pullies and the 'sliding block' must be in the same Y-plane.\r\nThis should reduce mechanical stress in the system and gives a more balanced load for the belts/pulleys.\r\nIt can be difficult to see if the pulley is mounted straight above/below the rods.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tool has a complexity/added value ratio of 1 (It can boost your Ultimaker performance with at least 0.000005%)"
