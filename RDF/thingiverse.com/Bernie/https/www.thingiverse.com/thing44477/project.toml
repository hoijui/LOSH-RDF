function = "Spent most of 2012 assembling a 3d printer from salvaged printer and PC bits.  Successfully printed 3 objects during December 2012 and have since been brushing up software skills.\r\n\r\nThe .stl files were imported into Blender and combined. I also rendered the image shown above. \r\n\r\nThe .stl file for the Thinker comes from lampmaker on Thingiverse who got the file from MIT CSAIL database and the file for the Fountain is from robmyers  on Thingiverse who commissioned it from dustycloud.org."
