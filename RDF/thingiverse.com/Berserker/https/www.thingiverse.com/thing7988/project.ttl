    okh:function """Hi,  
Because I'm not allowed to use the e*bot word, I renamed this thing to egg drawer.  
this is a complete printable egg drawer  
it is also work in progress (for now) but submitting it next week seems a little bit silly to me.  
for now, the egg mountings are still to be designed (maybe we can 'borrow' them from somewhere).  
!! AND SOMEONE DID, see hbs's page http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13960 for those things, Thanks.  
new pen holder (PenHolder-7.stl)  

this design is moved to https://www.youmagine.com/designs/eggbot  

A helpful placeholder to show people that you've moved all of your designs to YOUMAGINE because of Thingiverse/Makerbot's ludicrous attempt at patenting for themselves designs which were created by people within their community:
