function: "Hi,  \nBecause I'm not allowed to use the e*bot word, I renamed this thing to egg drawer.  \nthis is a complete printable egg drawer  \nit is also work in progress (for now) but submitting it next week seems a little bit silly to me.  \nfor now, the egg mountings are still to be designed (maybe we can 'borrow' them from somewhere).  \n!! AND SOMEONE DID, see hbs's page http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13960 for those things, Thanks.  \nnew pen holder (PenHolder-7.stl)  \n\nthis design is moved to https://www.youmagine.com/designs/eggbot  \n\nA helpful placeholder to show people that you've moved all of your designs to YOUMAGINE because of Thingiverse/Makerbot's ludicrous attempt at patenting for themselves designs which were created by people within their community:   \n\nhttp://traverseda.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/makerbot-blatently-steals-and-patents-a-community-design/"
