function: "For those of us in the US, Thanksgiving is coming, and it's one of my favorite holidays.\r\n\r\nWhy, you ask?\r\n\r\nPie. Oh, do I ever dig on some pie.\r\n\r\nLast year I made a few pies for people over here at MakerBot, but this year we're just way too big and awesome for one man to bake for. Thus, I figured I'd release the recipe for my favorite pie in the world, and the one I only get to make once or twice a year- bourbon pecan pie!\r\n\r\nJust so you all know, you can feel free to replace bourbon with water if you don't like the taste, as the important thing is the pecans expanding. That said, most of the alcohol itself cooks out of the pie in the oven - so don't worry about getting tipsy from a slice!\r\n\r\nIf anyone's into it, it's sort of a commitment of a recipe, but boy is it worth it. Feel free to make it or derive, just keep any edits public! I'd love to hear if anyone adds it to their feast this year.\r\n\r\nHappy Thanksgiving!"
