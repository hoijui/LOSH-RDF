function: "After having problems with jpearce's safety razor, I decided to try and fix it. After a few days of tinkering with it, I decided to address many of the design issues, practically reworking the entire thing from scratch. I give you my Koffin-Top safety razor. I liked the results so much, I use it every time I shave now. I hope you like it!  \r\nSee it in action and learn more here: http://youtu.be/w4Xzr-y7T3w  \r\nRead the instructions for updates on this design!\r\n1/16/2019: I have noticed a boom in popularity since the recent Gillette fiasco. Gillette blades are quite nice, but for those interested, I usually use Wilkinson Sword or Feather blades in mine. Thanks for everyone who has downloaded/shared/used this design!"
