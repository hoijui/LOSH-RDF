function = "Box and lid for miniUSB/5v to 4.1 volt smart charging board designed for safely charging 3.7v Li-ion batteries.  Has one hole for the miniUSB port and another for the cable and a stress relief.  One lid has holes to view the charging and charge complete LEDs, the other is solid.  I now use this to field charge a tactical light which is used on my bicycle helmet after dark to help find camp."
