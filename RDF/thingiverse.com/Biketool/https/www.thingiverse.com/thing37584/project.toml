function = "This is a bezel cover which fits newer GMT Master, Submariner, and other watches with a 41mm bezel.\r\nIt is a work in progress as I want to add marked five minute blocks, and one minute hashes.\r\nThis bezel cap protects the watch from damage, it possibly also disguises an expensive watch with some plastic if traveling in a high crime area without reducing the timekeeping functionality."
