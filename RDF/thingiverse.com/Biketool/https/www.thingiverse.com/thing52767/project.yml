function: This is the washer and cap with channels for attaching a bent wire and machine screw mic boom to hard shell headphones to make something similar to my good David Clark aviation headset.  I made this so my boy could have a headset for his pilot costume without risking my $300 headset.  Afterwards I will have a comfortable but very tough Skype/VOIP headset for the computer where the mike securely folds out of the way when watching movies or listening to music.
