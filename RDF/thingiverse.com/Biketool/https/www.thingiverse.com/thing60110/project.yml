function: "This is a replacement part control stick assembly for my kids cheap micro IR RC helicopter controller(gray in pic).  Probably a standard part for RC toys so view the .stl in Meshlab and compare it to your broken part.\r\nI also included the USB charger board enclosure I made when we first got the toy as the included charger burns through AA batteries fast."
