    okh:function """This is a small approx 34mm by 34mm creeper keyring. I thought the other one on here was too flat for 3D printing so I went about making one with some texture to it. Each different colour is at a different height, and the mouth and eyes are cut straight through. It is only 3mm thick so might have to make the layers a bit more defined. Haven't got my printer yet but should be getting a 'Solidoodle' in the not so distant future so I thought I would start trying my hand at making things to print. No printer yet so not tested. Tell me what you think!\r
Designed in Sketchup, took me longer than expected due to my n00b-like skillz, or the lack thereof.""" ;
