function: "Who says boys have to have all the alien-shooting fun?  This female human shaped space trooper miniature (suitable for use in a variety of tabletop war or roleplaying games) is armed and ready to kick ass.\r\n\r\nOn my Replicator 2, I could fit a squadron of 27 of these lasses - almost an entire army.  \r\n\r\nFrom zero to military commander in under two days.  Quite the disruptive technology."
