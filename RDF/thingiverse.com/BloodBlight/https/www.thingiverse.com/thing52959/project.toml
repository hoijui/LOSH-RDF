I am waiting for my tax return before buying an Ultimaker.  This is my first submission, and I wanted to make sure I could really make things.  \n\nSO!  Here is my Samsung Galaxy S3 Dock.  It is designed to work with a thin case (about 1 mm).  It is untested, so look over it before printing.  Also, if you print one, PLEASE let me know how it turns out!  It will be a month or two before I can print my copy."
