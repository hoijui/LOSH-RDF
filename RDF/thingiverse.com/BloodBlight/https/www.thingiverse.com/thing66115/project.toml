function = "UPDATE - 2013/06/16  \n\nIf you have an Ultimaker, upgrade to Cura 13.06 or newer!  \nNOTE: It is a closed beta right now, so you will have to hunt for the link.  I will not be posting it because of it's status.  \n\nUPDATE - 2013/06/15  \n\nAlpha 1.8.1:  \n - Resized form to fit smaller screens; the next major release will have a resizable form.  \n - BUG: STLs are being created with a zero height base in some cases.  This is NOT fixed in this revision.  \n\nUPDATE - 2013/04/14  \n\nAlpha 1.8:  \n - Windows XP Support  \n - Added Resolution Limiter  \n - UI Improvements  \n - New Anti-Spike Features  \n\n---  \nLet me start by saying this is an Alpha!  There are features missing and known bugs (specifically in surface duplication).  \n\nI saw a stamp maker the other day but it was Mac only (OmNomNom - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24639), and the author didnâ€™t want to translate it, so, I made one over the weekend!  \n\nI plan to add RGB control, a blur function, additional surface optimizations and an option to smooth high boarders (very useful in B/W [stamp] mode).  \n\nTell me what you think!  Is there something out there that is better than what I have scrapped together?  \n\nHave fun!"
