If you have an Ultimaker, upgrade to Cura 13.06 or newer!  
NOTE: It is a closed beta right now, so you will have to hunt for the link.  I will not be posting it because of it's status.  

UPDATE - 2013/06/15  

Alpha 1.8.1:  
 - Resized form to fit smaller screens; the next major release will have a resizable form.  
 - BUG: STLs are being created with a zero height base in some cases.  This is NOT fixed in this revision.  

UPDATE - 2013/04/14  

Alpha 1.8:  
 - Windows XP Support  
 - Added Resolution Limiter  
 - UI Improvements  
 - New Anti-Spike Features  

---  
Let me start by saying this is an Alpha!  There are features missing and known bugs (specifically in surface duplication).  

I saw a stamp maker the other day but it was Mac only (OmNomNom - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24639), and the author didnâ€™t want to translate it, so, I made one over the weekend!  

I plan to add RGB control, a blur function, additional surface optimizations and an option to smooth high boarders (very useful in B/W [stamp] mode).  

Tell me what you think!  Is there something out there that is better than what I have scrapped together?  

Have fun!""" ;
