function = "This is my first thing and was inspired by thing:1169  \"test overhang flat.stl\"\r\n\r\nCurrently I am tuning my new Ultimaker and wanted to be able to run overhang tests without using a lot of plastic. I also found that I needed greater overhangs.\r\n\r\nTo this end the original model was edited and the offspring checked in Netfabb. \r\n\r\nSo far I have printed and uploaded photos of:\r\n\r\n35 / 30 degree overhangs at 0.05 overhang layer height.\r\n30 / 25 degree overhang at 0.045 overhang layer height.\r\n\r\nI have also finished printing the 20 / 15 degree overhang, with the overhang layer also at 0.045, which I will photograph as soon as I get the energy. It will appear on Blue Bot's photostream:\r\n http://m.flickr.com/#/photos/66753090@N08/\r\n\r\n20 / 15 degree overhang picture now up in flickr\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I chose an older full width version of the file to print and I was too tired to notice. So much for saving plastic :)\r\n\r\nI plan on producing a version of the models with rounded corners to allow the new Marlin firmware to maintain the head speed around the corners.  Hopefully I can do this without making the overhangs artificially easier to print via the 'wrap around' effect."
