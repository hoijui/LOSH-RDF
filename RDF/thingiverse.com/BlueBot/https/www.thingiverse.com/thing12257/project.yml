function: "I suggest you print my latest version here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17602\r\n\r\nI needed a fan shroud that would fit on the right side of the extruder head.\r\n\r\nMy goals were:\r\n\r\n1. No support needed for print (even when not using a fan).\r\n2. Minimal restrictions to airflow.\r\n3. Airflow to also be directed beneath the fan housing to help cool larger prints.\r\n4. Try to balance the airflow to minimise fan stalling.\r\n5. Push fit onto print head (I hate messing with the long threaded rods).\r\n6. No glue needed in assembly.\r\n7. Sufficient gap between the shroud and the aluminium block to prevent melting.\r\n\r\nI managed to print it with no fan, it hasn't melted and it seems to cool the overhangs well on more extreme prints -  so that's definitely a partial success :)\r\n\r\nNote:  Hurricane damage may result downwind to small items left on the printer bed."
