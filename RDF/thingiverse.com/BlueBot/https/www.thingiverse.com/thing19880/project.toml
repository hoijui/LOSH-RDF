function = "This is yet another version of a cooker / stove timer (or other function) control button.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did try a couple of other very good SCAD derived versions, unfortunately for me neither was correct for the Belling cooker. Also unusually for a 3D printing fan, I rebel against the power of SCAD, so tweaking them in SCAD was not an option.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich left me with the 2 minute job of recreating the Belling cooker / stove button in Alibre.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also turned it into an assembly of four buttons with a thin supporting wall between them to ensure a quick and easy print.  Although you can download and print the single version if required.\r\n\r\nI printed the multi part in black ABS and it was very easy to remove the supporting plastic with a hobby knife.  I found this to be much faster than when i was printing the other versions I tried first as individual items."
