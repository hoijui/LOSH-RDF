\r
\r
I did try a couple of other very good SCAD derived versions, unfortunately for me neither was correct for the Belling cooker. Also unusually for a 3D printing fan, I rebel against the power of SCAD, so tweaking them in SCAD was not an option.\r
\r
\r
Which left me with the 2 minute job of recreating the Belling cooker / stove button in Alibre.\r
\r
\r
I also turned it into an assembly of four buttons with a thin supporting wall between them to ensure a quick and easy print.  Although you can download and print the single version if required.\r
\r
I printed the multi part in black ABS and it was very easy to remove the supporting plastic with a hobby knife.  I found this to be much faster than when i was printing the other versions I tried first as individual items.""" ;
