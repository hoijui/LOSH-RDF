function: "We have all been there! How do you explain a several thousand dollars investment into another \"toy\"?  \n\nMy significant other (SO) had some issues with the amount of money and specially time I spent with the TOM. Not even http://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:9461 won her over (though it did get some extra time credit over all).  \n\nI needed something significant ( in monetary terms ) to bring her over to our side.  \n\nIn my case, I had the (mis)fortune of breaking the end of my cars luggage compartment cover.  The cover can be used in the 5 and 7 seat configuration so it has extensions that lock to the ends to make it longer for the 5 seat set up.   \n\nThe broken piece that connected to the left extension was around a bit and I tried the usual super glue cure with terrible results - not only it did not glue properly, it actually made me loose the broken piece altogether (now I see it was divine providence!).  \n\nUpon contacting the dealer to try to buy the offending plastic part and after being politely told to stop being foolish and that Plan B (a whole new cover) was going to cost USD 550, I saw the light! :0  \n\nWhat if I fixed the cover and saved USD 550 (plus tax)? Hero for a few days maybe and even, just maybe a \"isn't nice that you bought the 3d printer thingy?\"   \n\nLofty goals but the difference between courage and ignorance is usually not that big."
