function: "I have seen demonstrations of the Mentos-Diet Coke (now with Coke Zero also) at the Maker Faire in San Mateo CA and always wanted to try it out. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKoB0MHVBvM . Eepbird's early work.\r\n\r\nThis is the video with the cannon pictured here with the round top http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLzzKISAuI\r\n\r\nHere is a printable version that screws on top of the 2 liter Coke bottle to hold the ammunition (Mentos). \r\n\r\nInstall the safety pin once ( the ideia is that it once recoiled to the firing position it will block some exit of coke through the side hole as can be seen in the pictures). Just push it in to reload in other bottle.\r\n\r\nYou can also improve the seal using an O-ring (~26 mm external diameter and ~4 mm ring diameter) or even a garden hose rubber washer. For the video the cannon did not have an O-ring.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 choices of spray: round, flat, cross and V. The round and V work best. The SketchUp file is attached for further editing and modifications.\r\n\r\nI printed the tops in orange to be able to find them easily in case they flew out. Printing the whole set together saves time but leaves a lot of little holes on the parts as the nozzles moves to the next victim. There is probably something in SF35 to handle it but I did not try it. I have attached the separate STL's for those perfectionists out there."
