function: "Inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14802 and trying to find ways to reduce the noise on my TOM, I decided to create this TOM shock absorber in the hope it would help. After all the testing was done, there was actually some reduction on the loudness of the Y stage due to less contact with the desktop where the printer is sitting :) A way to test the potential reduction is to raise the printer away from the desktop and see if it makes less noise. If it does then the dampers will help a bit.\r\n\r\nThe TOM seems now ready to start moving about and with the top up like in my case is starting to resemble a wood and plastic WALL-E. :)\r\n\r\nIf you have the backside spool holder ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7105 ) installed you will need to move it elsewhere as one of the back feet colides with it.\r\n\r\nThe SketchUp file is included for others to tweak with it."
