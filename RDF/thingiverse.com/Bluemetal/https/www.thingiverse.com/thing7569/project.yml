function: I wanted to see my TOM doing its job and holding a flashlight got old pretty fast, so I decide to install LED lighting. I bought an adhesive backed cool white SMD LED strip at Amazon (I am sure there are cheaper alternatives out there but Amazon is "reasonable" and fast) ( http://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Lighting-LED-Ribbon-2026wh/dp/B002QQ1YOM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1301971588&sr=8-1 ) and its matching PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) dimming control ( http://www.amazon.com/Dimming-Controller-Lights-Ribbon-Volt/dp/B003L4KKF2/ref=pd_cp_hi_2 ).
