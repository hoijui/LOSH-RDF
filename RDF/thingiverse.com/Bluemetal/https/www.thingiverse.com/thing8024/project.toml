function = "Since I posted, I have tested PET bootle plastic and it will curl up at 120C. The search continues though, there maybe something out there that can be used as seamless belt! \r\n\r\nI have issues with the belts in my Automatic Build Platform. They start nicely but very soon they start bulging up at the seams and affect the shapes of the bottom on prints. In most cases is not that important but sometimes it really screws things up.\r\n\r\nThe belt is made from PET and so are most beverage bottles today. I thought one could find a bottle that has a clean cylindrical middle section (no grooves or reliefs) that was around 90 mm in diameter and make a seamless belt of the section.\r\n\r\nSo in order to start the quest for the perfect bootle (hopefully cheap) and not to be in a supermarket with a caliper (potentially puncturing bottles filled with liquids under pressure) I printed a gauge of sorts in my TOM.\r\n\r\nUpdated the STL file - the original had some 3d text that did not print well."
