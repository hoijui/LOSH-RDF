    okh:function """Inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8878 and until I get the ABP to do what it is supposed to do for all height prints, I have created a simple systems to switch between the two. It requires one more MBI heater board ( http://store.makerbot.com/makerbot-thingomatic-heater-board-v1-1.html ) so there is no dismantling necessary. \r
\r
The idea is to replace the X stage front and back plates with printed counterparts (one could use the wooden pieces but the removal would probably injure it eventually) and to install a pair of clips to the underside of the ABP and the HBP. \r
\r
The ABP will require 4 extra holes (exactly where the HBP has them) but otherwise the transformation is reversible (important to me).\r
\r
The HBP has 4 thumbscrews to adjust height in each corner and the ABP is being modified further to use a Stainless Stell belt as seen here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9127 along with a servo driven "tensioner" that tenses the standard length belt during printing so some more stable height gain can be obtained from the ABP but releases whenever the belt needs to moves. I will post this one when I am done building and testing it.\r
\r
I have added the SketchUp files for your editing pleasure.""" ;
