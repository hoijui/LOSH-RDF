function: I was bored one Sunday, and was looking for a quick project. I found plans for a putt putt boat and started making it. Part way through, I realized the milk carton I cut in to a boat shape was no longer waterproof. I later cut a boat shape out of an old protein bottle. Long story short, I wanted a boat like the putt putt boat directions, so I designed one.
