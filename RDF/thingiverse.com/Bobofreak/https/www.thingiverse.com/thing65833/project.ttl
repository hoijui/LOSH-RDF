\r
This is a modification of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29094 UP Temp Mod lid.\r
\r
While it did fit the Afinia H series the size must be different between the UP! and the Afinia or maybe there was a change with a newer build.\r
\r
I also found fitting the switch and wiring very tight so I have raised the entire cover to give more room for the switch, harnesses and wires.\r
\r
I have modified the tabs that lock in the cover to be much thicker with rounder nubs to snap in the top. I  have redimensioned it to fit my Afinia.\r
\r
Thanks - Scott""" ;
