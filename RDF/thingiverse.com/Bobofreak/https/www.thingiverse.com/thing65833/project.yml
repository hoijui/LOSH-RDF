function: "This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/404CWo2W9dK\r\n\r\nThis is a modification of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29094 UP Temp Mod lid.\r\n\r\nWhile it did fit the Afinia H series the size must be different between the UP! and the Afinia or maybe there was a change with a newer build.\r\n\r\nI also found fitting the switch and wiring very tight so I have raised the entire cover to give more room for the switch, harnesses and wires.\r\n\r\nI have modified the tabs that lock in the cover to be much thicker with rounder nubs to snap in the top. I  have redimensioned it to fit my Afinia.\r\n\r\nThanks - Scott"
