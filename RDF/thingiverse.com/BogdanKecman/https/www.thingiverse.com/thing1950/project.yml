function: "I own a rapman (bits from bytes laser cut reprap derivative) and looking at many designs I like the extruder this guys made very much. The extruder is divided in two parts (linked with 2 screws) - the \"drive\" part where a stepper driven shaft grab and push the filament - and the \"hot end\" part that is, well, melting the plastic.\r\n\r\nAfter many kg's of filament (abs, pp, hdpe, pla) trough the hot end from bfb I never had issues with it and as they sold hot end as a separate \"part\" I figure one can mount it to the Mendel using the pinch wheel drive and the bowden cable as the \"other part\" of the extruder assembly. This is a good idea but a hot end from bfb is ~40mm in dia hence I had to modify the carriage a bit (just drilled a big 40mm hole in them)."
