function = "eZ430-Chronos comes with 2 usb devices. One is TI eZ430U simulator that is basically ICSP + debugger and is used to program & debug the mcu in chronos and the other device is BlueRobin transceiver. Both are very small and look fragile and they both come \"naked\" hence I decided to box them. This is the case for the BlueRobin transceiver."
