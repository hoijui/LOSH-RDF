function = "eZ430-Chronos comes with 2 usb devices. One is TI eZ430U simulator that is basically ICSP + debugger and is used to program & debug the mcu in chronos and the other device is BlueRobin transceiver. Both are very small and look fragile and they both come \\\"naked\\\" hence I decided to box them. This is the case for the eZ430U debugger/programmer/simulator.\r\n\r\n(The case for BlueRobin is here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2057 )"
