function: "WHY: BFB hot ends are very robust and easily obtainable. BFB even sell them assembled and with various nozzle sizes. They are aluminium+peek+teflon so very strong hence you can use them not only for ABS and PLA but also for HDPE, LDPE, PP, uPVC and some other materials.\r\n\r\nWHAT: x-carriage has to be changed (to accommodate for the size of the bfb hot end) and the adapter has to be installed between extruder and xcarriage"
