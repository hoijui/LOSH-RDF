function: This is a ~45 mm square pendant of the Hylian crest with a hole for string. I haven't printed it yet but should have plastic in soon. It did slice well so I see no problems printing this. I also have this on shapeways so you can buy them in better materials and help feed my printer. http://www.shapeways.com/model/471629/
