function: "It is printed in red PLA with a mendel reprap. The slices are 0.2 mm to gain the details needed for printing in original size.\r\n\r\nFor that I just resized it to the size of standard lego (exactly factor 0.5). Because of the miniaturisation I had to change the hole for the clamp of the hips. Also I slightly increased the size of the arms for a better fit to the hands.\r\n\r\nI glued some nails into the arms and put them into the holes of the torso. Now you can also move the arms!\r\n\r\nFor a better fit to lego bricks I cut of two squares into the legs - now it can stand on lego :-)"
