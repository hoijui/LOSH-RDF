function = "This afternoon I was looking for some nice space shuttle to print. I found one here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1966 , but it seemed to be a bit to smooth.\r\nSo I googled a little and found some fitting object in the 3D galery. I resized it and repraired it using netfabb and after a short time I printed one with a length of about 105 mm.\r\nThe upper wing is a bit too thin to be printable precisely, but it is a little more detailed than the mentioned space shuttle.\r\n\r\nBut the real cool feature: It is glowing in the dark using phosphorescent PLA.\r\n\r\nThe model you can download here is scaled up to a length of 135 mm hoping that this size is big enough to print a better wing.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nBonsaiBrain\r\n\r\nMore about this and where to get the glowing in the dark PLA: www.ifeelbeta.de"
