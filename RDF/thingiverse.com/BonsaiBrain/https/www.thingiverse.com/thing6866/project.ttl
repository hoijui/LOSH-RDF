    okh:function """This afternoon I was looking for some nice space shuttle to print. I found one here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1966 , but it seemed to be a bit to smooth.\r
So I googled a little and found some fitting object in the 3D galery. I resized it and repraired it using netfabb and after a short time I printed one with a length of about 105 mm.\r
The upper wing is a bit too thin to be printable precisely, but it is a little more detailed than the mentioned space shuttle.\r
\r
But the real cool feature: It is glowing in the dark using phosphorescent PLA.\r
\r
The model you can download here is scaled up to a length of 135 mm hoping that this size is big enough to print a better wing.\r
