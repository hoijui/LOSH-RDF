function: "This is an experimental prototype enclosure for a miniature DC motor. It is designed to be used in harsh environments, however, due to no air circulation, the motor may get hot. I havent tested it for extended use or use in harsh environments yet.\r\n\r\nThe hole for the motor shaft will need to be drilled out to fit the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe cap was not designed to be removed once installed. Removing the cap may damage the case.\r\n\r\nMounting holes for two different mounting options are built in. A hole for the wires is also built in.\r\n\r\nI hope someone finds it useful."
