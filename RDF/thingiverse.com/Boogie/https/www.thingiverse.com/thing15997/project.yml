function: "I use pipettes a lot when building models and I hate getting them cross contaminated. This handly little holder helps by keeping the pipette with the bottle of solvent or whatever.\r\n\r\nPRINT USING PLA!!! The solvent (plastic cement, thinner, etc) will melt ABS but won't melt PLA.\r\n\r\nThe ring is a oversized slightly to fit over the label on the bottle. If your bottle doesn't have a label, you might need to add a layer of tape to the bottle to get this thing to stay on."
