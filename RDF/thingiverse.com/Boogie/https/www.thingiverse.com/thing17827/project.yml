function: "This thing basically holds your iphone in position with the microscope eyepiece. It allows you to turn your iphone into a digital camera/view screen for a binocular type microscope. Great for group viewings or capturing microscopic images with your iphone and microscope. Great tool for classrooms. The mount was designed specifically for the Edmund Scientific binocular type microscope. It slips right over the eye pieces. \r\n\r\nIf you don't have an iPhone, you can print just the base mount and use rubber bands to hold your phone/camera on."
