function = "Attention PMC jewelry makers!\r\n\r\nThis thing is a PMC ring former. Use it to form ring blanks out of PMC (Precious Metal Clay). Once the ring blank is formed, you can add detail to it or fire it as is.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe STL and DXF files are scaled for a size 7 ring blank. I do not know the finished size after firing. I'll try to remember to post the size after I finally fire one of these.\r\n\r\nRR1_C1 and RR1_C2 replace part RR1_C, making it easier to remove the PMC ring blank. Hold the two halves together with rubber bands until the PMC is dry."
