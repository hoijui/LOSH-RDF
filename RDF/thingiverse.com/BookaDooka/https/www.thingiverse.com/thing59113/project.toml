It does work, and makes switching filament easy for me.  \n\nUPDATE:  \nI had an idea to make the washers triangular so that they can both be printed at the same time ON the AO-101.  \ntwo washer spool.stl  \n\nor two with the lulzbot logo  \ntwo washer spool lulzbot.stl  \nfrom http://download.lulzbot.com/TAZ/hardware/printed_parts/electronics_enclosure/enclosure_top/enclosure_top-v1.1.STL"
