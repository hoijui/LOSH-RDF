function = "**Looking for PLA? We offer unmatched 1.75 PLA print quality with our [SP Series PLA](https://bootsindustries.com/).**\r\n\r\nWhile working on the Rostock BI edition we also tested different types of PLA filament spools. We found that when using spools with different inner diameters a versatile system is a must. We designed our spool holder to allow for a quick switch between many spool types. Our main design objectives were stability, reliability and versatility.  \r\n\r\nFollow us on twitter for updates [@BootsIndustries](https://twitter.com/BootsIndustries)\r\n\r\nThe spool holder is comprised of three main parts:  \r\n\r\n1) The spool holder base   \r\n\r\n2) The rotating platform   \r\n\r\n3) The spool adaptor   \r\n\r\nThe key to our design is that you can modify and print several spool adaptors that match the types of spools you have on hand. Everything is held in place by gravity with the rotating platform connecting to the spool adaptor."
