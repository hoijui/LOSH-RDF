\r
While working on the Rostock BI edition we also tested different types of PLA filament spools. We found that when using spools with different inner diameters a versatile system is a must. We designed our spool holder to allow for a quick switch between many spool types. Our main design objectives were stability, reliability and versatility.  \r
\r

\r
The spool holder is comprised of three main parts:  \r
\r
1) The spool holder base   \r
\r
2) The rotating platform   \r
\r
3) The spool adaptor   \r
\r
The key to our design is that you can modify and print several spool adaptors that match the types of spools you have on hand. Everything is held in place by gravity with the rotating platform connecting to the spool adaptor.""" ;
