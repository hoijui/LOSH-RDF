function: "Inspired by TwoTimes awesome wobble arrester, \r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2151\r\n\r\nYou will need to purchase the vertical rails and bushings listed in the wobble arrester materials list.\r\n\r\nThe design captures the Z-axis nut, have a smooth base which can slide smoothly under the acrylic and have a vertical pin to prevent rotation.  it is all very simple and makes a huge difference in the smoothness of your prints because it removes the wobble from the rotating z-shafts.\r\n\r\nI also printed a simple triangle to capture the z-rails, but the ones in the wobble arrester is far cooler."
