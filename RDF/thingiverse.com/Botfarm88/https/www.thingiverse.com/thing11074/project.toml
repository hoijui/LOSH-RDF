function = "This is a collection of the entire human spinal column. I have used netfabb to slice each of the vertebres in half so that they can be printed out and then glued together. I am trying to complete the entire human body. I have scaled these to be slightly larger than the normal human size to increase the accuracy of the print. I will soon be adding the left hand.
