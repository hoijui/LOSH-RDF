function = "This project is an FPV mount system to fit a Fat Shark camera and transmitter into the cockpit space of an FPVRaptor from HobbyKing.\r\nBefore we go too far I will say that this is NOT a tracking mount.  It has a pivot in it so that the vertical alignment can be set up by the pilot to suit their desired view.  The camera mount is designed to slot into the hole where a servo would go for a tracking camera mount.  The transmitter holder is designed to be glued and taped down to the deck behind the camera."
