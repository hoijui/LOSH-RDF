function = "This is a cover/enclosure for a standard 16x2 HD44780 LCD Module, such as this one: http://www.adafruit.com/products/181.    These 16x2 LCD Modules are great for various projects and come in a variety of display colors.\r\n\r\nI needed one for the LCD display on my Ultimaker, so I designed this one using Alibre Design.    It even has an handy extra cutout in the side to accommodate a potentiometer for controlling the LCD display contrast."
