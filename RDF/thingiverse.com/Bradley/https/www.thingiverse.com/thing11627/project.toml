function = "This is a mod on Martijn's excellent Ultimaker Robot keychain.\r\n\r\nI wanted something bigger and easier/faster to print (30 minutes, no support needed), so this is what I came up with.   \r\n\r\nIt turns out, this model is the exact size of the Robot laser engraving on the front of the Ultimaker!  Thus, if you print it, you'll have an awesome hood ornament for your fabulous Ultimaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis cute little guy is a great keepsake for everyone.  No doubt I'll be printing them at Maker Faire.  Stop by and pick one up!"
