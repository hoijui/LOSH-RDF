function: "This is a universal base for the Rigel Astronomy QuickFinder.   It is specifically made to fit firmly on a ADM Accessories Mini Dovetail System (MDS) Plate Adapter, but it may easily be used or modified for a variety of other mounts.   The key advantage here is that the design contains all the recessed slots needed so the finder \"clicks-in\" easily and holds securely. \r\n\r\nTwo versions are provided to correspond with the desired orientation of the MDS plate adapter mounting hole.  Otherwise, the versions are the same.\r\n\r\nI designed this in Alibre Design."
