function = "This is a simple small parts tray.   I needed one for holding small screws, etc when I disassemble a device.  I searched Thingiverse for one, but didn't find one, so I designed this one.\r\n\r\nThis is my very first 3D design.  I used Alibre Design to do it.  \r\n\r\nIt's very cool to design something (simple or otherwise) from thin air and, a couple of minutes later, be holding it in your hand!"
