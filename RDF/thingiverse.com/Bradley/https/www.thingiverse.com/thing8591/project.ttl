Since my 3D design skills are getting better, I decided to make a solution to misplacing parts when doing maintenance on my 3D Printer.\r
\r
It's sturdy enough to take abuse, deep enough to hold those 16mm bolts, yet small enough to keep out of the way of the printing mechanism.   Plus it has a nice 5mm wide clip so you can attach it on any horizontal edge of your printer's enclosure.    I designed it in Alibre Design.""" ;
