function = "Being attached to a print facility we cut a lot of paper and board and are always looking for ways to improve the cuts, reduce ashing etc. We have tried honeycomb, frames, backings etc and decided to try a DIY pin table. We are really pleased with the results and the cuts we are getting are excellent. The next version will have vent holes added. The height of the side panels is defined purely by what size screws we had to hand. (FYI - SRA4 is a printers oversize paper size of 320x225mm)"
