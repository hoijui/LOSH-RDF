function: "This is a personal jet powered aircraft with boosters on the side that can rotate to lift and powered the aircraft forward or side to side. \r\n\r\nI don't own a printer but I have 3D printed projects before on commercial machines but not on a personal desktop printer. So I was a bit unsure of the limitations. I think that all the components should print with minimum difficulty and support material.\r\n\r\nAssembled Dimensions: \r\n(L) 102mm x (W) 128mm x (H) 79mm\r\n\r\nEnjoy"
