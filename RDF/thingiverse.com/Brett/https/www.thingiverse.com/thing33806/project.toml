function = "A long time ago I had broken and failed to replace the light bulb cover (it's not a shade... I'm not sure what to call it) on a ceiling fan in the house.\r\n\r\nSick of staring at a bare bulb - I decided I could print a replacement.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest volume print I've made to date (printerbot plus).  It took five and a half hours to print, but I'm happy with the look.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinished and mounted - I really like the way the light passes through the PLA - I think it's better looking than the original glass.  I may replace the others in the house."
