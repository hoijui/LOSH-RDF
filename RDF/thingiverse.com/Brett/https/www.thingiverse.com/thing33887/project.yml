function: "This is a replacement for an old, poorly designed and difficult to source cabinet lock used on a friends boat.\r\n\r\nThe originals were difficult to find locally, and to order them from the manufacturer was ridiculously expensive.\r\n\r\nHopefully these may save someone some time and trouble."
