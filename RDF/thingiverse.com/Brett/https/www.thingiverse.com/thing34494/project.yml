function: "Drying Rack for Kitchen Sponges.\r\n\r\nOk - so didn't amaze the wife with this one either - but I still like it... it's better then having the things just laying there.\r\n\r\nYeah, sponges are cheap - and you can just microwave them, or throw them out - but then how could I justify this 3d printer and the countless hours cursing my horrible design skills?"
