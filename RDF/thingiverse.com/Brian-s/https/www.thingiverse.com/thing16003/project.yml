function: On the Emaker Huxley the Igus bushes that run on the Z rods are held in by a self tapping screw and washer. I noticed that mine were pulling out of the holder on the opposite side from the screw. I thought there must be a better way to hold them in. I used Openscad to cut the top 3mm off of the X axis idler bracket and screwed it on the outside of the igus bush. Job done.
