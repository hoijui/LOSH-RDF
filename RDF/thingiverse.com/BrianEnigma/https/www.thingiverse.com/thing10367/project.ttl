\r
Based on the popularity of the octopus model here on Thingiverse and the popularity of GitHub among programmers, I figured I would try making a creepy version of GitHub's octocat.\r
\r
This model is a frankenstein mashup between Bucket o' Octopi http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7900 and The Cat http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1283\r
\r
Change Log:\r
\r
Version 2 of this model is the latest and fixes the flat areas found in version 1.\r
\r
Version 1 of this model has a couple of flat areas in the cat's head.  This is entirely due to my Blender skills and a big mistake that occurred early in the process, but wasn't caught until late.  It's not noticeable at MakerBot resolutions, but if you were to print this on a fancy professional printer, I'd wait until the next version.  There's also a minor problem with the cat's chin being just a bit too much of an overhang for a MakerBot to handle perfectly, but it still looks good after you cut away some of the slop/drool.""" ;
