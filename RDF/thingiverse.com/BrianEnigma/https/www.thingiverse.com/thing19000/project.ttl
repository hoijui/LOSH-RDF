    okh:function """About a year ago, I uploaded the plastic version of a "wooden nickel."  You can still find it here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6579  It was a simple coin with cut-out text.  Today I updated the design for dualstrusion.  Instead of the text being a cut-out, it is a fused-in second color.  All the same stuff I said about the old nickel still applies:\r
\r
This isn't a wooden nickel, but a plastic one. It's fun for "don't take any wooden nickel" jokes, children old enough to not choke on it, and poker buddies sober enough to not choke on it. It measures 40mm across and is 4mm thick along the rim and 3mm thick in the body. The attached photo shows the plastic nickel next to an actual nickel for comparison.\r
\r
This was designed in OpenSCAD, using a PostScript file (converted to DXF) for the text. The source zip includes the OpenSCAD source, the EPS, and the DXF.""" ;
