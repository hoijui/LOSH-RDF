\r
Many modern shampoo bottles have a flat top that allows you to set it down top-side-down.  Unfortunately, the brand of all-natural crunchy-granola urban-hippy shampoo that I use does not have such a top.  I either cannot get to the last little bit of shampoo or I have to do something creative with the bottle: balance it, wedge it against something, or do a quick centrifuge-style flick of the bottle.  None of these work all that well in the dim, pre-coffee hours of the morning.\r
\r
I then decided to take matters into my own hands and design a shampoo caddy to hold my shampoo and conditioner upside-down.  The main features are cylindrical holes to hold each bottle and a wide, flat base to help keep everything upright.  At the bottom of each bottle-gripping cylinder is a draining hole that links up with a draining trough running to the front of the caddy.  \r
\r
The whole thing works pretty well and can be reconfigured to your brand (and more specifically, geometry) of shampoo.""" ;
