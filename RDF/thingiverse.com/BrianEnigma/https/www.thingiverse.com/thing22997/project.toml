function = "Do you like to play games with dice? Do you find yourself unannoyed with QR codes? Then we have the dice for you! Until you memorize which pattern is which digit, this is guaranteed to require a cameraphone to decode what number you rolled!\r\n\r\nThis is an update of the original Useless Dice model ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22986 ).  Instead of using an image editing program to turn QR code pictures into 2D vectors to extrude (which had extremely bad results), this variant uses a Ruby script to generate the QR code pattern for each face, then writes out OpenSCAD files that build up each face from geometric primitives.  For those interested in the messy details, the Ruby script is part of the source zip file."
