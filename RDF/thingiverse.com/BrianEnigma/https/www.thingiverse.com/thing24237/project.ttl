\r
 - Rotated and translated to be on the build platform\r
 - Multiplied size by 3 to be a bit more reasonable (though you may want to increase it more)\r
 - In Blender, extruded, then chopped flat the base to normalize the concave holes and convex bumps\r
\r
Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done about the chin overhang.  You're likely to get some droopy plastic there.  Some diagonal clippers and a set of hobby files will help a bit.""" ;
