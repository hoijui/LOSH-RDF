    okh:function """This is a model of the WOPR computer from War Games. The model was manually reconstructed by watching the same 39 seconds of the film over and over again. I took a few liberties in the rebuild. \r
\r
(1) The recessed hatches and/or the overall length are not quite to scale (there actually should be a group of four rivets after the pair of panels). \r
\r
(2) The real movie prop has a bit of an overhang at the floor, whereas I made the sides go straight down to the floor for easier MakerBot and RepRap printing. \r
\r
(3) I made no attempt to model das blinkenlights. \r
\r
(4) I only reproduced the large text. \r
\r
(5) There may be an Easter Egg inside the hollow base for fans of TRON.\r
\r
