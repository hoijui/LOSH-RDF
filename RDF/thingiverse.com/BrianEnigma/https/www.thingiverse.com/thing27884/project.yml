function: "This is a model of the WOPR computer from War Games. The model was manually reconstructed by watching the same 39 seconds of the film over and over again. I took a few liberties in the rebuild. \r\n\r\n(1) The recessed hatches and/or the overall length are not quite to scale (there actually should be a group of four rivets after the pair of panels). \r\n\r\n(2) The real movie prop has a bit of an overhang at the floor, whereas I made the sides go straight down to the floor for easier MakerBot and RepRap printing. \r\n\r\n(3) I made no attempt to model das blinkenlights. \r\n\r\n(4) I only reproduced the large text. \r\n\r\n(5) There may be an Easter Egg inside the hollow base for fans of TRON.\r\n\r\nSlightly more detail on my blog: http://netninja.com/2012/08/03/is-that-a-wopr-in-your-pocket/"
