function: "I take a lot of notes on index cards and in pocket notebooks.  This little index card \"bleacher\" gives me a place on the desk to display my current to-do list as well as an organizer for blank cards, completed cards, notebooks, and whatnot.\r\n\r\nThe parametric OpenSCAD source file is attached, in case you want to make simple tweaks to the design measurements.  The constants are all up at the top of the file."
