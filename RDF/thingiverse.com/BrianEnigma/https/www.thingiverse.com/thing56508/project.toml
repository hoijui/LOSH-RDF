function = "In an effort to feed the cats consistent amounts, without overfeeding, I needed a 1/4-cup measuring cup.  It felt silly to buy a whole pack of measuring cups just for the one, especially with a Replicator in the other room.  I decided to design a measuring cup, instead.  And while I was doing the math for the quarter-cup variant, it's easy enough to parameterize for other sizes.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and pick one of the predefined sizes (from 1/8 cup to 1 cup, in 1/8-cup increments) or pick \"Custom\" and enter some number of milliliters for anything in between.\r\n\r\nThe design of each cup is such that the cup's width and height are equal.  This better facilitates nesting them within one another, though the actual nestability is ultimately based on which sizes you have and how thick you make the wall.\r\n\r\nThis is version 2 of the measuring cup (though the first public release).  The original quarter-cup model had been in use for about a year until the handle broke.  This version has a thicker, more stylized, handle plus added strain relief.\r\n\r\nMore information on my blog at: http://netninja.com/2013/03/02/choose-your-own-measuring-cup/ â€Ž"
