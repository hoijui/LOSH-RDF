function: "This isn't a wooden nickel, but a plastic one.  It's fun for \"don't take any wooden nickel\" jokes, children old enough to not choke on it, and poker buddies sober enough to not choke on it.  It measures 40mm across and is 4mm thick.  The attached photos show just the nickel as well as one next to a penny for comparison.  Ironically, I do not have an actual nickel right now!\r\n\r\nThe Rev. B version has a greatly improved cent-sign.\r\n\r\nThis was designed in OpenSCAD, using a PostScript file (converted to DXF) for the text.  The source zip includes the OpenSCAD source, the EPS, and the DXF of both the original version and Revision B."
