function = "I have a friend who wanted a regular pentagon template for cutting fabric.  She wanted lots of copies of the same pentagon shape but was worried that a standard cardstock or cardboard template would get eroded over time by the rotary cutter.  This pentagon comes in two main pieces (each printable on a Replicator) plus a handle and should be able to withstand a good amount of abuse.\r\n\r\nMaybe kids can use this for tracing and art projects, but beyond that, it may be of limited utility to most folks.\r\n\r\nOpenSCAD source files are in the zip."
