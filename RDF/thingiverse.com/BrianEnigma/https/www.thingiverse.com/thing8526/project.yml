function: "This is a tablespoon and teaspoon, suitable for printing and using.\r\n\r\nThe source file is an OpenSCAD document for outputting a measuring spoon of any desired volume.  The measuring spoon consists of a scoop (a half-sphere of desired radius and thickness) connected to a handle (with desired length  and thickness).  All of these parameters are variables that can be fine tuned to your desire.\r\n\r\nIf you have never used OpenSCAD before, this is a simple and highly-commented first taste of its usefulness and flexibility."
