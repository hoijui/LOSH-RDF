function = "Thanks to sconine for his Mechanical Animals thing:11980 I made a few changes to his dolphin i.e. I redesigned the stand in two parts to enable flat printing and better holes and made detachable waves so you can print them in different colors. I also reshaped the dolphin to make it look more rounded and it is a bit bigger, unfortunately this accentuates the print layers."
