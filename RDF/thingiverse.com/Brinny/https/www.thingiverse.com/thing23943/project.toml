function = "This wind barrier for the UP! 3D printer has a switch to open and close the vents that were introduced on V7 to blow cool air across the nozzle to enable better support and raft removal. This lead to a slightly weaker bond between the layers and some de-lamination on larger prints.  Now you can switch i.e. cover these vents when not needed."
