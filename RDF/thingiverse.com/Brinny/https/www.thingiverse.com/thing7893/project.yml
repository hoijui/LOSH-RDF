function: "My new 3D printer (from 3dprintingsystems.com) is going flat out and here is my latest job.\r\nWhen I was a young guy...........yeah years ago I remember having an old piston and conrod sitting on my desk that I used as a desk tidy.......so I though lets print one.\r\nI made it all up, sizes etc from google images of the parts and produced the files in Solidworks.\r\nI even got carried away and made some rings..........the oil scrapping ring is very thin hence the few bits of support to be cleaned off that you can see in the photo.\r\nI have laid the rings one on top of the other with a very small gap between..........this allows you to peel them off one another after printing.\r\nWould be nice in a grey color with a bit of oil or grease stain to finish it off.  Have fun!!"
