\r
I created two link types: one with a "top" crossmember, and one with a "bottom crossmember. (The .STLs both look like they only have a bottom, but the top is flipped over so that it'll print)\r
\r
If this works, maybe Landru will implement it in any updates he does. I probably won't update this myself, but wanted to upload my edits so I could find them easily, and for others to try.""" ;
