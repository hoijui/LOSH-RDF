function: "These are the same as Landru's links, but you can attach these to existing cables. I already have connectors on the ends of my cables so i won't be able to use his design as-is, and you might have the same problem.\r\n\r\nI created two link types: one with a \"top\" crossmember, and one with a \"bottom crossmember. (The .STLs both look like they only have a bottom, but the top is flipped over so that it'll print)\r\n\r\nIf this works, maybe Landru will implement it in any updates he does. I probably won't update this myself, but wanted to upload my edits so I could find them easily, and for others to try."
