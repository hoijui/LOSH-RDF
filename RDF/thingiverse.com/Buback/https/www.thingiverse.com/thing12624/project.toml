function = "Collimate your telescope easily with a laser pointer. \r\n\r\nBasic idea is you put a laser pointer in one end, it bounces off the secondary mirror and hits the center of the primary mirror. The beam then reflects off the primary mirror back up to the eyepiece. When properly collimated, the laser should bounce right back into the laser pointer hole.\r\n\r\nThe eyepiece size is 1.25\"\r\n\r\nHere's a video showing how to use a commercial version.\r\nhttp://youtu.be/N1asF3m2Mh0\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a test. I'm not sure a 3d printed version will be accurate enough to properly collimate a telescope. I think it will also depend on the accuracy of cheap laser pointers."
