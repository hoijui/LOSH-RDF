function = "This thing allows you to precisely position and align the 45 degree secondary mirror on a Newtonian telescope.\r\n\r\nIt is designed around a 1 inch (minor axis) mirror, but you could conceivably use a much larger mirror.\r\n\r\nThe facets on the mirror holder sides make it easy to adjust it's alignment \r\n\r\nNov 4 '11- I updated the files for three changes\r\n- There are now niches for M3 nuts for the collimation screws.\r\n- The main M4 screw now has a conical hole on the angled part, so the part can now pivot, to a limited degree.\r\n- Took a chunk off the top of the angles part. Speeds up printing, and makes for better prints."
