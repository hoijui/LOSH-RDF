function = "Do you want to learn which sky-dots are planets and which are stars? Want to see the stars before light pollution renders our sky a off-black void? Have a 3d printer? Great!   \n\nYou too can enjoy the hobby of **Astronomy!** Stay up way later than your bedtime! Stand in the cold and dark! Collimation!  \n\n--  \nSeriously it's actually pretty fun. Just don't expect anything as good as Hubble. As a mater of fact, you can see just about every heavenly body better just by looking it up on the internet.   \n\nBut that's not what it's about at all. Looking at your computer monitor, you don't get that feeling of standing on a ball hurtling through space. And the unadulterated light from Jupiter, having traveled hundreds of millions of miles just to fall upon your retina, is like a draught of fresh mountain spring water. It's a very meditative, contemplative hobby."
