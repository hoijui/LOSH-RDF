\r
They are basically like flat washers that prevent the m3 nut from spinning or slipping through the channel opening. If you want a stronger solution, use m3 fender washers in conjunction with this part. I recommend printing the trunk of the T on the part itself, which will align the part with the channel and keep the holes centered""" ;
