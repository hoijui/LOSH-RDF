function = "This part holds the wires in the channel of a 20x20 aluminum extrusion.

This is something i've adapted from an old typeface technique known as an ink trap. In printing, it is used to keep crisp edges in corners. The technique seems to work well for 3d printing.   \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_trap"
