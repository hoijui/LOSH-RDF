function: "This part holds the wires in the channel of a 20x20 aluminum extrusion. They are small and print quickly so you can print lots of them to keep all those wires organized.  \n\nYou might notice that the corners have little cut-outs. This is something i've adapted from an old typeface technique known as an ink trap. In printing, it is used to keep crisp edges in corners. The technique seems to work well for 3d printing.   \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_trap"
