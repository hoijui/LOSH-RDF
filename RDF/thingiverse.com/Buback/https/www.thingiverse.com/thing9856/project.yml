function: "Art framing can be ridiculously expensive. However, a good framing job makes the artwork look much, much better. With that in mind, I want to try printing a frame for a (art) print I bought. \r\n\r\nThis is basic example of an art frame that can be printed on a 3d printer. Many different profiles can be made to suit many different types of art, but I just mocked up a quick one as an example of the basic principle."
