    okh:function """When I received my RAPMAN 3.1 and finished the assembly of the machine it was apparent that the mounting of the ELECTRONICS PACKAGE was horrible. Mounting it on the bottom front of the machine left it open to potential problems and in my case liquids, such as soda and drinks are always on my workbench.  \r
 \r
The idea was to mount the Electronics in a BOX which was to be mounted to the vertical support of the machine and pivot able to allow me to see the controls when I am working from my computer station.  \r
 \r
This design is a work in progress and as such I will be updating it in the near future. USE PLA as warpage in ABS is a problem.  \r
 \r
I am a degreed Mechanical Engineer, who started his working life as a journeyman "TOOL & DIE MAKER". I retired as General Manager of an AeroSpace machine shop and an instructor in AUTOCAD, CNC Programing, and Apprentice training. If this is boasting let me say I have lived almost 7 decades and am proud of the knowledge I have gained and shared with others.  \r
 \r
The cover is the next step once I lengthen some wires that I cut to short. Once it is done I will add the cover. \r
