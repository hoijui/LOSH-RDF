function = "A copy of the Cold Steel Delta Dart, as seen below.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.coldsteel.com/Product/92DD/DELTA_DART.aspx\r\n\r\nMy design is a shorter version made to fit on the print bed of a Makerbot Replicator.  The Delta Dart is ribbed for purpose of maintaining grip.  Ribless version also available.  Hole on back is for a keychain ring or cord.  Pictures don't show it well, but blade is triangular."
