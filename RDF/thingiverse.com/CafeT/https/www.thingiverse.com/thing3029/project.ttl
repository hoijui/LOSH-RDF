    okh:function """In line with my desire for a 3D printer like the CupCake that uses conductive build material, here is a printable resistor. This one has 0.05 mm traces (or scale it until it does) and many more turns than http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2967 does, so it should provide much higher resistance (calculation, anyone?). The script could generate other trace sizes and numbers of turns, and I will modify it to do capacitors as well as possibly release it at some point. Made in Python, Inkscape, and Blender.\r

Update: Using an Archimedean spiral approximation, I think this would be about 1.33 ohms in copper, 86.9 ohms in nichrome, 17.4 ohms in lead, 1.65 megaohms in sea water. I imagine this could be raised quite significantly if one could print the resistor in layers along the Z axis (at the same resolution and trace size, 10 times per millimeter).""" ;
