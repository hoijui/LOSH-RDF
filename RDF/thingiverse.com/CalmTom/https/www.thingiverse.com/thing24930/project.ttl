About Me:  I'm on a mission to create all sorts of items that are embarrassing to buy in person, I currently sell all sorts of such items through my company PriveCo, but I think that making these types of items at home is even more private.  I'm creating a bunch of designs and I'm going to put them at my website MakerLove.com.  \r
\r
If you are a skilled 3D designer, I hope you will join me in making interesting things.""" ;
