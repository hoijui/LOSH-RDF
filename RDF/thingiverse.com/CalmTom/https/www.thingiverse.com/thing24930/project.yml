function: "This is a backrub thing.  You can print it out and then try to find someone to give you a backrub with it.  Or if you are feeling generous, you can print it out and use it to give someone else a backrub!  Either way, it is a fun thing to print and use.\r\n\r\nAbout Me:  I'm on a mission to create all sorts of items that are embarrassing to buy in person, I currently sell all sorts of such items through my company PriveCo, but I think that making these types of items at home is even more private.  I'm creating a bunch of designs and I'm going to put them at my website MakerLove.com.  \r\n\r\nIf you are a skilled 3D designer, I hope you will join me in making interesting things."
