function: "Not tall enough?  Here are some shoe lifts that you can print out and then put in your shoes.  You'll instantly look taller.  If shoe lifts are good enough for Tom Cruise, they are good enough for Makers.  \r\n\r\nShoe lifts were once popular in the back of men's magazines \"Look Taller Instantly\".  Now you can print them at will and you will never come up \"short\" again.  \r\n\r\nThe default design is shaped to fit in the heel of a man's shoe and give you and extra 1/2 inch or so, but you can scale the design if you wish and get taller or put them in a shoe that is smaller.  \r\n\r\nIn the photos, you can see my daughter who stands 41 1/2 inches tall.  To a kid, this means she is 1/2 inch too short to ride most of the rides at the carnival or disneyworld.  \r\n\r\nWorry no longer, kiddo, with my Makerbot I saved the day.  I printer her out some shoe lifts and now she can bother her brothers with all of the thrill-ride screams that anyone can handle."
