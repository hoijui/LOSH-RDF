function: "This design for a better back scratcher is easy to print and assemble.  \r\n\r\nBuilding a better back scratcher seems like it would be easy, and I thought it would be.  Unfortunately, I am really picky about my back scratchers AND my back was quite itchy.  \r\n\r\nThis back scratcher was my 7th iteration and I think it is pretty darned good.  I hope you enjoy printing and using it."
