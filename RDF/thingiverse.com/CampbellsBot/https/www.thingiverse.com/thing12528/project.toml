function = "I liked tomlombardi's Y-Axis support bracket a lot. Printed it out and it worked as advertised. Only I had another unrelated problem where the wires from my ABP would rub and catch on the same bolts used to attach this thing. I decided to modify this part to avoid any future issue with the wires rubbing too much or potentially stripping.\r\n\r\nSo I upgraded this part by fully recessing the nuts by making the part a little thicker. The holes are also large enough to not need any drilling, and you can also use the same bolts that were originally used - longer bolts are not needed. I also created a large radius on the right side to allow the problematic wires to freely slide over this area without catching."
