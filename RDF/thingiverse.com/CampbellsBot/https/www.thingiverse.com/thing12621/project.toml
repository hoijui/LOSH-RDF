function = "This is a modification and upgrade on the few derivatives of emmett's bearing retainer, such as johnboiles'. Like some others, I too wanted to have as much visibility to the plunger/bearing/filament feed area. This is for the MK5/MK6/MK6+ stepper acrylic face.\r\n\r\nSo I trimmed as much material I could off the original design while keeping it rigid. Included the standoffs from johnboiles' design. \r\n\r\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!\r\n\r\nLike some others I had the problem where the plunger screw keeps loosening and ruining my prints. Due to the filament being forced in forward and reverse rapidly for certain prints, it would result in the plunger screw becoming loose and the filament would stop extruding. I would have to go to town with kapton tape everywhere trying to keep that screw in place! I couldn't trust my printer for long periods of time without checking on it periodically.\r\n\r\nBut everything is included in one part! So this part includes an arm that slides into the plunger screw area and fits snug around the screw shaft so it no longer loosens! Yeah! Save my kapton tape for more important uses now.\r\n\r\nDue to the tight tolerances in the plunger screw area, the hole may not print perfectly. Just grab some tweezers or an X-Acto blade and remove any extruded plastic that gets in the way. The plunger screw should insert fairly easily - you may need to use pliers to hold onto the screw as you rotate it in for the first time or your fingers might be raw after. I would suggest test inserting the plunger screw before bolting it onto the extruder so its easier once its actually installed.\r\n\r\nNEW IN VERSION 7!! (Took me 4 more revisions to get it juuuust right)\r\nNew and improved, this part adds additional support area where the plunger screw is inserted and more viewing area. New steps for v7 include removing the two nuts and bolts that are intended to hold the plunger nut in place. Since the adapter blocks the nut from falling out, these bolts aren't needed and allowed me to place in additional plunger screw support. Enjoy!"
