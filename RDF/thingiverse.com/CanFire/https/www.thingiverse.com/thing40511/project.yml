function: "This is a derivative of the table stand Cello-ch published for the DSO Quad.  I really liked how the design broke down for portability.\r\n\r\nThe only piece that I re-designed was the middle piece.  I re-positioned where the side parts join so they don't interfere with the buttons on the physically smaller Nano.  I also added small nubs to keep the Nano from sliding side-to-side while in the stand.\r\n\r\nFunctionality-wise, I believe my version works just as well for the Nano as the original no doubt does for the Quad.  The text that reads \"DSO Nano\" however didn't turn out as clean on my derivative as when I printed Cello-ch's original piece."
