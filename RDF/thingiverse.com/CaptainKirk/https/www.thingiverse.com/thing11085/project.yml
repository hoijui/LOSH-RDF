function: "Did you ever use a public restroom and the gap between the stall door and frame was so wide the door wouldn't latch and you have to use a hand or foot  to try to holding the door closed?\r\n\r\nSlip this between the door and frame and rest in peace.\r\n\r\nMost doors (at least in the U.S.) are one inch thick, which is what this is designed for."
