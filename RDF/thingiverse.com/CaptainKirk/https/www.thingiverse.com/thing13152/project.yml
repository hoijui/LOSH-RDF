function: "This is a latching hemostat.  It works, but I wouldn't use it for medical purposes. :-)\r\n\r\nOffset the handles a bit to unlatch.\r\n\r\nIt's based on a design by the former ICI Ltd. whose patent has expired.\r\n\r\nMakes a handy clamp for small things.  Yet another chip clip?  You could modify it so the jaws close to a fixed opening if you're holding things together for gluing... \r\n\r\nBecause of the nature of the plastic (I used ABS) the hinge has a limited life.  I kept flexing one until it broke, about 70 flexes.  When it breaks, print another."
