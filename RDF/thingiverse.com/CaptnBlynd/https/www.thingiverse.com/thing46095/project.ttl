This is a version of a multi-connector creator designed for use with Makerbot Customizer. Customizer will generate a connector for any number or rods at any angle (nearly) of any size with any thickness.  This thing will continue to be added to and improved until the  dead-line. I would like to give you individual arm parameters.\r
UPDATE*** You now have individual placement of any angle for up to 30 arms!!!\r
UPDATE*** I have now added a sample STL made with customizer to the downloads. \r
UPDATE*** 2.1 now generates connectors for Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Octogon, Circle. The back edge of the join is a bit rough on most except the circle but I am constantly improving this thing.\r
\r
UPDATE*** I have added a heel to clean-up the back of the join.""" ;
