function = "This is a Wallace/PrintRbot style 3D printer I designed for quick, multiple builds for a classroom type setting. I have named it the mini-minion because every mad scientist needs a minion. I asked my local community education center if they would consider teaching 3D printing and associated technologies because I wanted to learn more. Somehow, now I'm teaching 3D printing and associated technologies at my local community education center. I have constructed 3 of these frames and completed 1 of these printers already so the files should be solid. \r\n\r\nQUICK UP-DATE:\r\nThis printer is still in use today. It has been to classrooms, county fairs and seminars. All together, I use this one more than my Prusa. This has proven to be a rugged little printer."
