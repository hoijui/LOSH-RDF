function: "This is a bracket to attach a 40mm fan to Jonas' Reinforced Prusa X Carriage with Slim LM8UU Holder ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18657 ), which has a stub on either end to attach accessories.  \r\n\r\nI built my printer two weeks ago, and this is the first thing of my own design I printed on it.  I probably made a stupid mistake... just let me know.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's mostly parametric.  If you plug in dimensions for a larger fan, it should all scale... but it won't fit between the axis rails.  But you could easily adapt it to something else."
