function: This is a completely unnecessary re-invention of the wheel! (for wheel read traditional 6-sided die) It is doubtful that it will work in an 'unloaded' way and is not intended to replace dice. It's main purpose is to establish a simple model so I can find out a bit more about 3D printing from as 'hands-on' a point of view I can.
