    okh:function """The Sous Vide rig described in Make: 25 http://makezine.com/25/sousvide mounts the immersion heaters permanently to the bottom of the control box, and then the whole works sits up on top of the water bath. Many have built modular versions, with an outlet on the control box to power immersion heaters, or some other heat source. This Thing is designed to mount three immersion heaters atop the ceramic insert (crock?) of my oval shaped Crock Pot. I split it into two pieces for printing on my Ultimaker. \r
\r
This first print was intended to be a prototype, but it works fine for now. The attached Solidworks 2011 file and STL files are updated with a couple of fixes that I would implement if I made it again. Most notably, when I split the part in half, I gave the split line a width of 1mm so there will (theoretically) be some clearance between the two halves when they come together. But I'll probably redesign it completely before printing again, with the heaters in more of a triangular arrangement. And/or perhaps for a larger bath, bucket, or something like that.\r
\r
This was designed for the "Crock-Pot SCVT650-PS 6-1/2-Quart Programmable Touch Screen Slow Cooker" that I already own.""" ;
