function = "This is a 3D print derived from medical imaging of an aortic bifurcation and iliac arteries. The source data set is publicly available in the OsiriX DICOM library http://pubimage.hcuge.ch:8080/ . It is a CT scan from a patient that appears to have had one or more iliac stents placed in their right iliac artery. The workflow used to create this Thing was (almost) completely open source:\r\n\r\nAMNESIX Data set: http://pubimage.hcuge.ch:8080/DATA/AMNESIX.zip\r\n\r\nOsiriX used for segmentation and rough STL export: http://www.osirix-viewer.com/\r\n\r\nMeshlab used for cleanup: http://www.meshlab.org/\r\n\r\nFinal cleanup, slicing, and GCode using Netfabb  (http://netfabb.com), which is a bit faster than the open source alternatives. \r\n\r\nPrinted with RepG on an Ultimaker. Using the Netfabb \"standard\" profile (modified to print at 230 degrees) the full print took 4 hours and 19 minutes.\r\n\r\nMore on the story of this model: http://craig.bonsignore.com/2012/01/17/open-source-human-anatomy/"
