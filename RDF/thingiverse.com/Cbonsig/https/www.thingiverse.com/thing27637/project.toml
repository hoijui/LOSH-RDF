function = "Coupler that fits inside PVC (or whatever) pipe. Half a coupler, actually, so it can be easily printed and then glued together. This one is designed for a slip fit within 3/4\" Schedule 40 pipe, and it has a thin raft-like flange around the perimeter to minimize warping. Dimensions are easily adjusted using variables in the OpenSCAD file."
