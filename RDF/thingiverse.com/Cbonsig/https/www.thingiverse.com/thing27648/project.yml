function: 4-way coupler for connecting PVC pipe. This one is designed for a slip fit over 3/4 inch schedule 40 PVC pipe, but its parametric so it can be adjusted to join any size pipe. Though you can't see it in the preview, there's a little ledge inside that will stop the pipes from sliding through or colliding inside the coupler. Its chopped in half for easy printing. I've also added some pads to help the part stick to a cold platform, and counteract the tenancy for warping which makes gluing them together more difficult.
