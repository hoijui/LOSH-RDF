function = "This is a derivative of ConcreteTurtle's reel holder, which is a derivative LawrenceJohnson's reel holder, designed to fit wider and even smaller diameter PLA reels (92mm wide x 32mm ID). Motivated by a spool that I bought on Amazon (listed as Jet - PLA (3mm, Orange color, 1.0kg =2.204lbs) Filament on Spool for 3D Printer MakerBot, RepRap, MakerGear, Ultimaker and UP!)  that had a small diameter bore. \r\n\r\nNote: reducing the reel_radius parameter in the SCAD file below 32/2 caused OpenSCAD to crash on rendering, so this is the smallest reel radius possible without redesigning the assembly."
