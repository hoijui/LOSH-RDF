function = "Brian Y. is a grade 12 student who was tasked with creating a design for a real world need.  He decided to make a case for his parents iPhone 4.  He created this phone from scratch using Solid Edge as part of the requirements for his class.  The first time we printed the iPhone Case, even though it was designed to the specs of his phone, it didn't fit. He had to adjust it to deal with printing from the Makerbot using ABS.  4 copies later he had a fit that he was satisfied with."
