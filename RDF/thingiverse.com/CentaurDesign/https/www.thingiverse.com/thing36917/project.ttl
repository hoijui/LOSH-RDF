He created this phone from scratch using Solid Edge as part of the requirements for his class.  The first time we printed the iPhone Case, even though it was designed to the specs of his phone, it didn't fit. He had to adjust it to deal with printing from the Makerbot using ABS.  4 copies later he had a fit that he was satisfied with." ;
