function: "Tiffany is a grade 12 student who was ahead of the rest of the class and had a little extra time.  We were experimenting with printing tolerances for an upcoming class project.  She took a mini fig and measured it with a micrometer, doubled it's size, and re-created the minifig using Solid Edge.  Initially she built the parts with a .1mm tolerance between pegs and holes.  The design was too tight.  She then altered it so the tolerances are now .2mm between pegs and holes.\r\n\r\nWe have since discovered another design on Thingiverse that hers is very similar to: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4004\r\n\r\nHer design has a few subtle differences so we are choosing to upload it.  Enjoy!"
