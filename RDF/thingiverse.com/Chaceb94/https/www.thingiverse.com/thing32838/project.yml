function: 'This 3d printable will not only hold your breadboard and Arduino Uno conveniently side by side. It will also serve as a great little protective case/enclosure for the Arduino. This thing is really just a merging together of things from other people. Credit really goes to Torsten and mjcous for all engineering since all I did was join the 2. I did add some snaps to the case by Torsten, but it will still work I think with the original lids from: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28971'
