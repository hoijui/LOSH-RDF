function: "If you build, e.g., Prusa Mendel printers, you'll spend a lot of time cutting and filing 8mm threaded rod.  I created these vise pads to hold this size rod securely in a bench vise without slipping and without marring or damaging the threads on the rod.  \n\n\n\nCan optionally include small disc magnets, available [here](http://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=D64)  \n\n\n\nto secure the pads to steel vise jaws when the vise is open (if you put them in right, they also hold pairs of the pads together so they don't get separated in your tool drawer)."
