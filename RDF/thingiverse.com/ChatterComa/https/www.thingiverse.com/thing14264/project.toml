function = "I needed a small-diameter nozzle for my shop vac so I could suck goop out of the nooks and crannies found around my shop.  \n\nThis nozzle fits on a fairly common after-market shop vac hose with an outside diameter of 45mm.  It's available [here](http://www.woodcraft.com/Product/2000914/2780/Mr-Nozzle-Shop-VacDust-Collector-Tool-Kit.aspx)  \n\nThe nozzle gives you an 8mm vacuum aperture which moves a lot of air but is reasonably small.  \n\n\n\nThis design requires a printer build envelope at least 80mm high."
