function = "This is the best, most practical, and simplest filament manager I've seen or used for a Prusa Mendel.  It gets the filament reels out of the way into \"unused\" space above the printer, allows you to stage two reels for easy switching back and forth, and makes it simple to change reels and to see how much filament is left.  When printing, the filament itself is in free air between the reel and the extruder head so there are no jams or problems.  \r\nAlso great for dual extruder printers.  \r\nHolds from 1lb to 5lb standard filament reels.  \r\nNote:  You can add this [Nylock Nut Knob](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:148206) to this thing to allow toolless filament changes."
