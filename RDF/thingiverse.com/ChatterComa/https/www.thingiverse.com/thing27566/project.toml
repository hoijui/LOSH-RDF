function = "Since I built my Prusa Mendel, I've been looking for ways to get more light on the bed during printing.  I finally hit upon this excellent solution.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to install an extra frame vertex on one (or both) ends of the printer top bar; the vertex is enhanced to include a tab that supports one of [these great gooseneck lights sold by Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00385941/).\r\n\r\n(Strangely, you can't/couldn't actually *buy* them on the Ikea web site, but you can buy them other places, e.g., [here](http://www.amazon.com/IKEA-JANSJO-Desk-Work-Light/dp/B0055IW5UA))  Get two lights and put a mount on each end of the printer for even more light and less shadows.\r\n\r\nThe long gooseneck lets you put light wherever you want it, and it's bright enough to let you see how the print is progressing without being blinding or totally obnoxious.\r\n\r\nYou can run the light directly from your house power using the power adaptor that comes with it; I put together a simple 500mA constant current source so I could power the light from the printer's 12V supply (so everything turns on and off at once).\r\n\r\nNote that you can use the frame vertex that holds the lamp as part of this [Prusa Mendel Filament Spool Holder](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14999) to get a two-fer."
