function = "Three members of staff from Chelsea Community Hospital School (http://www.cchs.org.uk) visited colleagues in Gaza between 11-18th March(*). \r\n\r\nAlong with running some English lessons and Art workshops, we took along a 3D printer and gave students there a crash course introduction to 3D design + printing using SketchUp. \r\n\r\nWe only had 90 minutes with each group of students, so the designs are pretty basic. Nonetheless, we hope there may be a bit of interest in printing something \"Designed in Gaza\".\r\n\r\nThese designs shown here were created by students at Jabalia Prep A Boys' School, Al-Fakhura Boys' School and Beit Lahiya Girls' School. Thanks to both students and staff at those schools for their amazing enthusiasm and hospitality.\r\n\r\n(*)This coincided with something of a cross-border military escalation. At least two of these objects were designed with the sound of rockets being fired in the background."
