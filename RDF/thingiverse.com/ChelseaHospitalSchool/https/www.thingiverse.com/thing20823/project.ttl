\r
Along with running some English lessons and Art workshops, we took along a 3D printer and gave students there a crash course introduction to 3D design + printing using SketchUp. \r
\r
We only had 90 minutes with each group of students, so the designs are pretty basic. Nonetheless, we hope there may be a bit of interest in printing something "Designed in Gaza".\r
\r
These designs shown here were created by students at Jabalia Prep A Boys' School, Al-Fakhura Boys' School and Beit Lahiya Girls' School. Thanks to both students and staff at those schools for their amazing enthusiasm and hospitality.\r
\r
(*)This coincided with something of a cross-border military escalation. At least two of these objects were designed with the sound of rockets being fired in the background.""" ;
