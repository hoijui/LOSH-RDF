Works quite well I must say, although the the code ended up with some hardcoded values, which I don't really like. However, I thought, I put it up anyway. The keypad probably won't change much anyway, as otherwise I would like it to be more configurable. But, beeing based on the parametic "Simple Keypad" thing, some parts can be changed quite easly anyway.\r
\r
Eventually, I want to mount this somewhere I also have the LCD display... for instance, like this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21677 or like this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18597 ... but for now, those clunky legs will suffice... :)\r
\r
Also, hopefully someone will make a derivate and add some extra information for the buttons somehow. Such as arrows or something... :)""" ;
