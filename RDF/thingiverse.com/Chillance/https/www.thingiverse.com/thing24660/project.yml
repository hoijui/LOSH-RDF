function: "I didn't find any thing made for the keypad RepRapWorld has made ( http://reprap.org/wiki/Keypad,  http://reprapworld.com/?products_details&products_id=202&cPath=1591_1626 ), so I did one myself. Works quite well I must say, although the the code ended up with some hardcoded values, which I don't really like. However, I thought, I put it up anyway. The keypad probably won't change much anyway, as otherwise I would like it to be more configurable. But, beeing based on the parametic \"Simple Keypad\" thing, some parts can be changed quite easly anyway.\r\n\r\nEventually, I want to mount this somewhere I also have the LCD display... for instance, like this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21677 or like this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18597 ... but for now, those clunky legs will suffice... :)\r\n\r\nAlso, hopefully someone will make a derivate and add some extra information for the buttons somehow. Such as arrows or something... :)"
