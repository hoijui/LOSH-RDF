Even the KeyPad itself is modified, where now the buttons are inserted into the whole keypad thing.\r\n\r\nThe buttons provided here may a bit loose, but with this design, it's more flexible to just redesign the buttons, instead of having to reprint the keypad base. Only buttons needs to be reprinted, which saves a lot of time."
