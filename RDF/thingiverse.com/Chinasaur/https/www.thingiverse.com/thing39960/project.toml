This version is shorter so that it will fit into the bearing housing cap (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39958).  \nNote that this piece is known to fail after several months of use.  A newer, hopefully more durable design is in the works.  \nMore information: http://absurdlycertain.blogspot.com/2012/07/update-2-diy-hario-conical-burr-grinder.html  \nAvailable on Shapeways: http://www.shapeways.com/search?q=kitchenaid"
