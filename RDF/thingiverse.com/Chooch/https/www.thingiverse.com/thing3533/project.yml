function: "This is a model of Chicago\\'s Willis Tower, that I used to set a new tallest print record on 7/12/2010 @ 10:50PM. I took a Google sketchup model and heavily modified it, in order to print. \r\n\r\nhttp://wiki.makerbot.com/hall-of-fame\r\n\r\nThe model is 155mm tall! printed out at about 154mm. My bot is hacked, but using mostly original parts that came with the kit and printed parts to achieve the new record.\r\n\r\nWho: Brian J. Pierce\r\nWhat: Willis Tower\r\nWhen: July 12th, 2010\r\nHeight: 154mm\r\nBuild time: 1 hour, 10 minutes\r\nMaterial: 19cc of ABS\r\nSource file: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3533\r\nMakerBot: #1034\r\n\r\n\r\nIn case you're wondering, the actual building height without the antennae, is 136mm. The Willis tower's antennae is not counted in it's over all height, in real life."
