function: "This is the pfiercest printable pfrostruder around!\r\n\r\nI wanted to expand my printing capabilities and instead of actually buying a Frostruder, I came to the conclusion I have an awesome 3d printing powerhouse...Why not just print one?!\r\n\r\nThis is still in the beta test stage, i'm waiting for my solenoids to arrive, but thought I should release this and see what people think and or can come up with to improve the design.   \r\n\r\nUpdate 11/29/10: Now with smaller file sizes"
