Now I wish the post office would pay for the lost goods already.\r\n\r\nI had a really old Veo webcam laying around, took it apart and designed a small stealthy housing for it.\r\n\r\nI then found some good old fashioned open source software from Dorgem and a tutorial.\r\n\r\nTut:\r\nhttp://www.simplehelp.net/2006/09/27/how-to-use-your-pc-and-webcam-as-a-motion-detecting-and-recording-security-camera/\r\n\r\nDorgem:\r\nhttp://dorgem.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nAnother alternative software with many more features, is Tebocam:\r\nhttp://teboweb.com/WebCam.htm\r\n\r\nAlso my favorite software that I have found, Yawcam:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.yawcam.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, i'm working on a printable pan and tilt for this webcam... it's not quite ready yet for upload.\r\n\r\nUpdate 11/29/10: Now with smaller file sizes"
