\r
I had a really old Veo webcam laying around, took it apart and designed a small stealthy housing for it.\r
\r
I then found some good old fashioned open source software from Dorgem and a tutorial.\r

Another alternative software with many more features, is Tebocam:\r

\r
Also my favorite software that I have found, Yawcam:\r

Also, i'm working on a printable pan and tilt for this webcam... it's not quite ready yet for upload.\r
