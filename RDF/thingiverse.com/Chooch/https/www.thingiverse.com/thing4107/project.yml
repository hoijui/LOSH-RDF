function: "This is a printable Automated Build Platform 1.0 by MBI\r\n\r\nThis should get the advanced DIY hackers up and running for about $50.\r\n\r\nMotor, PET film, gears and Neo magnets can be purchased from MBI.\r\n\r\nI have not tried this out yet, so print at your own risk...It should work in theory. More updates to come.\r\n\r\nPrintable gears have been uploaded. I'm surprised howw fast they printed and that they work being so tiny! Use an M2 set screw for them. I may change the number of set screw holes if people have problems printing...keep me posted \r\n\r\nA Pfierce version will also be released soon, with some different \r\nfeatures. Pfierce version: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4189\r\n\r\nUpdate 11/29/10: Now with smaller file sizes. You can all thank Thingiverse user, naldarn for making me seek out and learn Rhino's exporting options. Now you can all enjoy smaller files!"
