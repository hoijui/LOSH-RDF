function = "After my ferrets' hammock fell a few times, I decided to create a mount that I could screw in securely, while also easily clip on and off the hammock clips.\r\n\r\nThe bracket has been in service for almost a year and the hammock has not fallen since. The bracket can easily hold ~10lbs of ferrets when they decide to all stuff into the one hammock."
