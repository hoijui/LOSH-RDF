function: "With Snowmageddon, Snowpocalypse and Snowzilla wreaking havoc on Chicago, I said SnOMG! and thought this may be a fitting upload. I've always wanted snowshoes for such occasions. Luckily, work has been cancelled today, so I wont have to walk in this blizzard, but I am looking for a fun project to do while i'm home.\r\n\r\nThese are low polygon snowshoes, now you can't print them out with a 3D printer, but you can print them out on a 2D printer with a papercraft program called Pepakura Designer. It allows you to make 3D objects out of paper. \r\n\r\nNow, you're saying what good are paper snowshoes? Well, not good at all... until you fiberglass them and fill them with your choice of filler, like casting resin. So, the next big snow storm I'll be ready!\r\n\r\nI left some areas of the shoe open for cloth covering and as you can see it has some good crampon spikes for grip.\r\n\r\nI also contemplated making sheet metal snowshoes and even laser cut wood snowshoes, maybe someone else can give that a try.\r\n\r\nFrom the picture you can see the garage is pretty well snowed in.\r\n\r\nI also added the object file & STL if you want to unfold it yourself or do something else with it."
