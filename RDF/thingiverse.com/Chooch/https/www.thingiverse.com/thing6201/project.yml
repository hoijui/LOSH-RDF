function: "This is a handle for cabinets, drawers, doors etc.\r\n\r\nDesigned this real quick while on lunch, because I saw a need for it. \r\n\r\nYou will need a completely flat build platform for this (no screws in the way). Haven't printed it out myself yet, that's why I uploaded two versions.\r\n\r\nHandle_1 is longer (ideal size for usage) and it may be at the limits of what a cupcake can print.  ***update, it prints without a problem on my 100x100 platform, i'll leave both files up though."
