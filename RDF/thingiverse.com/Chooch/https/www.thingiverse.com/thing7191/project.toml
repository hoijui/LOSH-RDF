function = "This is Barton Dring's buildlog.net laser cutter 2.0 (not the 2X laser cutter) x-y & z axis parts, plus the laser tube clamps for 3d printing. Printable pulleys to come later.\r\n\r\nThe parts have been modified to fit on a true 100x100mm build platform. (no allowance for screw heads on stock BP's) Added M3 holes and nut slots for parts that would normally need to be tapped.\r\n\r\nI'd Also like to thank Nick Wilson for donating to the www.Pfierce.com Pflaser project; a low cost laser cutter project, because of you I thought I'd give back and help some others out by releasing this, thanks again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuildlog.Net laser by Barton Dring is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License.\r\nBased on a work at www.buildlog.net.\r\nPermissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at http://www.buildlog.net/cnc_laser/drawings.html.\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License."
