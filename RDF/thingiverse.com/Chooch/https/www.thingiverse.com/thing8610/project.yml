function: "After enjoying some crackers I wanted to be able to close the bag to keep them fresh. Alas, I was out of twist-ties to close the bag...\r\n\r\nMakerbot to the rescue!\r\n\r\nI quickly designed this bag clip, based off of a bread loaf clip picture. \r\n\r\nYou can use this to close bags full of parts or any plastic bag for that matter, enjoy."
