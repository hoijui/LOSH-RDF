function = "This is a laser scanning system that I designed to use with DAVID 3D Scanner software.  I have yet to buy the software, but the free version really lets you try out everything before you buy...you can at least take some high resolution screenshots of your scans. You can save low resolution files and use meshlab to assemble them.\r\n\r\nMore info at: http://www.david-laserscanner.com/\r\n\r\nThe first scanner I designed was complicated and used gears and a stepper motor, this one works much better. It's cheaper, requires no electricity to move and has less parts. It even tells you when it's done scanning!\r\n\r\nIt uses a Taylor kitchen timer, this is a mechanical wound timer that you can purchase at Target, for about $3 PN: 5833-21\r\n\r\nWhen combined with custom makerbot parts, two M3 screws/nuts and a red or green focus-able line laser you have a nice smoothly sweeping laser system."
