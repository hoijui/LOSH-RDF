I recommend to print the uni-X Wade instead http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25416 \r
\r
I was always wondering why there are so much different Wade`s and never knew exactly which one is the right one to print.\r
\r
Therefore i tried to make one Wade that will fit (nearly) all Mounting plates and hotends.\r
\r
The insert hole dimension is d=16,7mm  height = 20mm\r
\r
The Wade itself is designed to work with 3mm ABS/PLA, if you want to print with 1,75mm material just buy a small brasstube (d=2,1mm D=3mm) and put it between the hobbedbolt and the hotend.\r
\r
The inserts are made d=16,4mm height= 19,9mm\r
\r
if there are some dimensions wrong or some weak points please tell me and i will try to fix them.\r
\r
 EDIT3:  New V2 Uploaded.  (13.05.2012)\r

Fixes:  \r
* Holes for Orca v040 X-Carrier\r
* small bridge to the Idlerholderpart (for easier printing)\r
* countersunk holes for insert screw`s\r
* tested on Orca V 0.40""" ;
