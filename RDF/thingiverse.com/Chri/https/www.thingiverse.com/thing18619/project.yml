function: "OUTDATED DESIGN !!!\r\nI recommend to print the uni-X Wade instead http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25416 \r\n\r\nI was always wondering why there are so much different Wade`s and never knew exactly which one is the right one to print.\r\n\r\nTherefore i tried to make one Wade that will fit (nearly) all Mounting plates and hotends.\r\n\r\nThe insert hole dimension is d=16,7mm  height = 20mm\r\n\r\nThe Wade itself is designed to work with 3mm ABS/PLA, if you want to print with 1,75mm material just buy a small brasstube (d=2,1mm D=3mm) and put it between the hobbedbolt and the hotend.\r\n\r\nThe inserts are made d=16,4mm height= 19,9mm\r\n\r\nif there are some dimensions wrong or some weak points please tell me and i will try to fix them.\r\n\r\n EDIT3:  New V2 Uploaded.  (13.05.2012)\r\n\r\nFixes:  \r\n* Holes for Orca v040 X-Carrier\r\n* small bridge to the Idlerholderpart (for easier printing)\r\n* countersunk holes for insert screw`s\r\n* tested on Orca V 0.40"
