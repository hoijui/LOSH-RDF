function = "The Micro extruder was not small enough (still over  70mm) for me so i designed a new body from scratch.\r\n\r\nWith the smaller size a new uniX-hotend V2 assembly version is released !\r\n\r\nFeatures: \r\n\r\n* very compact design, only 50mm tall !!!\r\n\r\n* Overall weight of complete extruder with hotend can be under 200 gramms !\r\n\r\n* uni-X V2 Universal Hotend system -> Works with alot of different Hotends \r\n(no need of a metalplate for V9/v10 Hotend anymore !!!)\r\n\r\n* 50mm assembly holes\r\n\r\n* should work with 3mm and 1,75 material (using brass tub insert)\r\n\r\n\r\nStill missing: fanmount -> can be used from a other PG35 extruder.\r\n\r\n* i already made some specific hotend derivates from this with only 43mm height, maybe i`ll release them later (some weeks)"
