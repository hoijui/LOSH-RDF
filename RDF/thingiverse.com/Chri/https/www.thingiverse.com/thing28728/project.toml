function = "I designed a compact mechanical endstop holder for a second Orca i am building.  \nReason for nearly closed case is that it will hold the endstop better than only two short fans (when properly printed) and for a optical nicer look.  \nCorners are all rounded for better and faster printing  \n\nShould also fit any other printer with 8mm rod"
