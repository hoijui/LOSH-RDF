function = "A friend wanted a way of preventing the Home Button from being accidentally pressed when using an iPad2. \r\n\r\nKnocked this rough and ready version up in a few minutes on Sketchup. Someone with skill could do better with their eyes closed.\r\n\r\nIn my defence, dimensions were pretty much done by eye as I only had a builder's tape measure to hand(!) Seems to be a fairly decent push fit nonetheless. \r\n\r\nPrints fine on an UP printer.\r\n\r\nPlease don't blame me if it damages the dock connector on your expensive iPad."
