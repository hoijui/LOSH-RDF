I read Rich's Blog http://richrap.blogspot.com/2011/06/1st-replication-and-design-improvement.html where he discussed a simple lever. I could not find his STL file, so I quickly did this attempt in Google Sketchup.\r

[EDIT - I have uploaded a cleaner and more centered lever.]\r
\r
If this already exists then please accept this as just my version that I printed.""" ;
