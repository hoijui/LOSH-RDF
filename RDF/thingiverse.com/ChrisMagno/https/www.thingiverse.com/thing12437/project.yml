function: "I really love using Gregs Hinged Extruder; but with a new printer, I was in and out of the filament slot so often I found I could use some help. I read Rich's Blog http://richrap.blogspot.com/2011/06/1st-replication-and-design-improvement.html where he discussed a simple lever. I could not find his STL file, so I quickly did this attempt in Google Sketchup.\r\n\r\n[EDIT - I have uploaded a cleaner and more centered lever.]\r\n\r\nIf this already exists then please accept this as just my version that I printed."
