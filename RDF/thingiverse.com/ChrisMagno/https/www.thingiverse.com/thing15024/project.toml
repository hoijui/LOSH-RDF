function = "This is a derivative of the excellent Do-Nothing Machine by RayRaywasHere.  I  could not seem to list this thing as a version of RayRaywasHere. So I just went and listed it as new.  This is not a new thing. This is my version of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5103.\r\n\r\nI removed the pin in the shuttle and replaced it with a hole for the Pin/Rivet I designed.\r\n\r\nI made the arm holes larger to acomdate the rivets.\r\n\r\nThe base is unchanged from the original and was a pleasure for me to both print, and test."
