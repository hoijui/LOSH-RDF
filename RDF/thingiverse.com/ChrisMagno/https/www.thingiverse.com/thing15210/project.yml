function: "I never had any luck hobbing a bolt using the tap method.  When I used my rotary tool by hand, the teeth came out uneven.\r\n\r\nThis work in progress jig should allow for either a 8mm, or 5/16\" bolt (or rod with nut) to be  indexed to 19 positions. The ratchet head was edited from this excellent thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8752\r\n\r\nI put up a short 30 second video of this jig being used.  I was holding the camera, and using the rotary tool and making sparks fly all at the same time. With some practice, I feel  I will be able to make many bolts for my army of 3D printers.  \r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/KpnZK_AJLgM\r\n\r\n- Edit - \r\n\r\nThe idea for this thing came to me after seeing many great ways/things to hob bolts. (That and after the snow I didn't want to go out to the cold work shed)  My thing is an amalgamation of many of the ideas found here on Thingiverse:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9291\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10360\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10110\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11275"
