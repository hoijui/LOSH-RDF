function = "I bought a inexpensive 3\" bench vice from Lowes. \r\n\r\nThe Jaws are smooth, flat, and iron.  I did not find any things here that matched my vice, so I printed these designed with Sketchup.  \r\n\r\nI am posting the SKP file so that others can take the base design, and modify the jaw plate for their specific task.\r\n\r\nI am using the basic design to clamp the work piece and not mar the surface.  It would not be too difficult to modify the jaw to hold rods, bolts or other odd shaped items ."
