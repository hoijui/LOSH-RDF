    okh:function """I take my extruder on and off my Prusa to change out the hot ends often.  I love Gregâ€™s X carriage, but I find it takes some fiddling to retighten the belts.  After seeing this, neat thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16730\r
\r
 I wanted to try to build that concept into the X carriage, and while I was at it, try to reduce the hardware parts count.  I tried to utilize the concept of a Drop Clamp which self tightens as strain is put on the wire.  My thing is fixed on one side of the x carriage, and the other side uses the self tightening idea.    \r
\r
As an afterthought I added one screw, and bolt hole (M4 or 6-32) to use if required to add a bit more tension if your belt still has some slop.\r
\r
The LM8UU bearing holder was copied from this thing, and then modified to suit my needs.\r

\r
This was more an experiment to try the idea, as opposed to a finished product.  I wanted to share with the community in the hopes that maybe it might inspire someone to build on the concept and reduce the hardware count.""" ;
