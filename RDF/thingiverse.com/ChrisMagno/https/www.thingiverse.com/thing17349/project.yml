function: "I take my extruder on and off my Prusa to change out the hot ends often.  I love Greg\xE2\u20AC\u2122s X carriage, but I find it takes some fiddling to retighten the belts.  After seeing this, neat thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16730\r\n\r\n I wanted to try to build that concept into the X carriage, and while I was at it, try to reduce the hardware parts count.  I tried to utilize the concept of a Drop Clamp which self tightens as strain is put on the wire.  My thing is fixed on one side of the x carriage, and the other side uses the self tightening idea.    \r\n\r\nAs an afterthought I added one screw, and bolt hole (M4 or 6-32) to use if required to add a bit more tension if your belt still has some slop.\r\n\r\nThe LM8UU bearing holder was copied from this thing, and then modified to suit my needs.\r\n  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15219\r\n\r\nThis was more an experiment to try the idea, as opposed to a finished product.  I wanted to share with the community in the hopes that maybe it might inspire someone to build on the concept and reduce the hardware count."
