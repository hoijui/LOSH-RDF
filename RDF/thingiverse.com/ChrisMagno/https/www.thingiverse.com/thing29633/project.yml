function: "I designed, and printed this upholstery attachment for a 1 1/4\" shop vac hose.\r\n\r\nI own the shop vac, but lost all the attachments years ago.  Late on a Saturday evening I thought it would be easier to vacuum the van with the right attachment vs just the bare hose end.  I designed the attachment in Sketchup, more as a  challenge to see if a) I could b) it would print and c) would it work.\r\n\r\nThe pictures show more than a thousand words."
