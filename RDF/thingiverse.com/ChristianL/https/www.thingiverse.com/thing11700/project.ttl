    okh:function "Holder that neatly wraps up standard ear bud headphones.  The design was made in Autodesk Inventor Professional 2012 and printed using the Makerbot Thing-o-Matic.  Material used to print was 3mm ABS plastic filament.  The design incorporates slots to organize how the headphones are wrapped up instead of just wrapping them around an iPod or cellular device.  There are two slots on the top to hold the ear buds in place.  On the bottom there is another slot to secure the ear buds tightly to the device.  There is one more slot on the side to direct which way the wire of the headphones should wrap up." ;
