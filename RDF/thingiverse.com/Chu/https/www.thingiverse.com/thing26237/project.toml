function = "Inspired by Arduino design and the iPhone Bumper, I present to you the Arduino Bumper!  \n\nBy installing this minimalist case, it allows the Arduino to be placed onto a flat conductive surface without shorting it out.   \n\nThe bumper press fits onto the Arduino Uno and Leonardo. Recessed grooves located under where the Arduino pins sit allow the back of the board to sit flat in the bumper.   \n\nUpdate: Arduino Bumper 0006 has mounting holes."
