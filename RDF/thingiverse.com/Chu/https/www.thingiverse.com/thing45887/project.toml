function = "Two types of diffusers to fit onto the Canon Speedlight 580EX II flash. I made these for our photographer at MAKE and they've been holding up even after several weeks of daily use.\r\n\r\nThe triangular version maximizes surface area for greater light diffusion. \r\n\r\nThe rectangular version is smaller but can be slid down the flash to make it compact and portable. \r\n\r\nBoth have a tight slide fit that allows the diffuser to be adjusted up or down the flash.\r\n\r\nAutodesk Inventor file included."
