function = "Here is a modified version of Zach's Plastruder design.  These layers replace the ones inside the MK4 plastruder to help guide the Idler Wheel.  This keeps it straight and on target.  I have managed to crush filament without so much as a crack on the acrylic idler wheel.\r\n\r\nI still wouldnt recommend crushing filament just because you can...but this will atleast keep you from replacing an idler wheel every so often.\r\n\r\nNOTE*  The rendering engine on Thingiverse makes the files appear wobbly, but when loaded into the proper software they should show perfectly round."
