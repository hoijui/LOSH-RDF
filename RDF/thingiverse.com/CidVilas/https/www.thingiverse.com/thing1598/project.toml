function = "This part simply holds your phone for a \"desktop\" mode.  This will probably work for many other phones, but i have only tested with the Nexus One.\r\n\r\nIm sure you can cut a hole in the bottom and slip a power cord in, but it wont be as simple as dropping a phone in and lifting it out.\r\n\r\nApproximate build time: 3 hours +/- 0.5 hour\r\n\r\nGCode has been provided as a reference, but is probably not compatible with your particular printer."
