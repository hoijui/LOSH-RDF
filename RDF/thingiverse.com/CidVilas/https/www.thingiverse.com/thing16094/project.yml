function: "UPDATE: Fixed a few lines of code which made things wonky if you change the dimensions of the walls.\r\n\r\nInspired by Nophead, I wanted to implement his ideas for Mendel90 into a printer design.  I made an OpenSCAD script to generate the mount for his linear bearings.  Hope it comes in handy to someone.\r\n\r\nCheck out NopHead's blog.  Its the best!\r\nhttp://www.hydraraptor.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nMy design could be significantly optimized, but it does work."
