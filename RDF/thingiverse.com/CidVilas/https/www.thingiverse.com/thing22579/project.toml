function = "Update<5-6-12>: Corrected some dimensions in the SCAD\r\n\r\nInspired by the many attempts to create a spool holder.\r\n\r\nThe STL file contains a printable spool holder for the Cheap Chinese Spools coming from RepRaper.com. \r\n\r\nThe OpenSCAD file allows you to enter in just a few details about your particular spool, and hardware.  After that you simply compile and print.  These types of spool holders are great, but require care.  If you let the filament get too loose, it will tangle.  So be sure to keep tension on that filament!\r\n\r\nPrepared STLs:\r\n  - PrintableSpoolHolder-MakerGear.STL\r\n  - PrintableSpoolHolder-RepRaper.STL"
