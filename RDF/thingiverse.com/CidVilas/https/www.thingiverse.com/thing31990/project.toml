He tosses them in the air and the ones that land bottom up lose, and the ones that land top up win.  Sensei seems to win often.  (Bottom is the print surface, and top is the final layer of printing.)\r\n\r\nIncluded: Jay, Kai, Skeleton, Sensei, and Lloyd\r\n\r\nThese would be perfect for a homemade halloween costume.  Need an emblem? Print one out! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:  The original SVG files were pulled from the official Ninjago Wiki: http://ninja.brickcraft.me/wiki/Main_Page\r\nI then imported to OpenSCAD and extruded the outlines."
