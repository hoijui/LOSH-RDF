function = "I want it all built in.  I do not like to have things hanging off the side as im carrying my printer.  My first Sells Mendel had external box for electronics and heated bed controller.  For my new Prusa i2 Mendel, i wanted to have all components integrated to the frame.  So here is my attempt at making a Power and USB mount.  Take a look at the pictures! :)\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, i inserted a Relay to turn the power supply on or off using the GCode command M80 or M81.\r\n\r\nThere are added holes for Zip Ties.  These help strain relief for the cables and simplify mounting to the Mendel frame."
