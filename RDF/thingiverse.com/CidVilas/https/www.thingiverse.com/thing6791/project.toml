function = "The idea behind this instrument is that you print the bracket, and mount onto the X carriage on a Mendel.  The rod is then dropped into the bracket and allowed to drag across the surface of the build platform.  As the rod is dragged across the surface, it will extend and retract depending on the current height per location on the platform.  This is a simple and cheap alternative to a Height Gauge.  The resolution is limited as compared to an authentic height gauge, but i suspect is a worthy alternative."
