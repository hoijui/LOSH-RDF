The capacitor  and jumper switches under the Polulu may or may not fit.  Also, i changed the connector for the stepper to a standard 0.1" header.\r
\r
This is simply a manipulation of the PSMD Triple Axis Driver by 'tinkerings'.  \r
The idea is that it replaces the need for 5 stepper boards using the Gen 4 Makerbot electronics and replaces it with only one board. (Not counting the 5 pololu boards).\r
\r
\r
The first step for me was to recreate the previous version with an additional 2 stepper drivers.  Next step is to make the connector a 30-pin ribbon so i can create custom boards for various controllers. :P\r
\r
Note: Some Pololu drivers can operate at 3.3V and 5V...just saying. :)  The end stop connectors on A and B is for experimental purposes.  I know it consumes unnecessary pinnage, but you never know what it may be used for...encoder? :)\r
\r
UPDATE #1: Thanks for the tips Protonite!  I've added some changes that some people may like, and some may find it really annoying. :)  I changed the 10 pin connector to a 6 pin connector, like on the Makerbot boards.  I've axed the Max Endstop for good measure.  The Makerbot motherboard has 2 pins unused.  I added VCC and Minumum Endstop signal to these pins.  It should not affect the Makerbot Motherboards compatibility.  Ive added both the PC Power Supply plug, and a screw terminal connection.  There is also a switch added so you can turn off the Voltage to the motors without powering down the supply completely.  Useful for servicing the stepper boards.  I appreciate the input advice!  I think the new layout looks pretty sick, and i cant wait to get a working version made. :)\r

Compatibility:\r
  Makerbot Motherboard;  Stepper Motors require standard 0.1" header""" ;
