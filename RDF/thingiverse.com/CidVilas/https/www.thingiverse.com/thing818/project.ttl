This is a build platform which i redesigned using the concepts provided by Zach Hoeken for the Cupcake CNC and other people through out the community.  I do not have a working MakerBot as of yet, but im getting there.  Since i have not tested this out, i cannot guarantee its operation.  Please write me some comments if you try it out, letting me know if you successfully make a print using this design.""" ;
