function: "Note: The CorelDraw file contains 2 pages.  Each page is a seperate piece.  I titled the pages by material thickness.\r\n\r\nThis is a build platform which i redesigned using the concepts provided by Zach Hoeken for the Cupcake CNC and other people through out the community.  I do not have a working MakerBot as of yet, but im getting there.  Since i have not tested this out, i cannot guarantee its operation.  Please write me some comments if you try it out, letting me know if you successfully make a print using this design."
