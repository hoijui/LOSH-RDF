function: "Generic Skull\r\nThe curves seem to be gentle enough to print on a Cupcake CNC by MakerBot Industries.  Gah...I want a working Cupcake CNC already!  Soon.  :)\r\n\r\nUpdate:  I split this in Skeinforge and there are a few parts on the upper jaw which hang just a bit.  This is the only part that may not print properly.  The rest of the skull should \"in theory\" work."
