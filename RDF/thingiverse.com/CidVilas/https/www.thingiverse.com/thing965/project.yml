function: "This is a derivative of the filament spindle made by Erik on Thingiverse.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to operate along side the Makerbot rather then the RepRap. Because the Makerbot Cupcake CNC does not have the same structure that the RepRap does, the original design does not work.  By attaching the stand we now have a standard spindle which works with any system.\r\n\r\nProblems that still need to be addressed:\r\n- Spindle spins so freely that the filament itself would probably unwind itself slowly.  In the future i would like to add a screw that can be tightened which adds friction to the sides. Keeping the spindle from spinning 'too' freely.\r\n- The Spindle is slightly underweight and with enough lateral force could topple.  To address this issue simply attach something heavy to the base.  Or add an additional acrylic piece perpendicular to the current stand to increase the base size."
