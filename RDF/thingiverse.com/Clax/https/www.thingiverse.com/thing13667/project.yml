function: "An enclosure for Gen 6 is not nothing new. Even other people have designed cooling systems for \"GEN6 electronics\" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12302, but this provides some additional feature.\r\nThe air flow is conveyed on the GEN6 heatsinks, and in particular, with two wings (Fig. 3 and 4), concentrated on the heatsink of the extruder motor. This is because it is the most critical, that heat up more.\r\nEven the air outlet holes are more focused on that side to facilitate cooling.\r\nin addition, the part \"2\" is not limited to lean on the cover, but joins in it.\r\nIn addition, the wires are all internally, at the top and are fixed to the output (Figure 6) and this, I like the most.\r\nThis project is expected to GEN6 installed with screws from the bottom and four spacers (Fig. 5). This in order to remove the cover with more ease.\r\n\r\nThis project requires a 40mm fan, four 3mm screws and two 2mm screws (like wood)"
