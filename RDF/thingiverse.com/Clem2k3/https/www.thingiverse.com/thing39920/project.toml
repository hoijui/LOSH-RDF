This was clearly a modified version of another piece of code so I stripped out the bits that weren't needed and re-wrote the code in a way that (to my view) is easier to follow and tried to comment it completely.\r\n\r\n- Flipped the wings over. X-wings have forward swept wings for some reason.\r\n\r\n- Split the model in 2 and added a joining piece (so it can still be printed without support).\r\n\r\n- Made a SCAD for the guns and engines (my design) and wheels and R2D2 (original design)\r\n\r\nSo here I present my derivative ..."
