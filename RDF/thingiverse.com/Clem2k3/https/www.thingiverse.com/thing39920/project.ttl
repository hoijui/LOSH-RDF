    okh:function """I printed the original X-wing car for my 3yo nephew and it took him all of about a day to break it, which at least shows he was playing with it :). It broke off one of the wings where the wheel was too near an edge.\r
\r
So I took the SCAD file and made some modifications:\r
\r
- Shrunk the wheel holes (they were way too big).\r
\r
- Tidied the code ... a lot. This was clearly a modified version of another piece of code so I stripped out the bits that weren't needed and re-wrote the code in a way that (to my view) is easier to follow and tried to comment it completely.\r
\r
- Flipped the wings over. X-wings have forward swept wings for some reason.\r
\r
- Split the model in 2 and added a joining piece (so it can still be printed without support).\r
\r
- Made a SCAD for the guns and engines (my design) and wheels and R2D2 (original design)\r
\r
So here I present my derivative ...""" ;
