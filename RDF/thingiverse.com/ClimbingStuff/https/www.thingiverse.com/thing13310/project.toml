function = "designed like a giant steel and birch makerbot with a skillet controlled by an autotransformer. Fyi this hack does Not work without the autotransformer, a skillet has way to much radiant heat, but i have the skillet set for max and the autotransforner set for 40% power (less during summer)\r\n\r\ni just figured it was time this was documented a little.  the weight of the bed limits my prints to 40mm/sec and after using a thingomatic with mk6+ extruder .. it needs a stepstruder :) so that is in the works. \r\n\r\nrunning on gen 3 elecrtonics and a mk4 plastruder."
