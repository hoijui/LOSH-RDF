function: "This is a printable badge for judges at a show. It is a companion for the 1st place ribbon badges that can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24941\r\n\r\nThis was developed alongside an awesome local graphic designer Brett Sirianni from The Edge.  Brett did the original 2D design, and I converted it into a 3D shape using blender."
