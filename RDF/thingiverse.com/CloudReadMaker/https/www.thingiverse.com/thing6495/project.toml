function = "Design made in Sketchup, based on the sculpture LOVE by Robert Indiana.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_%28sculpture%29\r\n\r\nThe font is Times New Roman used in the Sketchup 3D Text tool. The \"O\" was rotated in Sketchup also. Individual letters have been moved very closely together but do not touch, Skeinforge didn't like that. \r\n\r\nNow if somebody knows and can tell me how not to get strange messages from Skeinforge when I have the letters touch each other in Sketchup, I'd be very grateful!"
