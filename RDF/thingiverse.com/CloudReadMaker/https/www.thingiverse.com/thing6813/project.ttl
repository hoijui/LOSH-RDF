    okh:function """Different wiring of the relays removes risk of shorting the power supply, so no need for diodes to motor, but I added a resistance of 8 Ohms as additional security (in case the motor decides to short internally, probably not necessary).\r
\r
Also, there are no capacitors, because they might influence reaction speed of relays.\r
\r
I did the schematics with "fritzing", somehow they don't look as fancy and understandable as other schematics seen around here. What software do you use to draw schematics (on a mac) ?\r
\r
This absolutely solved the erratic bahaviour of the DC Extruder Motor, who is now ready to print correctly the parts for a stepper extruder. :-)""" ;
