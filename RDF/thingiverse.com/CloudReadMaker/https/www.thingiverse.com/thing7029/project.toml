function = "Had this LED Cube I build some time ago piloted by an Arduino.\r\n\r\nWant to make a clean version, so I started by designing a frame to hold the LED's.\r\n\r\nMy first OpenSCAD script, tried to make it as parametric as possible.\r\n\r\nThis is far from a finished cube, but the grid already comes out nicely.\r\n\r\nThe electronics use a MAX 7219 chip, piloted by Arduino, only uses 3! ports from Arduino."
