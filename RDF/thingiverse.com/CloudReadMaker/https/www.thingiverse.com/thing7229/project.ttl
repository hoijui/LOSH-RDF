\r
Result: As of now, do not build this hotend, or use other resistors, I already fried two.. so back to brainstorming mode! \r
\r
In the final steps of finishing a RepRap Mendel, I was fideling with the Extruder Hot End. \r
\r
Unable to get a nice working and easy to connect Nichrome wire heater, I switched to power-resistor usage and found myself with the big question of how to attach it to the nozzle.\r
\r
Found the following: Attach the rectangular 6R8 5W resistor (with ceramic casing) with... Copper Wire to the nozzle. Add lots of heat conducting paste.\r
\r
Build a heat shield with... Capton Tape, several layers of it, folded onto a square copper wire frame to give more stability.\r
\r
Add a 5 Cent Euro piece (copper) to the bottom to fix it all, with one threaded 6mm hole for the nozzle, and one 2mm hole for the thermistor.\r
\r
Connected to 12V Power Source, Manual Extrusion works flawlessly already (and without burning my fingers holding the PEEK insulator).\r
\r
More on this design as soon as I have been using it for some prints. \r
 \r
Will probably also add capton tape to the bottom side of the printed Wade's extruder for thermic insulation.\r
\r
Improvement suggestions are welcome.\r

\r
The test rig is an arduino piloting a pololu at a speed set by the variable resistor.""" ;
