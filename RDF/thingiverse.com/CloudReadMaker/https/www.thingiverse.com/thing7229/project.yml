function: "Aim: Make an easy and fast hotend not needing any special tools.\r\n\r\nResult: As of now, do not build this hotend, or use other resistors, I already fried two.. so back to brainstorming mode! \r\n\r\nIn the final steps of finishing a RepRap Mendel, I was fideling with the Extruder Hot End. \r\n\r\nUnable to get a nice working and easy to connect Nichrome wire heater, I switched to power-resistor usage and found myself with the big question of how to attach it to the nozzle.\r\n\r\nFound the following: Attach the rectangular 6R8 5W resistor (with ceramic casing) with... Copper Wire to the nozzle. Add lots of heat conducting paste.\r\n\r\nBuild a heat shield with... Capton Tape, several layers of it, folded onto a square copper wire frame to give more stability.\r\n\r\nAdd a 5 Cent Euro piece (copper) to the bottom to fix it all, with one threaded 6mm hole for the nozzle, and one 2mm hole for the thermistor.\r\n\r\nConnected to 12V Power Source, Manual Extrusion works flawlessly already (and without burning my fingers holding the PEEK insulator).\r\n\r\nMore on this design as soon as I have been using it for some prints. \r\n \r\nWill probably also add capton tape to the bottom side of the printed Wade's extruder for thermic insulation.\r\n\r\nImprovement suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nVideo of 1st test run on extruder: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdaGdV4FYUY\r\n\r\nVideo of 2nd test run (high speed): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI6yL4VfNfo\r\n\r\nThe test rig is an arduino piloting a pololu at a speed set by the variable resistor."
