function = "I love my quad line kites (beamer/toxic from hq) for their incredible maneuverability and power. But when it comes to packing up they are a mess compared to my depower kite with control bar. The lines start to separate into single filaments after winding und unwinding several times. To avoid this the lines should be wound in a figure 8. To be able to do that I designed the kite horns that can be attached to the handles before packing."
