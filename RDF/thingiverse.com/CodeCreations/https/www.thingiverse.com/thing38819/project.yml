function: "Update: Latest version fixes a customizer bug that hides the case hole size parameter. (Previously 133 downloads.)  \n\nThis thing covers a larger hole in an enclosure while still providing space for a cable to fit. This is useful when you need to drill a larger hole in order to fit the cable ends through the enclosure wall but want to limit the overall size of the opening.  \n\nIt's fully parametric and commented. There are 10 parameters designed to make it easy to customize for your application.   \n\nIn the photo you can see that the hardboard is blown out (because I didn't have it supported properly when I drilled through it). Regardless the plug still works perfectly. I made the opening for the cable slightly larger than the cable itself so I could fit a few more small wires through it as well. It's very solid and holds very nicely.   \n\nI'm using this for an enclosure for one of my 3D printers to exhaust ABS fumes.   \n\nIf you're building an enclosure and need adapters for exhaust tubes, try this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38813  \n\nI use this as part of my parametric printer enclosure, which is available here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39787"
