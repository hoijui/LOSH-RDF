function = "I have had this pair of knuckles designed for some time. I have since wanted to make a carabiner combination.

Absolutely, but you may get stopped on the street for wearing one. \r\nWin win.\r\n\r\nCarabiner mechanism thanks to Jinja. I credit the name of this thing to Jeremy Gonzalez's quick wit."
