function: "I have had this pair of knuckles designed for some time. I have since wanted to make a carabiner combination. Now is the time that they collide for more form than function. \r\nFunctioning knuckles? Sure, although you might hurt yourself. \r\nFunctioning carabiner? Absolutely, but you may get stopped on the street for wearing one. \r\nWin win.\r\n\r\nCarabiner mechanism thanks to Jinja. I credit the name of this thing to Jeremy Gonzalez's quick wit."
