    okh:function """A simple and sturdy caddy to hold your blow-off-tube assembly to the side of your fermenter so it is easy to move, and cannot be knocked over by people or pets. Plus the sanitizer vessel now has a more secure top.\r
\r
\r
If you have ever brewed beer before you may have needed a blow-off-tube to stick into the top of your fermenter. This tube, and chamber acts like an over sized airlock that will (Hopefully) catch any excess foam and liquid that may have sprayed out due to vigorous fermentation.\r
\r
Why print this part? Well if you have used a blow off tube, then you have probably taped a length of tube into an open vessel full of sanitizing solution, hoping the whole thing doesn't fall over and spill everywhere. It is also a pain if you ever have to move the fermenter since its has a length of tube precariously stuck into the top of an open vessel like a cup or bowl. \r
\r
The main reason I made this caddy is because I have a cat, a very curious one! I sure don't want to leave an open container of sanitizer out, and even if its somewhat sealed, he could knock it over. But not any more! Print these two parts, buy a few rubber bands and a ball jar, and keep your fermenter setup nice and organized.""" ;
