function = "A fast and simple quick-release mount, so you can use your Iphone 5 on your tripod.\r\n\r\nWe shoot a TON of video and photos at my job, but sometimes it just needs to be a quick reference shot. In this case the fastest way to take a pic/video quickly is to whip out my trusty Iphone 5, and shoot away. \r\n\r\nBut when there is no one around to hold the phone, and I need to shoot video, or a picture at a difficult angle, I use this quick-release. \r\n\r\nI know for a fact it fits a Manfrotto Tripod perfectly, but am not sure about other tripod companies, if anyone prints one out, and wants to try it on their tripod PLEASE send me a message with what type of Tripod you are using so I can add it to the list!"
