function = "A printable part that lets you attach a strap to the Russian Sputnik Camera.\r\n\r\nFor some odd reason the designers of the Russian Sputnik Stereo Camera felt that no one would want to use this big bulky thing with a camera strap. Well, I did. So I went ahead and printed out these simple strap lugs. \r\n\r\nThey replace the black metal winding knob parts (Shown in the images attached to this page)"
