function = "A printable Remote Mine prop with blinking lights, a beeper, and a magnetic back!\r\n\r\nIf you grew up in the 90's, you've played Goldeneye, and if you've played Goldeneye you should recognize this classic weapon!\r\n\r\nAfter creating a tutorial on Instructables (http://www.instructables.com/id/Goldeneye-007-Remote-Mine-Prop/)\r\nOn how to make a Remote Mine using an old joystick base, I decided that I would model one up so others could print their own. The problem with my instrucable is it requires you to find a \"PC Commander\" Joystick from the 90's to use as the Remote Mine's body. It took me about a month to track one down, and they get more rare every year. So now that this ancient component is nearly extinct I wanted to make sure everyone could still make their own remote mine prop.\r\n\r\nWith a few components and some patience you too can make your very own remote mine prop, chock full of blinking lights and beeping sounds!"
