function: "*Update to my original design* These are well-balanced strap lugs for a Sputnik Russian stereo camera. I have designed them to work in both plastic, and stainless steel.\r\n\r\n\r\nA printable part (Works in plastic, but I decided to have mine made in stainless steel) that lets you attach a strap to the Russian Sputnik Camera. For some odd reason the designers of the Russian Sputnik Stereo Camera felt that no one would want to use this big bulky thing with a camera strap. Well, I did. So I went ahead and printed out these simple strap lugs. They replace the black metal winding knob parts which adds a strap lug to the camera. I have tried and tested this part in both plastic, and stainless steel, and while I do trust the plastic, I much prefer the stainless (Which is shown above)"
