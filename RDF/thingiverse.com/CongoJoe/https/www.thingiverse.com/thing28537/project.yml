function: "I really liked the Adafruit Pi case so I made my own version. \r\n\r\nIt will stack tightly and has both a full legnth top and a shorter top for use with the slice of pi board by Ciseco http://goo.gl/566lk\r\n\r\nThis version is drawn from scratch in draftsight rather that from the Adafruit file here (I actually didnt see it on thingiverse until after finishing the basic layout so figured I may as well finish it). \r\n\r\nThe etched logos in the photos are all from thenounproject.com with the exception of the Raspberry Pi Logo.\r\n\r\nIts designed to be cut from 3mm material. Personally i like it in wood :)\r\n\r\nPrototyped at the wonderful Nottingham Hackspace http://nottinghack.org.uk/ \r\n\r\nBuild photos here http://goo.gl/oEH5c\r\n\r\nIcons\r\nhttp://thenounproject.com/noun/ethernet/#icon-No456\r\nhttp://thenounproject.com/noun/power/#icon-No94\r\nhttp://thenounproject.com/noun/usb/#icon-No140\r\nhttp://thenounproject.com/noun/sd-card/#icon-No1073\r\nhttp://thenounproject.com/noun/computer/#icon-No115\r\nhttp://thenounproject.com/noun/speaker/#icon-No1898\r\nhttp://thenounproject.com/noun/television/#icon-No416\r\n\r\nAttached zip has icons flipped for etching in acrylic"
