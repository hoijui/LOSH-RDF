function: It first started out as a clip on thing for my glasses so i didnt have to wear a welding helmet (It was supposed to be printed with BLACK ABS so i wouldnt blind myself through peripheral vision). I know its not perfect but its an open source platform to attach to your glasses so you can add anything you want! My new plan is to make a monocular so i can increase my viewing distance. The opposite of Mr. Gadget when he zooms in on that piece of metal. (Insert video clip here)
