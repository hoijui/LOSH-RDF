function: "My buddy and I had a design challenge to see which one of us could design a rocket that flew the highest. As you can see by the video. It was pretty clear who the winner was. \r\n\r\nThe first rocket in the video is one i designed a long time ago and drilled out and hammered in a rocket motor http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1337 :P\r\n\r\nthe second rocket launched is designed by me aka rocket challenge.stl (or something like that)\r\n\r\nand the final rocket (launched twice) was my buddy gideon\\'s and its part X i believe.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoNc0DGa-xk"
