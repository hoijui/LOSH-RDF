function: "My second \"thing\", I built this especially for my potato cannon! I can easily get over 140 yds with just rocks! Just imagine how this will fly!! Note: Keep away from children, aim away from face!   \nI haven't printed this yet because my printer is delayed another week!!! Its shipping on Monday May 11! I'm thinking of printing this first. If anyone has their MakerBot up and running, I invite you to print this to see how it comes out and leave feedback on it so I can improve further designs."
