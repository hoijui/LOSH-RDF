function = "This box will hold all of your valuables (plans or money). It requires a toothed key to open it. I have included the important gear, the frame, the frame top, the safe part, and the key. This should be interesting to print out, I hope the overhangs will work because they are just cylindrical. My printer got shipped!!!!! This is the first thing I'm going to build! Anyone who wants to improve this design with a better gear or whatever, feel free but be sure to give Conrad2468 credit for the idea. Hope you enjoy this!\r\n\r\nUpdate: For anyone who prints this before I do, if it doesn't support the overhang I have another that you will have to drill/Dremel out. Also, The images may look like crap but once you download them they will show up alot better because thingiverse renders these things way too large"
