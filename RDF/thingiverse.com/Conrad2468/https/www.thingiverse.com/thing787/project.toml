function = "I made this because all of my test tubes constantly roll around and I didn't want to spend money on a test tube rack that takes TIME to get here!  \nNote: The holder (aka untitled) is for test tubes no larger than 2cm or 20mm in diameter. If you have larger test tubes, just scale it up in blender.   \nSide note: as soon as all of the electronics are sold assembled I'm going to start printing these!  \nUpdate: Cant fix the dryer for some reason....just make the dimensions the same for the dryer and make a 1cm diameter rod that protrudes 4cm"
