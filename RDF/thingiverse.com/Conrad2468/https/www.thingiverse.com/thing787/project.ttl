Note: The holder (aka untitled) is for test tubes no larger than 2cm or 20mm in diameter. If you have larger test tubes, just scale it up in blender.   
Side note: as soon as all of the electronics are sold assembled I'm going to start printing these!  
Update: Cant fix the dryer for some reason....just make the dimensions the same for the dryer and make a 1cm diameter rod that protrudes 4cm""" ;
