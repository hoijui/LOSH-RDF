\r
The system is currently at the "workingish" stage of development. The original draft from a year ago proved to have some major problems when I finally was able to print it, so I threw a lot of stuff from it out and focused on getting something that rolled. As a result, there are 3 non-printable parts in this thing - the balls, M3 screws left over from my makerbot assembly, M3 nuts to go with them. I printed it and it rolls alright, with a bit more play than I'm really happy with. If your tolerances are better/different from mine, you will probably get different results.""" ;
