function = "This is the first draft of a mostly printable linear bearing and a printable linear rail setup. I make no guarantees to prinability, usability, or sanity.\r\nI don't have a 3D printer, so I can't test it myself. If you try it, let me know! If you can't make it work, let me know! I'd like to make this work, so if you'd like to help me, help me help you help me help us all by telling me about it here or on the reprap forums. The non-printable part is the recirculating 6mm balls. Note on where to get them below."
