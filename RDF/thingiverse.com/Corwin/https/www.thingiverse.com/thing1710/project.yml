function: "This design is intended to use non-printed 6mm balls as rolling elements. If you don't have any, you should be able to pick up more than you will ever need at a sporting goods store under the name of Airsoft BBs. This draft has no race, if it turns out it needs one tell me and I will whip it up.\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of stl, the alt.stl files are in ASCII format and the others are in binary.\r\nNOTE: The stls are scaled so 1 unit = 1 meter. You will probably need to scale them up to be able to print."
