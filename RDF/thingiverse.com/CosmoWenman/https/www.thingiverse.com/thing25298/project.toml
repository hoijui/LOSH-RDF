This museum houses a unique collection of high quality plaster casts of all the known Parthenon sculptures.\r\n\r\nUsing a custom built structured light scanner, all of these plaster casts have been digitally scanned and assembled as 3D models. Using a systematic scanning approach, the 2,200+ scans used to assemble the meshes were acquired in five days with a team of four people. The models were subsequently aligned, merged, and decimated using the MeshAlign v.2 and MeshMerge software tools developed by the Visual Computing Group at CNR-Pisa in the framework of the EU \"ViHAP3D\" project.\"\r\nâ€¦\r\n\"Please note that these are low-res models at 10% of the scanned polygons.\"\r\n\r\n********\r\nObjects included:\r\n\r\nArtemis\r\nCaryatid\r\nDionysos\r\nIris\r\nKrekops-Pandrossos\r\n\r\nNorth Frieze\r\nSouth Frieze\r\nEast Frieze\r\nWest Frieze\r\n\r\nNorth Metope\r\nSouth Metope\r\nEast Metope\r\nWest Metope\r\n\r\n********\r\n\"The masterworks of three-dimensional art are joining the digital commons.\" â€“ Virginia Postrel, Bloomberg View, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-14/3-d-copying-makes-michelangelos-of-the-masses.html\r\n\r\n********\r\nWatch \"Through a Scanner, Getty\" youtube.com/watch?v=blKcIsEEoag\r\n\r\n********\r\nFor more objects uploaded by Cosmo Wenman, go to:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/CosmoWenman\r\n\r\nâ€¦\r\nhttp://www.cosmowenman.com\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CosmoWenman\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/CosmoWenman"
