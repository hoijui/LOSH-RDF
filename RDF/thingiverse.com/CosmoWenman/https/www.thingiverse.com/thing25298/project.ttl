From ICT's descriptions:\r
"The data for the models in this gallery was gathered from the Basel Skulpturhalle ( http://www.skulpturhalle.ch ) in Switzerland. This museum houses a unique collection of high quality plaster casts of all the known Parthenon sculptures.\r
\r
Using a custom built structured light scanner, all of these plaster casts have been digitally scanned and assembled as 3D models. Using a systematic scanning approach, the 2,200+ scans used to assemble the meshes were acquired in five days with a team of four people. The models were subsequently aligned, merged, and decimated using the MeshAlign v.2 and MeshMerge software tools developed by the Visual Computing Group at CNR-Pisa in the framework of the EU "ViHAP3D" project."\r
â€¦\r
"Please note that these are low-res models at 10% of the scanned polygons."\r
