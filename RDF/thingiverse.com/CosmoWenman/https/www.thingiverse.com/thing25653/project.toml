function = "$1 3D Scan Prize: Asteroid Surface\r\n\r\nI am sponsoring a $1 prize to be awarded to the first person to upload an original 3D scan of a 1m x 1m area of an asteroid to the Thingiverse and tag it as a derivative of this post. It needs to be scanned directly from the original, from an altitude of no more than 10 meters. Any surface from any asteroid will do; near-Earth asteroids are okay.\r\n\r\nLocation: Space\r\n\r\nSpecifications:\r\nScan Area: 1m x 1m\r\nResolution: High; 1mm x 1mm features should be visible\r\nFormat: .obj or .stl\r\nScan must be taken from an actual asteroid in solar orbit\r\nUpload must be tagged as a derivative of this post\r\n\r\nPossible Resources:\r\nhttp://twitter.com/PlanetaryRsrcs\r\nhttp://twitter.com/JimCameron\r\nhttp://twitter.com/PeterDiamandis\r\nhttp://twitter.com/EricSchmidt\r\n\r\nPurpose: I need this scan, along with a few others, for a project I'm working on.\r\n\r\nWinner will be chosen by my sole determination.\r\n\r\nOther scan prizes:\r\n- $1 Prize for 3D scan of an asteroid's surface\r\n- $1 Prize for 3D scan of Challenger Deep, Marianas Trench\r\n- $1 Prize for 3D scan of Richard Branson's beard\r\n- $1 Prize for 3D scan of Peter Diamandis\r\n\r\n********\r\n\"The masterworks of three-dimensional art are joining the digital commons.
