For art lovers, this technological moment represents a tremendous opportunityâ€¦\"\r\n\r\n\"â€¦ [A] public-spirited race for private status, with billionaire filmmakers and tech tycoons competing to outdo one another with the quality, cleverness and exoticism of the scans they sponsorâ€¦\"\r\n\r\n\"The real prestige would come â€¦ from releasing the scan to the public domain, with the sponsorâ€™s name attached. Itâ€™s a way of becoming the Medici or Carnegie of the digital era.\"\r\n\r\n â€“ Virginia Postrel via Bloomberg View http://bloom.bg/LIvH9C\r\n********\r\nFor more objects by Cosmo Wenman, go to:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/CosmoWenman\r\nâ€¦\r\nhttp://www.cosmowenman.com\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CosmoWenman\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/CosmoWenman"
