function = "\"Replica di Venere\"\r\nThe Replication of Venus\r\nwith audio: http://youtu.be/aKmJ713CIPc\r\n********\r\n\r\nCosmonaut figure as Venus on a Replicator, after Botticelli. Had to be done.\r\n\r\nArchetype meets Renaissance meets 1920's futurism meets bleeding-edge pop culture. She's getting closer and closer to stepping out into the real world.\r\n\r\n\"Î›ÎµÎ¹Ï„Î¿Ï…Ïx81Î³ÎµÎ¯ ÏƒÎµ Ï„ÏŒÏƒÎ± Ï€Î¿Î»Î»Î¬ ÎµÏ€Î¯Ï€ÎµÎ´Î±\" - Homer\r\n\r\n********\r\nThis prints pretty well on a Replicator with these settings:\r\n\r\n- Use the \"with elbow strut\" .stl variant\r\n- ABS\r\n- 75% build space (\"fill build space\" then scale 75%)\r\n- Hollow (0% infill)\r\n- No support material\r\n- Layer Height = .2\r\n- Number of shells = 1 (2 total)\r\n- Nozzle temp = 225\r\n- Platform temp = 115\r\n\r\nThe front horizontal bar of the Replicator sags a bit, but it could be sanded. The Replicator's feet curl up, but I didn't use a raft, which might help. The figure's right elbow is the only problematic overhang. Use the strut variant, then clip it off the finished print; there's no need for any other external supports. (Both versions, with and without the elbow strut, are in the .zip file)\r\n\r\n********\r\n\"The masterworks of three-dimensional art are joining the digital commons.
