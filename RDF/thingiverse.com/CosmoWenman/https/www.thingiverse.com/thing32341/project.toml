I imagine the results would be better in PLA.\r\n\r\nI've divided and oriented it so that the parts can be printed large, all at once, and without supports, on a Replicator1. As currently scaled, the assembled figure stands about 7.25\" tall.\r\n\r\nThe figure is a bit tippy: print it hollow and drop some neodymium magnets and crazy glue in its toes while it's printing.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a way to make the metalized patina finishes shown in the video and photos easily available, and easy to use. Look for Alternate Reality Patinas, http://www.AlternateRealityPatinas.com soon.\r\n\r\nCosmo Wenman\r\nhttp://cosmowenman.com (now live)\r\nhttp://twitter.com/CosmoWenman\r\n\r\n\r\n*********"
