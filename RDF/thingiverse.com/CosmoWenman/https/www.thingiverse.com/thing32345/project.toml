(I'll upload one of those here too, as soon as I figure out how to print a functional lens in clear PLA.)\r\n\r\nThe smoking figure's cigarette likely won't turn out unless you print huge - I just glued on a tiny piece of ABS filament that was hanging out of the print nozzle.\r\n\r\nObjects:\r\n- Stalking\r\n- Sniper\r\n- Supressive Fire\r\n- Smoking Kills\r\n- Busted\r\n- Rifle (extended)\r\n- Rifle (folded)\r\n\r\n+10 harmonygolds for you if the rifle looks vaguely familiar.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a way to make the metalized patina finishes shown in the video and photos easily available, and easy to use. Look for Alternate Reality Patinas, http://www.AlternateRealityPatinas.com soon.\r\n\r\nCosmo Wenman\r\nhttp://cosmowenman.com (now live)\r\nhttp://twitter.com/CosmoWenman\r\n\r\n\r\n*********"
