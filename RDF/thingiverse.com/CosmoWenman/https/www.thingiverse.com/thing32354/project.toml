For more information about this work visit:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/c/colossal_marble_lion.aspx\r\n\r\n***********\r\nThis monster waits for visitors just inside the British Museum's Great Room. It's just unbelievably huge. And it has that weird, lumpen, almost friendly quasi-human quality to its face that so many pre-photographic depictions of animals have.\r\n\r\nI've shared my AutoDesk 123D Catch scan, and an unedited .obj file. I included the .stl too, just so there'd be a cool preview image of the file here.\r\n\r\nThis file is *not* printable in its current state. Overall, it's a pretty good scan, but there are some holes in the mesh that need to be artfully repaired by hand. Once that's done, it looks to me like this is a very printable model.\r\n\r\nIf you re-export the obj file from Catch, get the texture file too: it looks great onscreen, even if you don't print it.\r\n\r\nCosmo Wenman\r\nhttp://cosmowenman.com\r\nhttp://twitter.com/CosmoWenman\r\n\r\n***********"
