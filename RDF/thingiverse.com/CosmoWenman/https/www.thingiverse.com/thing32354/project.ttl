Scanned by Cosmo Wenman using Autodesk 123D Catch at The British Museum, London, August 2012. For more information about this work visit:\r

\r
***********\r
This monster waits for visitors just inside the British Museum's Great Room. It's just unbelievably huge. And it has that weird, lumpen, almost friendly quasi-human quality to its face that so many pre-photographic depictions of animals have.\r
\r
I've shared my AutoDesk 123D Catch scan, and an unedited .obj file. I included the .stl too, just so there'd be a cool preview image of the file here.\r
\r
This file is *not* printable in its current state. Overall, it's a pretty good scan, but there are some holes in the mesh that need to be artfully repaired by hand. Once that's done, it looks to me like this is a very printable model.\r
\r
If you re-export the obj file from Catch, get the texture file too: it looks great onscreen, even if you don't print it.\r
