function: "From the British Museum\r\n\r\nScanned by Cosmo Wenman, http://cosmowenman.com\r\n\r\nRoman, 2nd century AD\r\nSaid to be from Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, Lazio, Italy\r\n\r\nHeight: 58.500 cm\r\nMedium: Marble\r\n\r\nBritish Museum Object Number: GR 1805.7-3.91\r\n\r\nThe Athenian politician\r\n\r\n***********\r\n\r\nScanned by Cosmo Wenman using Autodesk 123D Catch at The British Museum, London, August 2012. For more information about this work visit:\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles_with_the_Corinthian_helmet\r\n\r\n***********\r\n\r\nFrom the British Museum:\r\n\r\n\"Perikles (died 429 BC) led the democracy of Athens at the height of the city's power and influence. He gathered around him a circle of poets, architects and artists, whose works include a programme of renewal of the principal religious and civic buildings of Athens. The crowning glory was the Parthenon, erected on the Acropolis between 447 and 432 BC. Perikles was famous for the power of his oratory (public speaking) that enabled him to rule Athens almost without opposition.\r\n\r\nThis is a Roman copy of an original portrait which was perhaps created in Perikles' own day, or shortly after his death. However, it probably bears little physical resemblance to Perikles' actual appearance, showing an ideal type of the mature soldier citizen, wearing a helmet pushed back on his head.\r\n\r\nThe portrait is shaped as a 'terminal bust' for mounting on a square shaft of stone. It is said to come from the Roman emperor Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, near Rome. It was later part of the collection of Charles Townley.\"\r\n\r\n*****************\r\n\r\nI've uploaded my 123D Catch file. I haven't been able to coax very good results out of Catch for this piece. I don't know why, but it's turning out lumpy. I photographed pretty good coverage of it from all angles, with good lighting too. Maybe you'll have better luck processing the file than I did.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded an .stl and .obj file too. The .stl file is *not* printable - there are some holes in the mesh. But I included it so there'd be a file-preview rendered, so you can see this guy's epic beard and awesome hat.\r\n\r\nIf someone can mange to clean this one up, it would make for a pretty straightforward print, and would look cool even in miniature.\r\n\r\nCosmo Wenman\r\nhttp://cosmowenman.com\r\nhttp://twitter.com/CosmoWenman"
