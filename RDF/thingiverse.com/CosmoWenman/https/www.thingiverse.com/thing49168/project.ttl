Scanned from the original in the Louvre by Cosmo Wenman. Part of my series "3D Printed Portraiture: Past, Present, and Future," www.cosmowenman.com/3DPPPPF.html, shown at the MakerBot exhibit at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, 2013.  \r

From *"Faces of Power: Alexander's Image and Hellenistic Politics"* by Andrew Stewart:  \r
\r
\r
*"It is clear that in antiquity Alexander was a chameleonlike figure indeed, more a paradigm than a person. For not only was his own character multifaceted and contradictory, but his achievements evoked wildly divergent and contradictory responses from those whom it touched. So he swiftly became a cliché or rather a set of clichés or* topoi *to be evoked in images that are wildly divergent in character, quality, type, provenance, date, and, apparently, purpose.*  \r
\r
*All this points less to a Hellenistic and Roman "portrait" of Alexander than to a complex and multifarious use of his image and its attendant connotations that extended over many centuries. His face was the most influential in history."*  \r
\r
\r
Originally thought to represent the Cycladic river god Inopos, the nearly one meter tall fragmented bust known as *The Inopos* is now accepted as a portrait of Alexander the Great. If the full figure had survived intact, it would stand at well over eight feet tall--god scale. At the Louvre, the imposing, larger-than-life figure hides in plain sight, largely unnoticed, staring down at the crowds that flock to see the *Venus de Milo* just twenty feet away (compare the photos from the Louvre and CES).  \r
\r
\r
\r
I scanned the original in the Louvre in October 2012 using Autodesk 123D Catch. Using Blender, I digitally restored its damaged nose using a nose I scanned from a portrait of Alexander at the British Museum. I printed the piece full-scale in PLA on a MakerBot Replicator2 and reinvented the print in weathered bronze with Alternate Reality Patinas ( http://AlternateRealityPatinas.com coming soon!).  \r
