function: "**Collossal Bust of Alexander the Great, known as \"The Inopos\", circa 100 B.C.**  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScanned from the original in the Louvre by Cosmo Wenman. Part of my series \"3D Printed Portraiture: Past, Present, and Future,\" www.cosmowenman.com/3DPPPPF.html, shown at the MakerBot exhibit at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, 2013.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom *\"Faces of Power: Alexander's Image and Hellenistic Politics\"* by Andrew Stewart:  \r\n\r\n\r\n*\"It is clear that in antiquity Alexander was a chameleonlike figure indeed, more a paradigm than a person. For not only was his own character multifaceted and contradictory, but his achievements evoked wildly divergent and contradictory responses from those whom it touched. So he swiftly became a clich\xE9 or rather a set of clich\xE9s or* topoi *to be evoked in images that are wildly divergent in character, quality, type, provenance, date, and, apparently, purpose.*  \r\n\r\n*All this points less to a Hellenistic and Roman \"portrait\" of Alexander than to a complex and multifarious use of his image and its attendant connotations that extended over many centuries. His face was the most influential in history.\"*  \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally thought to represent the Cycladic river god Inopos, the nearly one meter tall fragmented bust known as *The Inopos* is now accepted as a portrait of Alexander the Great. If the full figure had survived intact, it would stand at well over eight feet tall--god scale. At the Louvre, the imposing, larger-than-life figure hides in plain sight, largely unnoticed, staring down at the crowds that flock to see the *Venus de Milo* just twenty feet away (compare the photos from the Louvre and CES).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI scanned the original in the Louvre in October 2012 using Autodesk 123D Catch. Using Blender, I digitally restored its damaged nose using a nose I scanned from a portrait of Alexander at the British Museum. I printed the piece full-scale in PLA on a MakerBot Replicator2 and reinvented the print in weathered bronze with Alternate Reality Patinas ( http://AlternateRealityPatinas.com coming soon!).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Louvre's entry for this piece: http://louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/bust-alexander-great-known-inopos  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--Cosmo Wenman  \r\n[cosmowenman.com](http://www/cosmowenman.com)  \r\n[twitter.com/CosmoWenman](http://www.twitter.com/CosmoWenman)"
