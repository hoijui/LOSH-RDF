function: "Scanned at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Part of my series \"3D Printed Portraiture: Past, Present, and Future,\" cosmowenman.com/3DPPPPF.html, shown at the MakerBot exhibit at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, 2013.\r\n\r\nAlbert Einstein sat for sculptor Jacob Epstein in Britain in 1933, while a refugee from Nazi Germany. Epstein described Einstein's \"wild hair floating in the wind\" and wrote that \"his glance contained a mixture of the humane, the humorous, and the profound.\"\r\n\r\nI scanned a cast of Epstein's bronze portrait in August 2012 in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, where it is displayed in a gallery where visitors are encouraged to touch the artwork. I used Autodesk 123D Catch to make the scan. I printed the piece in PLA with a MakerBot Replicator and finished it in bronze with Alternate Reality Patinas.\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at the outright duplication of a sculpture scanned in situ in a museum, and I am pleased with the result. My scan captured the rough volume of the features' broader strokes, though not all their individual contours. More time photographing and better lighting would certainly yield a more faithful model.\r\n\r\nThis subject may be a bit of a cheat, though; Epstein's loose style is particularly forgiving, and the nearly uniform, dark bronze patina is pretty straightforward to approximate. And, of course, Einstein's iconic face is so memorable and easily recognizable. His spark leaps through any medium.\r\n\r\n- Cosmo Wenman\r\ncosmowenman.com\r\ntwitter.com/CosmoWenman"
