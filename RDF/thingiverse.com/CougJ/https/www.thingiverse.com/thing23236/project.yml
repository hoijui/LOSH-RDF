function: I made these free hand in Sketchup 8, for my 5 year old. I do not, yet, have a 3D printer so I can't give you instructions how to print them. This is the first thing I have ever exported as STL so I have no idea how it turned out, SKP file included. I would love to see photos if somebody prints them. Cheers.
