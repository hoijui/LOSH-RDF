function: "I make a lot of projects that use 3/8\" aluminum tubing and one of the things I hate is that it is sold on 50ft. rolls.  Which doesn't help much if you need straight pieces.  So I made this roller to be part of a 3D printed tubing straightner.  However, the base undured too much strees and flexed too much to make a usable tool.  So I wound up using a piece of 3/4\" plywood.  This works better than anything that I have tried up to this point.  It still leaves an ever so slight arc in a 3ft piece of tubing, but it can easily be worked out by hand, or by rotating the tubing in the rollers while you move it back an forth.\r\n\r\nThis roller can also be used for other 3/8\" tubing and rod projects, so I decided to put it on Thingiverse to see what others make of it."
