function = "I needed a battery box for 3 AA batteries for a 3.3V micro processor project.  Uses #6 nuts and has holes for 1/4\" #6 bolts.  The holes are not need but are there if you need to use them for the bolts.  The batteries will have a tight fit, but after you insert the batteries a few times, it will push the nuts into the holes.  I found that the bolts were not needed at all after I had printed it, but makes for a clean wire connection.  Also, if you can get away without using the bolts, you will not have exposed battery contacts to the outside of the box."
