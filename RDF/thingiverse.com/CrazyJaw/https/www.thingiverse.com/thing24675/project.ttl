    okh:function """Based on Emmett's ever popular gear heart: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12208\r
\r
This version is about half the width of the original (50 mm), which means its 1/8 the volume and a much faster print (yay math!). i find it takes me ~2 hours to print one (and ~8 for the original)\r
\r
Rather than just being a straight scaling, this version has been tweaked so taht it will still rotate. The main differences are the number of gear teeth (much fewer, and larger), gear ratio (it now takes 2 rotations to realign, unfortunately) and pins (made much beefier, and they are all one length).\r
\r
Additionally, there is a hole through the tip so that it can serve as a keychain! Print them out by the dozen and give them to friends/family/cute girls on the bus!\r
\r
== Edit 6/10/2012 ==\r
Added a zip of the source plus .stls for every individual component. \r
\r
Added a "full plate" that prints all the gears + center. Left the pins out, since you usually want to print those with different settings. Fits on a replicator (not sure about others...)\r
\r
== Edit 6/16/2012 ==\r
Added a chain connector to gear1 (the top). Updated the src rar (and fixed a compilation bug).\r
\r
== Edit 6/19/2012 ==\r
Fixed the length of the pins. Shorted now, so gears should be less wobbly.""" ;
