function: "I am constantly chipping fan blades (gone through about 3 replacements). \r\n\r\nGaryacrowellsr's fan guard is great, however since i have to remove it before i unscrew the fan, it doesn't protect against the situation that has killed most of my fans! (namely, accidentally jamming a allen wrench in there when i am doing a quick cleaning job). \r\n\r\nThis version is split, and features screw holes, so it can basically live on the fan without ever being taken off.\r\n\r\nPlus, along with http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28241, the extruder kinda looks like a face.\r\n\r\nAlso refactored the original scad source to be a little easier to modify"
