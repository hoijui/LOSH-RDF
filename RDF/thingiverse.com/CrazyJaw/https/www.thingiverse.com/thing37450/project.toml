function = "Few things stress me out more than trying to line up both sides of kapton tape for the Replicator HPB.  Doing it by hand always takes me a dozen tries and 20 minutes to get it flat, creaseless, and without overlaps or gaps. \r\n\r\nHowever most jigs i found either weren't printable, or weren't particularly helpful. This little guy is easy to print and easy to use."
