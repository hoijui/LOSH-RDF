function: "This is a Puzzle box I attempted to build from plans I found. \r\n\r\nhttp://homepage.ntlworld.com/bruce.viney/The%20Matchbox%20T-plans.pdf\r\n\r\nI was tempted to see if i could replicate the design on my printer. I still have a long ways to go. I do not recommend printing this, at the moment there is sizing issues that I have to take into account. It took me a very long time to clean and cut away at certain areas to fit together certain pieces and in the end it exploded in my hands under pressure(do not attempt to push objects together if they don't fit....). I just wanted to post it as a in progress design."
