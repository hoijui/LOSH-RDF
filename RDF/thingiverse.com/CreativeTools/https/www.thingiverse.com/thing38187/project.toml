function = "This casing is a variation of MakerBot's own acrylic casing for the Replicator 1 3D printer. The adaptation makes it easier to open and close the front lid as well as detach it entirely. Some 3D printed parts are used as handles and fastening of the panels and lid.  \nThe use of this casing reduces 3D printing noise and provides a more stable and controllable temperature of the internal environment. Connection to a fan on the rear can be used to lead gases out of the 3D printer.  \nhttp://www.creativetools.se/casing-for-makerbot-replicator-1-3d-printer  \n\nBy Creative Tools  \n-       \n[Home](http://Creative-Tools.com \"Official homepage of Creative Tools\") - [Things](http://www.thingiverse.com/CreativeTools/designs \"Creative Tools' Thingiverse 3D-printable files\") - [GooglePlus](http://google.com/+CreativetoolsSe \"Creative Tools' Google Plus page\") - [Twitter](http://twitter.com/CreativeTools \"Creative Tools' Twitter page\") - [Facebook](http://facebook.com/creativetools \"Creative Tools' Facebook page\") - [Youtube](http://youtube.com/creativetools \"Creative Tools' Youtube Channel\") - [Instructables](http://instructables.com/member/CreativeTools \"Creative Tools' Instructables\") - [Instagram](http://instagram.com/creative_tools \"Creative Tools' Instagram\") - [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/creative_tools/ \"Creative Tools' Flickr photo stream\") - [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/creativetools/videos \"Creative Tools' Vimeo videos\") - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/creative-tools \"Creative Tools' LinkedIn company page\")  \nMakerBots original casing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18813"
