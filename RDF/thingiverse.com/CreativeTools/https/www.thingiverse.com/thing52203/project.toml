function = "This small device traps dust in a small sponge before it enters the extruder. In some cases it can also be used to easily lubricate the filament just before it is extruded.  \r\nThe adapter is designed to fit the Replicator (1), Replicator 2 and Replicator 2X extruders.  \r\nProtecting your 3D printer's extruder from foreign particles is an important part of keeping the machine maintenance-free. This adapter makes it easy to keep the filament clean.   \r\n\r\nRelated thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:492067  \r\n\r\n---  \r\n####By Creative Tools    \r\n[Home](http://Creative-Tools.com) - [Youtube](http://youtube.com/creativetools) - [Things](http://www.thingiverse.com/CreativeTools/designs) - [#3DBenchy](http://www.3DBenchy.com) - [GooglePlus](http://google.com/+CreativetoolsSe) - [Twitter](http://twitter.com/CreativeTools) - [Facebook](http://facebook.com/creativetools) - [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/member/CreativeTools?show=INSTRUCTABLES) - [Instagram](http://instagram.com/creative_tools) - [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/creativetools) - [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/creative_tools/) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/creative-tools)"
