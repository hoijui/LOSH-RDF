function = "Copied PaulRac's fan mount design (from scratch) and adjusted it to mount a 30mm fan. Also improved it so the hot end does not need to be removed to mount it.\r\n\r\nGuarenteed to fit on a Printrbot LC wooden extruder with a 30mm fan. This mount is thin enough such that the stock extruder mount screws will work.\r\n\r\nVolume: .25 cubic inches\r\nABS Weight: .01 pounds"
