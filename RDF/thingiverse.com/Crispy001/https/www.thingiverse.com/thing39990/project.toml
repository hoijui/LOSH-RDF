function = "Enclosure tailored for an official Arduino Leonardo. 1/8\" thick walls give it some strength and versatility. The bottom of the case has the words ARDUINO cutout for style.  \n\nI left some extra space around the micro USB port so the Leonardo can be plugged in while in the enclosure.  \n\nA lid is....not coming!  \n\nVolume: 1.17 cubic inches  \nABS Weight: .04 pounds"
