function = "FreeTrack is an open source software application that provides cost effective optical head tracking for applications & games. This software closely emulates its commercial counterpart, TrackIR.\r\n\r\nThe headtracking is achieved by attaching infrared LEDs to a hat or clip in a special arrangement and then allowing the software to track these points through almost any webcam. This position data will then be provided to a game in real time such as ARMA II or DCS: World, allowing the user to freely look around their envionment.\r\n\r\nThis point model serves as a precise platform for mounting the infrared LEDs to a hat. The relative positions of these LEDs must be entered in the software, and less precise or changing measurements means lower performance for the user.\r\n\r\nAdditional information available at the FreeTrack website: http://www.free-track.net/english/\r\n\r\nVolume: .89 cubic inches\r\nABS Weight: .03 pounds"
