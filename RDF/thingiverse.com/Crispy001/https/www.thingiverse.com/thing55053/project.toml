function = "These Z stabilizers reduce the amount of Z wobble by providing additional support to the Z axis smooth rods. Additionally, they are fully compatible with my popular bed stabilizer upgrade found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:43200\r\n\r\nWorks quite well too!\r\n\r\nDesigned and tested for a Printrbot LC, a Printrbot Plus version has also been made to accommodate 12mm rods, though it is untested. Please comment if it works for you!\r\n\r\nThe standard size is .25\" thick and the low profile version is slightly thinner at .20\". If your printing surface isn't raised by glass or leveling screws, use the low profile version.\r\n\r\nVolume: .4 cubic inches\r\nABS Weight: .01 pounds"
