function = "The Roomba 700 bumper has a rubber coating, but only on the bottom half. \r\nIf you have furniture with a bottom space of 6 to 8 cm the Roomba will bump into the furniture full speed because the distance sensors are placed lower and will look below the furniture.\r\nThese two strips replace the standard strip that is on top of the Roomba 700 bumper and has a flat surface to put a rubber strip on."
