function = "After adjusting the tension on the X-axis belt for the zillionth time (to loose = lash, to tight = motor skip), I designed this little tension clamp.\r\n\r\nThe clamp consists of 2 parts: one goes onto the carriage with the original 2x40mm bolts. The other part gets clamped on the belt with 2x20mm M4 bolts and 2 nuts. The 2 parts are joined with an 55mm M4 bolt and M4 nylok.\r\n\r\nAfter putting everything together, its a matter of tensioning a single bolt to modify the tension on the belt.\r\n\r\nNo more unscrewing and re-fastening over and over again!\r\n\r\nNote: The orientation of the belt with this design is for the alternative X-axis where the teeth of the belt point inwards.\r\n\r\nNote 2: Photos of all parts plus mounted on the Mendel will come soon."
