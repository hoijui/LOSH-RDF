But when I saw \"MakeALot\" hack http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18074 I think this may fit perfect with it.\r\nAs I said this is this is not complete and needs somemore work. But since I am not willing to go as far as \"MakeALot\" I will leave the rest of the work up to you guys and girls. Monday or Tuesday I will have somemore files on the wider plate for this. \r\n\r\nP.S. I have added a zip file with all of the stl and sketchup files.\r\nThere is no 693 bearings option since free sketchup sucks."
