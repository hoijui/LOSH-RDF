If you are willing to go as fair as "MakeALot" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18074\r
This with somemore work may give you up to 40mm+ on the "X" with a the standard TOM carriage.\r
It nowhere near done and I had put this to the side after I tested it with a wider plate and found there was not a lot of room for a wide build platform. But when I saw "MakeALot" hack http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18074 I think this may fit perfect with it.\r
As I said this is this is not complete and needs somemore work. But since I am not willing to go as far as "MakeALot" I will leave the rest of the work up to you guys and girls. Monday or Tuesday I will have somemore files on the wider plate for this. \r
\r
P.S. I have added a zip file with all of the stl and sketchup files.\r
There is no 693 bearings option since free sketchup sucks.""" ;
