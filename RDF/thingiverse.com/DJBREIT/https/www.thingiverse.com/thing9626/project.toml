One has.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14747\r\n\r\n\r\nItâ€™s been a month since I bout my Thing-O-Matic (TOM). After the first two weeks the belt on my Automatic Build Platform (ABP) was pretty warped from all the stuff I was printing.\r\nSo I wanted to be able to place the Heat Build Platform (HBP) on it and save the belts on the ABP. But it was a pain to change them out. The few examples I did find here ether required you to cut into your brand new TOM or buy some new parts. So I made my own setup. The requirement was to stick with the original part that came with TOM and not to slice and dice any of the parts up. (Since you never know when someone else comes along with a better mouse trap}\r\nThis is the design I came up with it reuses all of the original part except a second heat platform http://store.makerbot.com/makerbot-thingomatic-heater-board-v1-1.html . Unless you decide to use the non-heated platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have left the \"work in progress\" on since I think this can have some more improvements. Like something better then the clamps I used on it.\r\n\r\nThis should save on the belts on the ABP. \r\n\r\nUpDate\r\nIf you already put one together and there are no problems with it then  there is no need to print them out again.\r\n\r\nAll I did was clean up the models. I also added a derivative of the roller bearing option for thaws who need or want it.\r\nFor more info on that go to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8625"
