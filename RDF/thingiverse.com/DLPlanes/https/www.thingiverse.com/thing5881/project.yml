function: "Do you have a GoPro? Do you have a MakerBot? If you answered yes to both of these question continue reading.\r\n If you answered no to either leave!

But those mounts are expensive, so I decided to build my own mount, and it works great, total cost its less then a $1. \r\n -Look at the pictures below, there is one where you can see the mount, clearly-"
