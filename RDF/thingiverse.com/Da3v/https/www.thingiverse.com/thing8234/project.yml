function: "The PlugNLearn Sensor Hub was designed by TomLong74 to implement the Sensing Platform (http://sensingplatform.org)and to be a reference implementation for makers and educators to build upon. The PlugNLearn device provides a ready to use, open source sensor network which can be used in the classroom, laboratory, or anywhere else you might take it. The device is portable, using a lithium ion battery for power, and can receive readings from up to six discrete sensors attached via standard network cable (CAT5 + RJ45).\r\n\r\nThe PlugNLearn device consists of a hub, shaped like a large RJ45 connector that has a number of actual RJ45 connectors to attach sensor nodes called \xE2\u20AC\u0153SenseAbles\xE2\u20AC\x9D"
