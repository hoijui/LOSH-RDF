function = "I'm making extensive use of OpenSCAD. The only problem I found is that the polygon function is hard to use. I rather draw my polygons visual. So I created a simple polygon editor for OpenSCAD in Javascript+HTML.\r\n\r\nFollowing the idea from the \"OpenScad Polygon Generator\" by \"PieterBos\" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9290\r\nBut then working for any OS, any browser, without fuss. You don't even need to install anything! (might even work in mobile browsers)\r\n\r\nOnline version can be found at:\r\nhttp://daid.mine.nu/~daid/3d/\r\nLatest sources can be found at:\r\nhttps://github.com/daid/OpenSCAD-polygon-editor"
