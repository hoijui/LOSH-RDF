function = "It's planet gears in a key hanger with a cat theme.\r\nIt's cute and fun to play with. It's also hard to print it.\r\n\r\nIt was inspired by my cat, and the screwless cube gears that people always like to play with. And someone totaly energic about the cube gears print.\r\nI wanted something that people could still play with and be inspired by, but that would also fit in your pocket."
