function = "I wanted to be able to tension my Y belt without having to work underneath the machine, so I decided to try adding a tensioner to the Y end idler. I have this mounted on my MendelMax and it seems to work very well. In fact you have to be careful not to over tighten it.\r\n\r\nEdit, March 1, 2012\r\n\r\nI fixed the mounts with the ridge by eliminating the ridge around and above the hole."
