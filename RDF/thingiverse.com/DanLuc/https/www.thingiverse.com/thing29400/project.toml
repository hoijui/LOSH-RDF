function = "This is a dust cap for a DFM12 Festo pneumatic actuator.   \n\nIf installed as seen in the pictures there is allot of dust that accumulates inside the guide rods. Eventually the brass bushings inside go bad. So this is an easy way to address the problem.  \n\nUpdate Jan 2015:  \nI made another dust cap that has a lip going around the actuator to help with splash as well."
