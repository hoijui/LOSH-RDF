function = "Just a little knob to help you open the doors, drawers and whatever else you need.  \nThe known stick out about an inch or so, and just under an inch wide. They are a simple design that can be modified quickly should you have the need or the Solid Works software.  \nUPDATE!!!! 11/10.2013  \nSo I nboticed that on good printers the hole comes out oversized for M4. On my Ultimaker it was just right for self taping. I adjusted the hole to the M4 tap drill size so All you would need to do is tap the hole and way you go."
