The known stick out about an inch or so, and just under an inch wide. They are a simple design that can be modified quickly should you have the need or the Solid Works software.  
UPDATE!!!! 11/10.2013  
So I nboticed that on good printers the hole comes out oversized for M4. On my Ultimaker it was just right for self taping. I adjusted the hole to the M4 tap drill size so All you would need to do is tap the hole and way you go.""" ;
