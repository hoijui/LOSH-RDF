function: "I'll start off with the fact that I had quite a hard time finding a Name for this thing. \r\n\r\nIt's basically an adapter, which lets you reconfigure the Pins of any 28 Pin DIP-IC (I use it for the Atmega8), in an already existing system. You can put the controller (or whatever thingy you have there) on a breadboard, and plug the System Access Gadget (SAG)into the controllers socket on your circuit board. Then you just wire up the pins, and reconfigure them as you please (ad something, leave something out). \r\nThe Second part is basically a comb to keep your cables in line, and I made it a bit bigger so you can label the pins with a CD-Marker. This way you can put pretty long cables on it, without having to trace every single one from the very root when you want to wire up the other end. \r\n\r\nIt helped me a great deal, so I thought I put it up for everyone. \r\nJust in case I'm not the only one who etches his circuits a bit prematurely. \r\n\r\nIf you find it useful, please leave a comment."
