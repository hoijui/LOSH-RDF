function = "This is a vise for fixing printed circuit boards (PCBs) on machine tables. it consists of two L-shaped pieces, which are meant to be clamped on two diagonally opposite corners of your PCB (see pictures). The long slots are made for M10 Hex Socket screws, for smaller ones you might have to use washers or modify the design.\r\nThe sides have a 0.75mm high wall built in, to enable accurate positioning of the Boards. \r\nThe short side of the L-shapes has two holes (22mm apart) , enabling you to screw on an additional plate to align one of the clamps with your machine table's edge. \r\n\r\nSince I usually drill/cut my PCBs on my mill, I got a little fed up with using the thick clamping jaws usually used for fixing metal objects on the cross-slide. The small drills used for PCBs are so short that I had more than a few collisions with my drilling chuck and the jaws whenever I was drilling holes close to them, so I made this thing. \r\nI intentionally left plenty of space under the clamp, so the drills won't directly go into your table. \r\n\r\nHope someone finds it useful.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk."
