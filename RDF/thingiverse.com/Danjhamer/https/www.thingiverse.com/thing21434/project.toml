function = "I have a Prusa Mendel Longboat. It has an aluminium X carriage and J head nozzle hot end. I couldnâ€™t find a duct that would fit so hereâ€™s my version to fit the Longboat.\r\nIf accommodates a 40mm x 40mm fan and will clamp on to the edge of the aluminium plate.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve also designed a MOSFET controller to control the fan using a Sanguinololu with Sprinter firmware.\r\nSchematics, instructions and firmware modifications to follow.\r\nUPDATE: \r\nSee http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22202"
