function: My friend had a backgammon board commissioned here in Dar es Salaam.  Unfortunately, her large wooden dice were gouging her board.  So, on her birthday, I coincidentally got my 3D printer up and running, and decided to design and build these dice for her, which my wife painted with white nail polish.
