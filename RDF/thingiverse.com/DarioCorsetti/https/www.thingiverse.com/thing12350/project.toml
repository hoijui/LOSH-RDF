function = "Going in a new home I needed to add some shelf to the new wardrobe. So I designed a support that can be printed with a RepRap. \r\nThe support is made for fit on a screw head and hide it.\r\n\r\nI inserted an image to show OpenSCAD parameters meaning and one example STL file.\r\nThe STL file is just good for my particular screws and RepRap, use it only to make an idea: you have to tune the parameters to your specific needs!\r\n\r\nFull design story and more details on my blog:\r\nhttp://www.resco-research.com/blog/tutorial-design/design-story-1-shelf-supports"
