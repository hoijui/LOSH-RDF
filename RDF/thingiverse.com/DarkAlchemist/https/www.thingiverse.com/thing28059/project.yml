function: Just my Wally world coaster I use at home only this one has a solid bottom.  The dimensions are as accurate as my ruler would allow (will get calipers soonish) from the real world object.  This has a very fine mesh so you may print it with whatever quality you would like BUT you must furnish the 80-84mm round thin cork to put into the inner 85mm hole for your drinking glass to go on. :)
