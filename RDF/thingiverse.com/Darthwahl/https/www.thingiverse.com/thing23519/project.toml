function = "\"Such is a dream of light,\r\nBut to float upon a sea of clouds\"\r\n\r\nAn idea I've been toying with for the better part of 3 years now, I have finally realized in a printable sculpture. This Is my lighthouse poised on a floating island. I made it for Mother's Day so as to give my mom a gift that was from a personal place, while making new use of an old trope: isolation of the lighthouse. \r\n\r\nI made the original file in sketchup, and have included the file for your use. Please enjoy."
