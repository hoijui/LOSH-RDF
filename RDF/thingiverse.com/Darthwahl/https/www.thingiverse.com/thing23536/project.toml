function = "Upon seeing tachyio's Deus Ex inspired prints, I was inspired to expand the same basic principle into usable lighting solutions. This is a scaled mock-up of a wall sconce that will eventually be 1.5' x 1.5' lit with low-energy consuming LEDs. I only wanted to see what the physical object would look like. so I modeled and printed it. the model itself could probably be used as a coaster for your favorite techno-punk beverage.\r\n\r\nI will post more on my progress with the sconce as it materializes."
