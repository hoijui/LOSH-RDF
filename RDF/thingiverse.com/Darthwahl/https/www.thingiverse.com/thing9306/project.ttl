\r
You ever heard of Regretsy.com? If you haven't , I suggest going there (no worries, it's not dirty). Basic premise, It showcases the most hideously awful things on the website Etsy.com. (a site where people sell handmade crafts or vintage things). Regretsy is owned and is maintained by April Winchell (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Winchell). One of the categories under which she files certain awful creations is titled "Whimsicle F*ckery" minus the asterisk. Well, She ordered a laser-cut necklace of the phrase and needless to say, it's awesome. So here is a printable version of that necklace pendant. Makes a great gift!""" ;
