Well, I have had that happen a few times, and it sucks, so I made a printable holder that you can simply clip the arduino into. \r
\r
I'm thinking of adding onto this project and making project cases that this slides into, or battery holders, or robot legs. Hell, I don't know, with this technology practically anything is possible.\r
\r
EDIT: I have added a .3DS and .SKP version as well, so if you see ways to upgrade it or want to modify it to better fit your own project, please feel free to do so!""" ;
