function = "I replaced all of the rods of my original printrbot with 50cm rods and replaced the T5 belts with longer GT2 belts and pulleys.  \nPlus some changed details.  \nNew build platform is now over 30 x 30 cm, and still printing nice. I have not testet all the limits yet, must add some feet to the base or it will tip over with big prints.  \nUPDATE 26.03.2013  \nExperiences so far: It's louder than before, can't leave it printing during the night or my neighbours will kill me... it's building up more vibrations, also sortof a y-wobble. Most of this is probably because of lm8uu bearings with missing balls but the whole construction needs to be stiffened. If I had more space I would build a massive wooden frame around it.   \nUPDATE 24.04.2013  \nReplaced the Base with Japica 608 Base, runs much smoother now"
