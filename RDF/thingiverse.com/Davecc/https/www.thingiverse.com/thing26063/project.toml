function = "This is my newly designed and built Makerbot Replicator Enclosure that does not require a laser cutter to make.  It can be built using your Makerbot Replicator, a band saw, drill press, and one screw driver for assembly.  It uses 1/4 inch thick acrylic plastic for all the clear parts so that it will not sag because it is to light weight for the sizes that are needed.  It cost less than half of what it would be to have the parts laser cut for you. The top hood and front window opening are easily removed in seconds without tools so it is simple to access the Makerbot when you want to make adjustments, print a part or remove finished parts."
