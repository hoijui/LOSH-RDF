    okh:function """A mounting solution for attaching GoPro cameras to the Solidoodle printer (gen 2). The plate can be latched to either the top front frame or the side front side frame. Makes taking videos or timelapses of the building process easier.\r
\r
There are two versions available:\r
\r
1. Screw mount - Allows you to attach the GoPro to the plate using standard M5 GoPro screws. A nut is required. \r
\r
2. Slide / Snap mount - Allows you to the attach the GoPro to the plate using the standard GoPro snap legs. Same as with the standard mounts. \r
\r
* The snap mount is a work in progress. Need to tweak the dimensions a bit.\r
\r
Both versions are supplied in two formats.\r
One is a complete, solid assembly that can be printed in one piece. It requires printing with support material but should be a bit sturdier.\r
The second version is with the plate and mount(s) in different files for separated printing. This requires attaching them together with acetone. \r
\r
Sample footage using the mount: http://vimeo.com/gingerskull/gopro-solidoodle-mount-test\r
\r
UPDATE: Added the slide mount. As with the first version, there is a standalone mount and a combined mount.\r
\r
NOTE: I made this for the Solidoodle 2 frame. I don't know if the original Solidoodle or the upcoming Solidoodle 3 have the same frame dimensions or not.""" ;
