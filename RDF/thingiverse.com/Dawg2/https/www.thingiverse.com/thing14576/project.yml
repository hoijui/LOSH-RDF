function: "Inspiration for this thing came from the Folding Wood Booklet by SNIJLAB found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12707\r\n\r\nAs soon as saw the Folding Woob Booklet on Thingiverse I knew that design had lots of potential. Around the same time when I found the SNIJLAB design I was searching for ideas to make an iPhone 4 Case and thought this would be perfect. \r\n\r\nI wanted the finished case to resemble a moleskine note book and I think I came pretty close. \r\n\r\n\r\nCut on an Epilog mini 40Watt laser"
