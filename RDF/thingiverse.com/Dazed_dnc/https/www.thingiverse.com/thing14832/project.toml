It helps if you can keep the \"branches\" from cooling too much while it loops them around. If they go stiff too fast, then the branches don't droop down enough and it ruins the effect.\r\n\r\nI had to slow my printer down to 20mm/s to avoid serial port errors causing it to crash, which of course allows the branches to cool too much before letting them drop. Putting a towel over the printer helped trap the heat, but I think it looks better if you can print it at around 35-50mm/s"
