function = "This set uses units (unit size varies from piece to piece) to represent the spaces a piece can move. In the case of the knight, bishop, and queen the units represent the directions the piece can move but not the number of spaces.  In the center of each piece is also the point value of the piece.  This was my first attempt at TinkerCad so please feel free to suggest improvements to my technique.  Thanks!"
