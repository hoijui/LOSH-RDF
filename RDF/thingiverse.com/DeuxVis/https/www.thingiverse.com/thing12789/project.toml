function = "This is an extruder gears set for the TechZone Huxley extruder, featuring herringbone teeth.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to replace the 2 lasercut wooden gears. I printed one set but haven't mounted it yet - I'm waiting for the original gears to break or wear first.\r\n\r\nThis use 2 modules from the MCAD library that you can get from https://github.com/elmom/MCAD - Thanks to the authors.\r\nSome bits - the motor gear mount hub with set screw hole - are derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3104 (thanks GilesBathgate) which is under GPL CC license."
