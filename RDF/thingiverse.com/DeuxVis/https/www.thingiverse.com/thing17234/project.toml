function = "A pair of replacements clamps to retain your Techzone Huxley bowden cable using 6-R1/8 straight push-fit pneumatic fast connectors.\r\n\r\nAll my attempts to retain my ptfe bowden cable before that turned into a failure sooner or later. Now that I use those, I have zero trouble, and it's sooo helpfull for filament unloading/reloading to be able to quickly disconnect the bowden tubing.\r\n\r\nIdea came from the ultimaker machine."
