function = "After a while the original Techzone Huxley X carriage with a single bronze bushing started to get sticky, despite of any oil I fed it. It created some massive backlash on the X axis, so I designed this :\r\n\r\n\r\nUsed to replace the original single bronze bushing X axis carriage with 3 LM6UU linear bearings.\r\n\r\nIncludes holes for mounting a better attached hotend (with a peek block retaining the nozzle).\r\n\r\nParts needed :\r\n  - 1 printed X carriage (this file).\r\n  - 3 x LM6UU\r\n  - 2 x 6mm smooth rods, length 300mm (to replace non-metric original techzone X rods).\r\n\r\nBased on PRUSA Mendel X-carriage by Josef PrÅ¯Å¡a\r\n\r\nThe Openscad file, along with any dependencies needed, is in the zip archive.\r\n\r\n*** UPDATE *** \r\nAdded ziptie holes to secure the linear bearings."
