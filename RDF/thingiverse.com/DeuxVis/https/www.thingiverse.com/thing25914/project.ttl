\r
This is an accessory for the Ultimaker extruder update by ghagen01 rather than a derivative.\r
\r
It is needed if you have produced a 50materialwheel part without threading on its shaft - printed at shapeways in steel for instance, rather than machined.\r
\r
By the way I uploaded the 2 metal parts on shapeways :\r

\r
Update :\r
V2 is beefier (previous version was prone to flexing) and has better designed nut holes (nuts were tending to rotate).\r
Also from my experience, it's a good idea to have a bump drilled in the axe to allow one of the M3 bolts to avoid rotation.\r
\r
Update :\r
V3 is stronger around the M3 nuts - the plastic here was prone to cracking when tightening too much in order to avoid the gear slipping on its axis.""" ;
