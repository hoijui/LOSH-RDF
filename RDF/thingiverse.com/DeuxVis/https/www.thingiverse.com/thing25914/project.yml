function: "An Ultimaker extruder big gear, for attachment on a non-threaded shaft.\r\n\r\nThis is an accessory for the Ultimaker extruder update by ghagen01 rather than a derivative.\r\n\r\nIt is needed if you have produced a 50materialwheel part without threading on its shaft - printed at shapeways in steel for instance, rather than machined.\r\n\r\nBy the way I uploaded the 2 metal parts on shapeways :\r\nhttp://www.shapeways.com/model/530334/\r\nhttp://www.shapeways.com/model/530335/\r\n\r\nUpdate :\r\nV2 is beefier (previous version was prone to flexing) and has better designed nut holes (nuts were tending to rotate).\r\nAlso from my experience, it's a good idea to have a bump drilled in the axe to allow one of the M3 bolts to avoid rotation.\r\n\r\nUpdate :\r\nV3 is stronger around the M3 nuts - the plastic here was prone to cracking when tightening too much in order to avoid the gear slipping on its axis."
