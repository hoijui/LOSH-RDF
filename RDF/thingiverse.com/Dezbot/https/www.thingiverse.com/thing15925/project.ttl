    okh:function """I remodeled my office with "nicer" painted floors and didnâ€™t want my favorite desk chairâ€™s caster wheels leaving imprint marks upon the floor.  \r
\r
In order to prevent marking the floor due to the direct contact of the chairâ€™s wheels  I designed some foot pads / boots for them.  \r
\r
On each foot pad I placed a felt furniture pad on the underside, thus preventing scuffing the floor.\r
\r
Yes, the boot prevents the wheel from rolling, but that was a fair tradeoff and actually part of the design for me.\r
\r
I designed the boot in the free version of Google Sketchup and a large design goal was to solve the problem with a minimal amount of material.\r
\r
The final model took my MakerBot about 30 minutes to print each boot,  which I still think is too long for the purpose.  I'd like to see a simpler solution that prints under 10 minutes on my configuration, but currently I've printed out what I need so don't really care about futzing around with further adjustments. Sorry, but it's the truth :)""" ;
