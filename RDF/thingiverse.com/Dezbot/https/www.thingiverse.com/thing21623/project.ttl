    okh:function """This is a press fit rod clamp that I built for my Thing-O-Matic so I could freely position the Z home limit switch on the 3/8â€ linear rod of the Z axis.  \r
\r
The motivation behind this clamp is that I typically design and print small objects in height, less than 30mm on average, so waiting on the Z-axis to travel ~120mm to find home is a waste of time.  To save time I wanted to be able to adjust the location of the Z limit switch on the TOM, this clamp allows me to do that.  The clamp could be used for other purposes also.\r
\r
After moving the Z limit switch recalibrating for new prints is a breeze because with Replicator 0025 it comes with the â€œThing O Matic Calibration Scriptâ€ which allows me to quickly recalibrate right from the UI with a couple of clicks.""" ;
