function: "This is a press fit rod clamp that I built for my Thing-O-Matic so I could freely position the Z home limit switch on the 3/8\xE2\u20AC\x9D linear rod of the Z axis.  \r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this clamp is that I typically design and print small objects in height, less than 30mm on average, so waiting on the Z-axis to travel ~120mm to find home is a waste of time.  To save time I wanted to be able to adjust the location of the Z limit switch on the TOM, this clamp allows me to do that.  The clamp could be used for other purposes also.\r\n\r\nAfter moving the Z limit switch recalibrating for new prints is a breeze because with Replicator 0025 it comes with the \xE2\u20AC\u0153Thing O Matic Calibration Script\xE2\u20AC\x9D which allows me to quickly recalibrate right from the UI with a couple of clicks."
