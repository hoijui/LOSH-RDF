function: "I wanted a way to quickly mix protein powder in a glass.  Doing it by hand was too labor intensive and I didn't get everything 100% mixed all the time and would leave blobs of goop on the bottom sides of the glass.  \r\n\r\nMore power was required! I made a slotted adapter that is fitted with two forks and then inserted into a drill.  Now I can whisk the powder into its proper slurry in just a couple of seconds and not have any left over blobs.\r\n\r\nObviously there are a bazillion different fork handle designs in the world so I can't say this is a universal adapter. The forks I have on hand have handles that are slightly concave so they wedge quite nicely into the slots in the adapter.\r\n\r\nVideo in action\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZScbuGgpFN0"
