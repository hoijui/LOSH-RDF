function: "This is an adapter plug that fits onto a Black & Decker 14.4V cordless drill battery pack.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to use a cordless drill battery pack for a project without disassembling the battery pack (so I could still charge it using the default charging adapter). I was having trouble getting wires to stay attached to the battery pack's prongs so I created a female adapter plug that can easily be inserted onto the prongs."
