function = "I needed some toothbrush holders for the bathroom that could be mounted to the wall.  Initially I printed the thing from PieterBos http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5497. Although it was functional after printing it I felt that it took too much material and had an inorganic feel to it with the hard crisp edgess of the design.  \r\n\r\nI wanted a softer feeling object so I designed these gender coded male and female toothbrush holders in Sketchup. I'm pretty happy with the outcome and its features:\r\n\r\nRounded, soft edges\r\nSmall, effecient design with minimal use of material\r\nSnappy tactile feedback when toothbrush gets locked into holder\r\nEmbossed with international male / female gender glyphs \r\nCounter sunk mounting screw hole\r\n\r\nHere's probably the only video in the world of a toothbrush holder demonstration. First!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY5x6RKtRAg"
