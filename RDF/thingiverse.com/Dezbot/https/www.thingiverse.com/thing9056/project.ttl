    okh:function """I needed some toothbrush holders for the bathroom that could be mounted to the wall.  Initially I printed the thing from PieterBos http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5497. Although it was functional after printing it I felt that it took too much material and had an inorganic feel to it with the hard crisp edgess of the design.  \r
\r
I wanted a softer feeling object so I designed these gender coded male and female toothbrush holders in Sketchup. I'm pretty happy with the outcome and its features:\r
\r
Rounded, soft edges\r
Small, effecient design with minimal use of material\r
Snappy tactile feedback when toothbrush gets locked into holder\r
Embossed with international male / female gender glyphs \r
Counter sunk mounting screw hole\r
\r
Here's probably the only video in the world of a toothbrush holder demonstration. First!\r
