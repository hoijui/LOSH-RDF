function = "The Many Use Thing is a tool that I designed in Sketchup.  It can be used for the following purposes:\r\n\r\n* Dremel collet tightening / loosening\r\n* 3/8\" Socket Driver\r\n* 1/4\" Socket Driver\r\n* 1/4\" Socket hold for bits\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo use as a Dremel collet tightener, slide the tool over the flat part of the collet and then squeeze the arms with your thumb and forefinger while twisting to tighten or loosen.\r\n\r\nThe 3/8\" and 1/4\" drive shafts are for sockets. After printing they will need to be \"broken in\". Trim up excess plastic and force a socket on and off a few times.  After that you can be assured that once a socket is put on it will not fall off.\r\n\r\nThe hole in the middle is 1/4\" so you can use it as a handle for bits.\r\n\r\nPhotoset:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/23450595@N02/sets/72157626847828041/\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/c26OSuSRPE4"
