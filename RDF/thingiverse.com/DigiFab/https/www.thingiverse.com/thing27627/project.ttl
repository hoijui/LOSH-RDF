Well, here's a start to something that might float your boat. The little brother of the Replicator, or the result of a one night stand between an Ultimaker and a Replicator. I've taken the Replicator files (at this point, just the frame really) and chopped off the lengths by ~5" and lowered the interior base by ~10mm for some more Z travel (could probably take off even more).\r
\r
Hoping that this gets others involved early on and we can fill out the other missing components quickly. My thinking is a 8" by 8" by 8" single extruder printer. (Let's be honest, dualstrusion will be awesome when we get PVA going, until then, one will do!). So pretty much a Replicator X/Y inside a Ultimaker-esque-ish-sized body...that's where the name RepliMaker came from in case you were wondering :P.""" ;
