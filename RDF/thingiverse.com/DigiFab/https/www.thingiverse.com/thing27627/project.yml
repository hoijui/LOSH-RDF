function: "Sometimes you just really don't care about printing things the size of a loaf of bread. Or you might not find printing in two colors any cooler/awesomer/better/(insert whatever here)than one color. Or just maybe you don't want to dedicate and entire table to your 3D printer?\r\n\r\nWell, here's a start to something that might float your boat. The little brother of the Replicator, or the result of a one night stand between an Ultimaker and a Replicator. I've taken the Replicator files (at this point, just the frame really) and chopped off the lengths by ~5\" and lowered the interior base by ~10mm for some more Z travel (could probably take off even more).\r\n\r\nHoping that this gets others involved early on and we can fill out the other missing components quickly. My thinking is a 8\" by 8\" by 8\" single extruder printer. (Let's be honest, dualstrusion will be awesome when we get PVA going, until then, one will do!). So pretty much a Replicator X/Y inside a Ultimaker-esque-ish-sized body...that's where the name RepliMaker came from in case you were wondering :P."
