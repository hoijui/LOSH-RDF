function = "Here is a simple solution for those of us that don't know where to put the MK5. I was originally placing my MK4 shifted upwards so I can have a clear view of the idler wheel. So I decided to incorporate the same placement with this item. This slips right ontop of the MK5. The gap is for your filament to go through. It is a snug fit so you def don't have to worry about it coming off. Just mount your board, slip this on  your MK5 and get printing!\r\n\r\nAlready working on a revision, the mounting board does not have to be completely solid ( It's about an hour print solid). Will post that shortly."
