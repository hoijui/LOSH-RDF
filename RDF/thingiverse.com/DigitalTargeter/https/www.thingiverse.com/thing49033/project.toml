Fully equiped with OberÃ¼rsel engine, spandau machineguns and ofcourse tri decks of wings and appropriate maltese cross'\r\n\r\nHopefully it will bring joy and and lots of airplane noise to your desktop :)\r\n\r\nA worthy enemy of the Fokker is in the making, either a Sobwith camel or a RAF SE. 5a\r\n\r\nThe model isnt made to an exact scale of the original, but it resembles the original as much as possible."
