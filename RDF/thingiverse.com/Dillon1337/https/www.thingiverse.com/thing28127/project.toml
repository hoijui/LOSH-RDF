function = "I'm sharing this file more for inspiration than to download and print out this file. It was custom-made for a project that I've been working on that switches a valve to water plants in the garden. It has a manual switch to control the valve or an Atmel Atmega328 AVR set up as an Arduino that is used as a timer attached to a relay to display information via a 16x2 character LCD and automatically turn the valve off after a adjustable amount of time.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about it on my blog at:\r\nhttp://tinkeringetc.blogspot.com/2012/08/automatic-garden-waterer-part-2.html\r\n\r\nSketchUp file is included."
