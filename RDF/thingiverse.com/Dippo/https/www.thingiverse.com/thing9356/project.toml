function = "This program is a simple and fast text displayer. Inside you find a handmade font, that gives the option to be resized to any size you want and to any depth/height you want.\r\nI tried to create a font that has a minimum of polygons but still is good readable.\r\nThe only problem is that Openscad can't handle strings, so text have to be placed letter by letter. \r\n\r\nI used this polygon generator program (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9290) to create the letters very quickly."
