function = "Inspired by aubenc's \"don't do it - hot end\" ( thingiverse.com/thing:9319 ). \r\n\r\nI took ( thingiverse.com/image:13901 ) as basis for the skull. Added bones because pirate flags mostly have bones, added lightning for a more depth effect, and a bottle. The only thing missing is fire. \r\n\r\nI used this polygon generator program ( thingiverse.com/thing:9290 ) to create this object."
