Print, place a pen inside and kling, klang, klung everything!\r\n\r\nI used this polygon generator program ( thingiverse.com/thing:9290 ) to create this object. \r\n\r\nVersion 2:\r\n- The hamer is now more round. The only problem with this, is that previewing takes at least 12 minutes;\r\n- The hamer head width is now a variable;\r\n- Rotated the design, so that you must print upside down."
