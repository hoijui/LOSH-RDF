function = "This was generated using Scherk-Collins Sculpture Generator here: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sequin/SCULPTS/scherk.html\r\n\r\nThe form here is a toroidal warp and is printable directly from the generator with a little clean up in Sketchup. The generator can do some other cool things too though so do play around. \r\n\r\nNotes on the generator:\r\n- Try not to use a high resolution or the STL will take ages to process and clean. \r\n- When saving out a file you have to manually add the .stl after your chosen name or it just saves as a generic file. \r\n- I have nothing to do with the generator or its development, I have used it before to create cool sculptures for 3D renderings and now that I have a 3D extruder i'm all over it again."
