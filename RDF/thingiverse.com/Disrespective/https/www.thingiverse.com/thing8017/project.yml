function: "Another Architecture test model to show people/students what the Thing-o-Matic is capable of.   \nIt's a long print at full size, just over 3 hours, but is a nice example of achievable overhangs, curved and flat faces. And a nice example of Jorn Utzon architecture too.  \nThe model is a little dirty and probably has a bunch of holes in it and extra triangles but prints pretty well.   \nIf anyone in the Wellington VUW League of Makers wants to see it in person then let me know. You know who you are..."
