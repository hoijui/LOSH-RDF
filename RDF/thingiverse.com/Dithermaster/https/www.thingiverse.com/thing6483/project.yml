function: My wife wanted to be able to hang things on the outside of our wardrobe (while preparing an outfit), so this is the first truly around-the-house practical thing I designed and made on my Makerbot. After I took the measurement of the thickness of the wood at the top of the wardrobe, I designed this in SketchUp. You can adjust the depth and height and hanger size to fit your needs.
