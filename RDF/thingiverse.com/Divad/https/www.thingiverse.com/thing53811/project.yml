function: "Basic Stargate Atlantis puddle jumper without the extend wings. The back hatch opens and closes on a pivot pin, and the front windshield is separate to be printed with clear see through plastic and will need to be glued in place. I have ideas to make this more detailed in the future but am happy with it for now.\r\n\r\nPlease leave comments.\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad.
