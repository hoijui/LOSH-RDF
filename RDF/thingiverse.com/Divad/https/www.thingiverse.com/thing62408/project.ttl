I present to you the Twist lock, print one piece as the base and the other piece as the key, insert key into base turn counter clockwise and presto! Its been twist locked. Oh, and maybe you want to take it apart too? Well turn the key part clockwise and pull it out Shazaam!! Its been twist unlocked. Have fun.\r
