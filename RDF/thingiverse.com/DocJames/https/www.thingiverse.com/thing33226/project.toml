function = "These are some parts for a filament spool system I have been fooling around with for my Mosaic printer.  \r\n\r\nThe mount is very solid, and can be bolted on to the Mosaic by using longer screws in existing captured nuts.  \r\n\r\nThe Axles are inserted through the hole, and include one that can hold a smaller spools (designed with parts from, and to be used with, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8317), as well as an experiential \"sealed\" system that I tried for high-humidity climates where a short coil of filament would be placed in a plastic Tupperware container (with desiccant), which was then mounted like a spool, but where the filament was pulled from the inside.  This worked, sort of, but was prone to tangles.  \r\n\r\nThis is very beta, but I thought I'd put it out there as I am unlikely to work more on it, as I have moved on to larger spools and the spool holder like http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21446\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were designed in OpenSCAD using Libraries http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6021 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8793"
