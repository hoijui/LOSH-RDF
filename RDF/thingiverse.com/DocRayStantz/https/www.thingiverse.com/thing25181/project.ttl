So, I made a basic divider to allow me to carry mints, ibuprofen, and B-12.  You can use it to carry whatever else you like (even something narrow along the long edge, in addition to the 3 bays).\r
\r
The only side effect is that any "dust" from any item carried may cross-contaminate the other items... but I'll take the risk for the convenience.  Minty ibuprofen should be standard, anyhow.  :)""" ;
