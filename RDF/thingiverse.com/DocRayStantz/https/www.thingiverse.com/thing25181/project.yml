function: "Who doesn't like carrying Altoids Smalls?  The only thing better would be if you could carry other small things in that tin with your mints... separately.  So, I made a basic divider to allow me to carry mints, ibuprofen, and B-12.  You can use it to carry whatever else you like (even something narrow along the long edge, in addition to the 3 bays).\r\n\r\nThe only side effect is that any \"dust\" from any item carried may cross-contaminate the other items... but I'll take the risk for the convenience.  Minty ibuprofen should be standard, anyhow.  :)"
