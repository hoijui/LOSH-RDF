function = "This is my uni-joint and handle derivative for Frits' steadicam.\r\n\r\nI wanted the uni-joint and the handle to be as short as possible. I printed the derivative uni-joint from aron (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14335) but just found it to be too long and bulky for my liking. (It is awesome for other uses though - it's in use in another project!)\r\n \r\nThis is made mainly with two printed parts, a 5/16 male/female ball joint, a cheap $5 Arlec LED torch and a skate bearing. \r\n\r\nFrom the two printed parts - The main part is designed to fit into the bottom laser cut piece of the 'handle adjustment group of lasercut pieces' of Frits' steadicam.\r\n- The smaller piece is a spacer to hold the skate bearing in place inside the torch head."
