function = "This is a modification of Wades extruder to fit a hot-end from BfB. \r\nI made holes to mount the hot-end, and removed all not-needed holes. \r\nI also moved the mounting holes so the filament holes is exactly in the middle of it.\r\n\r\nAll other parts are unmodified, and should be taken from the original.\r\n\r\nYou will also need a modified carriage if you want to use this on mendel.\r\nYou can find that under http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3017 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3016\r\n\r\nYou can find more info on this on:\r\nhttp://ifeelbeta.de/index.php/production/wades-extruder-with-bfb-hot-end"
