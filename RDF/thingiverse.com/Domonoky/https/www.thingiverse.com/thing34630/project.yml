function: "This are the complete digital files for our newly released BetaPrusa 3D printer kits. \r\n\r\nThe zip archive contains all plastic parts as openscad and exported stl models for our 3D printer kit. \r\nIt also contains a openscad file for the complete assembly down to every screw, washer and cable needed.  \r\nThere are openscad files for all other parts like the RAMPS1.4 Elektronics, Optoendstops and all.\r\nThis was used to generate a very nice assembly guide. Which is attached here.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this on our blog www.ifeelbeta.de  \r\n\r\nAnd if you want to buy it, you can find 3 different variants, starting at 499\xE2\u201A\xAC in our onlineshop at www.2printbeta.de"
