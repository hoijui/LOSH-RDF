function: "First student attempt (by Trevor) at tracing a .jpg file and turning it into a 3D object. \r\n\r\nIt looked good in Sketchup, though we felt like it didn't \"Push/Pull\" the way we wanted it to. This should have been our clue that something was amiss. \r\n\r\nWhen we printed it out it had holes in it that we hadn't planned!"
