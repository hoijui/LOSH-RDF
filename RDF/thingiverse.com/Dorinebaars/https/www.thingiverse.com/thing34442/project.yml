function: "WHO ARE YOU. WHAT DO YOU LIKE. WHERE ARE YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING.  \nWHO ARE YOU DOING IT WITH. WHO'S YOUR FAVOURITE NINJA TURTLE.  \nTHIS IS THE OVEREXPOSED REALITY THAT WE LIVE IN NOW THAT SOCIAL  \nMEDIA AND FACIAL RECOGNITION DEVICES HAVE BECOME A SIGNIFICANT  \nAND ALMOST UNAVOIDABLE ASPECT OF OUR LIVES.  \n IS AN OPEN DESIGN PROJECT, WHICH CHALLENGES  \nTHIS DECREASE OF ANONYMITY. MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALL  \nMY PERSONAL TRIVIAL MATTERS AND I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO HEAR  \nABOUT YOURS. SO WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT AND BECOME A LITTLE LESS  \nRECOGNIZABLE? THEN THIS MIGHT BE RIGHT UP YOUR STREET."
