AND best of all ;-) Clock-Out-Pin and Data-Out-Pin .. so you can chain this chip with 2 wires :-)\r\n\r\ne.g. for the 15 x 6 RGB-LED-Matrix i'am building .. a build 6 Cube-Columns ... every column is powered by one WS2803 Chip which is connected to the next column .. its quite easy to build a giant LED-Matrix with this driver .. please notice .. a LED is max. requiring 20ma so in my scenario i'am using    15*6 Leds => 90 LEDs each LED will require current ;-) so you need a pretty strong power-source (5v @ 6a)\r\n\r\nFor controlling the WS2803 i'am using a simple Arduino UNO (you can use any other microcontroller you like .. Picunio .. stm32...)\r\n\r\nAt the Bottom of every column i am mounting a \"electronics cube\" for the ws2803 circuit .. the cubes are having wiring holes ... one led-mount (you need cooling to get the correct diameter) and a option to use cable ties .... i used a glue gun.\r\n\r\n*** For the WS2803 you ned RGB-LEDs with same ANODE (+) ***\r\n\r\n*** The WS2803 is a PWM-Driver so you can dim every led with 8 bit (0..255) ***\r\n\r\n*** The photos are showing the back-side of the cubes ;-)\r\n\r\n*** Power-Source Notes: \r\n\r\nLED[r?] 2,2v * 20ma => 0,044 Watt per Channel\r\nLED[g?] 3,3v * 20ma => 0,066 Watt per Channel\r\nLED[b?] 3,4v * 20ma => 0,068 Watt per Channel\r\nLED                => 0,79  Watt per LED\r\n\r\ne.g. 6x6 Matrix => 36 RGB-LEDs (108 Channels)\r\n\r\n36 RGB-LEDs * 0,79W => 28,44 Watt + ICs + Microcontroller + Doubled-Security ..\r\nLets say a 60 Watt Power-Source should be fine in this case .. however .. do our own calculations ;-) .."
