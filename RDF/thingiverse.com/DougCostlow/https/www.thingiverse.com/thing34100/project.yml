function: This is my auger based pet feeder inspired by the work of Tunell and kitlaan here on Thingiverse.  The design centers on using a PVC plumbing tee and printed parts to build an auger screw conveyor that dispenses pet food.  The screw is driven by standard hobby servo which can be controlled by your favorite microcontroller. This means anything can control the pet feeder activation, a simple timer, a smart phone, twitter, your own brain waves or even better your pet's brain waves!
