function = "#backtoschool  \n\n*UPDATE* - I've revised the original shape of the slot to fit smaller pieces of paper, which may slouch when alone.  \n\nA stand alone, paper stand-up for use by holding page(s) upright.  This makes typing and productivity a bit more easy.  \n\nThis was part of a \"Day Project\" at FreesideAtlanta.org  \n\nIn all fairness, Sparr and I became challenged in a Speed-Modeling contest.  Me on Lightwave 3D and he on OpenSCAD.  Sparr was victorious, but agreed to let me upload my model anyways.  Thanks bud.  \n\nI'm including this original as well as the Freeside Atlanta emboss.
