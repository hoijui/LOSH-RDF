function = "This is a model, designed for use by a \"Throwie\" for illumination.  Just a fun party favor, nothing more.\r\n\r\nI've included 3 files in this entry:\r\n1. PumpkinStringLight is the generic pumpkin model with a solid fill\r\n2. PumpkinBoolean is the pumpkin with the center hallow and a hole in the bottom for Throwie insertion or string light.\r\n3. PumpkinFoot55 is an example foot model cutout I did, which illuminates nicely.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AewEMUqiBk8"
