    okh:function """*UPDATE 9 August 2013*  
-refined geometry in the foot and ankle.  Some people were troubled with the faceted geometry before, so now it should print smoother  

*UPDATE 31 January 2013*  
-Added Ankle and Knee Joints with 4 additional bones (Fibula, Tibia, Patella, and distal Femur)  
-Vastly improved Metatarsals  
-Corrected Foot alignment  
-Talus has been completely revamped from a low polygon retopology from 123D Catch reconstruction of Cadaver Specimen.  

There are 26 proper bones in the human foot; 28 if you consider the sesamoids of the 1st metatarsal phalangeal joint complex.  That's over 25% of your body's total musculo-skeletal anatomy, hitting the ground every time you go for a walk or run!  Quite impressive, really.

This anatomic foot model was designed in Newtek's Lightwave 3D, as part of the podcast @ www.YouTube.com/DrGlassDPM  

Anatomic study models can be quite expensive, http://search.anatomywarehouse.com/search?keywords=foot&x=0&y=0 so I wanted to share my printable version with the Thingiverse crowd and give a big shout out to Freeside Atlanta's Hackerspace!""" ;
