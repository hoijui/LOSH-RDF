function: "*UPDATE 9 August 2013*  \n-refined geometry in the foot and ankle.  Some people were troubled with the faceted geometry before, so now it should print smoother  \n\n*UPDATE 31 January 2013*  \n-Added Ankle and Knee Joints with 4 additional bones (Fibula, Tibia, Patella, and distal Femur)  \n-Vastly improved Metatarsals  \n-Corrected Foot alignment  \n-Talus has been completely revamped from a low polygon retopology from 123D Catch reconstruction of Cadaver Specimen.  \n\nThere are 26 proper bones in the human foot; 28 if you consider the sesamoids of the 1st metatarsal phalangeal joint complex.  That's over 25% of your body's total musculo-skeletal anatomy, hitting the ground every time you go for a walk or run!  Quite impressive, really.  \n\nRead More:  \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot  \nhttp://www.learnbones.com/foot-bones-anatomy  \n\nThis anatomic foot model was designed in Newtek's Lightwave 3D, as part of the podcast @ www.YouTube.com/DrGlassDPM  \n\nAnatomic study models can be quite expensive, http://search.anatomywarehouse.com/search?keywords=foot&x=0&y=0 so I wanted to share my printable version with the Thingiverse crowd and give a big shout out to Freeside Atlanta's Hackerspace!"
