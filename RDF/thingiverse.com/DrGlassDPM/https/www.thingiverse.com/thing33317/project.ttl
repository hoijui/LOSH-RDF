    okh:function """In anatomy terms: the bottom of the foot is referred to as "plantar".  The inspiration practically dictates itself.\r
\r
Behold, the first plantar planter!  This podiatric flower pot design is simply a foot in a sandal, which sits in a dish.  Everyone needs a plant in their life; one that resides in a container with drainage holes and a catch dish for cleanliness.  This thing is a modified derivative of the Skin Layer from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22628\r
\r
This design is a flower pot or a botanical planter shaped like a foot.  I included the foot, sandal, and dish as a separate files (for dualstrusion).  The ridges of the sandal slot into the grooves of the dish to offer some stability.\r
\r
I've also included the Low Polygon version, LowPoly-PlantarFoot.lwo, for Lightwave 3D users out there who want to tinker.\r
\r
For Single Extrusion Print: Dish.stl & Combined.stl\r
\r
For Duel Extrusion (Dualstrusion) Print: Dish.stl, Foot.stl & Sandal.stl (separate nozzles)\r
\r
For Tinkering: PF-LowPoly.lwo for Lightwavers who want to take it into their own direction.  Have Fun!\r
