function: "In anatomy terms: the bottom of the foot is referred to as \"plantar\".  The inspiration practically dictates itself.\r\n\r\nBehold, the first plantar planter!  This podiatric flower pot design is simply a foot in a sandal, which sits in a dish.  Everyone needs a plant in their life; one that resides in a container with drainage holes and a catch dish for cleanliness.  This thing is a modified derivative of the Skin Layer from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22628\r\n\r\nThis design is a flower pot or a botanical planter shaped like a foot.  I included the foot, sandal, and dish as a separate files (for dualstrusion).  The ridges of the sandal slot into the grooves of the dish to offer some stability.\r\n\r\nI've also included the Low Polygon version, LowPoly-PlantarFoot.lwo, for Lightwave 3D users out there who want to tinker.\r\n\r\nFor Single Extrusion Print: Dish.stl & Combined.stl\r\n\r\nFor Duel Extrusion (Dualstrusion) Print: Dish.stl, Foot.stl & Sandal.stl (separate nozzles)\r\n\r\nFor Tinkering: PF-LowPoly.lwo for Lightwavers who want to take it into their own direction.  Have Fun!\r\n\r\n*Bonus Points* Print in PLA for Biodegradable Greenish-ness"
