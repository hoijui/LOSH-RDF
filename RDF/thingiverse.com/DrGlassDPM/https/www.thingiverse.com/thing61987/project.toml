function = "We are now in the midst of a 501(c)3 status approval and we couldn't be happier.  \n\nFreeside Atlanta (est. 2009) is a nonprofit work space built entirely by volunteers. We are a community of makers, tinkerers, engineers, programmers, artists, teachers, and lunatics. As a community, we have built out our space with tools and equipment for electronics, 3D printing, woodworking, metalworking, art, design, classes, and events. Everything you see in our space was donated or built by members.  \nOur members are engaged in amazing projects and love to share knowledge. We also develop and work with open source and free technology wherever possible, and try to release our creations under variants of the Creative Commons license.  \nYou don't have to be a Freeside member to come to our events or take our classes. We encourage you to come out to the Tuesday night Open House that we have every week at 7:30pm or to any of the other public classes or events that we have on Meetup. Come check the place out and see if this is a community that you'd be interested in joining!"
