function: "Finally, a whistle with flair! Impress your friends with how distinguished you look when you make high-pitched noises. The photo of me modeling the whistle also includes a moustache cookie cutter by http://www.thingiverse.com/destos.\r\n\r\nIt says \"Fab Lab Tulsa\" on it because that is where I was when I made it."
