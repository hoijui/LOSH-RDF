function: "The Jog it! Pendant is a hand held controller you can use to control a CNC machine through Mach 3 or Linux CNC.  \r\n\r\nThe first version of the pendant used a CNC machined case and was a featured project on Kickstarter.  You can find more information about how it works here: http://dtrobotics.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html\r\n\r\nThis version of the pendant uses a 3D printed case and can be completely built from scratch by you thanks to the source files being open source.  You can also purchase an electronics and hardware kit to complete it if you want to go that route."
