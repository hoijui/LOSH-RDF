\r
I modified the design to have properly pointed hearts, as well as a little circle on the top of one of them so it's clear which was is the front of the crown.\r
\r
I've included both the STL and the OpenSCAD files.  Please enjoy and feel free to add your own little doodads and decorations to the top of the crown.  Makes a great gifts.""" ;
