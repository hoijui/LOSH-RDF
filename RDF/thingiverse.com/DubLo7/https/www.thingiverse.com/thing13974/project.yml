function: "This is my modification of The Princess Heart Crown requested by my daughter.  I made the original Princess Heart Crown, but she didn't like how the top was flat / cut off looking.\r\n\r\nI modified the design to have properly pointed hearts, as well as a little circle on the top of one of them so it's clear which was is the front of the crown.\r\n\r\nI've included both the STL and the OpenSCAD files.  Please enjoy and feel free to add your own little doodads and decorations to the top of the crown.  Makes a great gifts."
