\r
Larger diameter pucks tend to float better because they have more air under them.  Play around with the thickness and size of the air gap until you have whatever works best for you.\r
\r
This is also a really good test of your bridging, although nothing dramatic like the whistle it's still cool to watch it build.\r
\r

Enjoy.""" ;
