function = "This is a snap on pencil holder for drafting tables.  It is made to fit the dimensions of my desk, but it's parametric so it can easily be adjusted to fit your desk too.  The holes are a bit larger than the standard 8mm needed to hold a regular number 2 pencil so I can use my drafting pencils or pens with it."
