function = "this is a prototype connector design for assembling geodesic domes and spheres. rather than using preset strut angles, it uses a flexible ball joint strut connection that allows the structure to adapt to a variety of configurations. therefore, all that's required to build a dome of any scale or frequency is the proper strut length calculations, available from: http://simplydifferently.org or http://desertdomes.com\r\n\r\nthe design is based off of william adams' yazzo disc joint openscad script, modified to include a shape language of hexagons and pentagons for the six- and five-way connector types. the strut caps used in this prototype should fit 3/8\" diameter dowels (but they might not)\r\n\r\nupdate 3/16 â€” added strutcap.scad. other code forthcoming."
