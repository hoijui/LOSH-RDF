function = "Here's a more polished, production-ready update to the domekit 3d-printable geodesic connector system. We refactored the central hub to feature a rounded edge and use less material. The strutcaps are shorter while being more durable, and include an integrated thumbscrew (with captive nut) that locks the strut to the node. This makes the structure easier to assemble, because you're not trying to snap the balls into the sockets â€” just slide the strut into the shaft and turn the screw.\r\n\r\n+ + + \r\n\r\nplease visit http://domekit.cc for more details"
