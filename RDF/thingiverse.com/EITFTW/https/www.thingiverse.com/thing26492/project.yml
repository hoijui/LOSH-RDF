function: "Its difficult to perambulate in a haughty manner when you have eight appendages...\r\n\r\nA derivative of the excellent fancy octopus by IWorkInPixels, with a cane for extra class. We add this to everything we build. Everything in our office is now fancy. \r\n\r\nEDIT: We have now added a one-shot model with all accessories and octopus. As well as an array of accessories, should you wish to add them to other models."
