function: "This is a variation of clintkc's \"Beverage can holder/handle v2\".\r\n\r\nI couldn't get his .stl through gcode generation and his model has too many holes (once imported to sketchup) for me to reasonably find and fix.\r\n\r\nThis version has no handle. We've started using things like this at CCCKC to identify different peoples sodas... I may add another version with a handle later."
