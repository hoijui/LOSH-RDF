function = "These are spacers to put on a rolling pin so that you can get a specific and even dough thickness.  The STL is for a 3/8\" dough thickness and about 1 and 7/8\" rolling pin.   The SCAD file can be edited to make many different dough thicknesses and rolling pin diameters (I didn't try them all though).  \n\nJan 2015: Updated to a slanted gap."
