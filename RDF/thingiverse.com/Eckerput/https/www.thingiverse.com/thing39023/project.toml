function = "These are brackets to replace the broken plastic ones on a dresser drawer. The trapezoid piece goes on the front of the dresser channel.  The dresser channel is screwed in directly at the back.  The block type piece holds the channel on the back end of the drawer.  The drawer channel is screwed directly into the front of the drawer.  The combination of these two pieces keeps the drawer from tipping when it is pulled out."
