function = "This is a bracket to mount a Kodak Play Sport video camera to a ski pole.  It is designed for easy on and easy off. The Play Sport is an older HD waterproof video camera.  It is possible this design could be modified for other flip type cameras.\r\n\r\nNote, I'm still testing this so the design may evolve as I discover issues."
