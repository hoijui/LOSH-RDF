function: Here is a modification of brendandawes Field Note Clip.  The pencil holder section was made smaller to fit what I believe is a standard pencil.  The clip thickness is also reduced to the bare minimum.  I made it to fit my daughter's sling so she can carry a pencil to class.  I suspect it will also fit cardboard notebook covers as well.  There is the letter "I' on one side and a smile emoticon on the other.
