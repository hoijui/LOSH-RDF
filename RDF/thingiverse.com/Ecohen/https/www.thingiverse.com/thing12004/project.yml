function: "The great derivative robot, ThingiZord, has arrived!\r\nHe represents the power of the online community. This is my entry for the GrabCAD MakerBot Challenge.\r\nThe model should fit together as an articulated ball and socket action figure, but requires a LOT of support material to print.\r\n\r\nUsed in this model: Brebble Head by tbuser, Yoda - Lite by faberdasher, Sign of the Horns by dietz1, Wings by MaskedRetriever, Turtle Shell Racer \xE2\u20AC\u201C High Power Edition by Skimbal, Stanford Bunny by phooky, High Quality Pliers by russrobot, MakerBot Coin by bre, Ninja Star by SeanN, Whistle by Zaggo, Coin-op Bottle Opener by Starno and Y U No?
