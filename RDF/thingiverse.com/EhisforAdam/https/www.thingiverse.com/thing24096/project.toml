function = "When I first got my Raspberry Pi I was measuring it and modeling up a holder for it. I'd been thinking about it for some time and wanted to get my hands on one before I started making it. This is the 3rd iteration of the design. I added the cut outs and shaped the stands to provide better clearance and hold the board more securly. Enjoy!"
