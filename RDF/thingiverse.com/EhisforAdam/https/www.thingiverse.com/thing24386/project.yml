function: I'm working on a project to mount my Chumby One in a new case. I've been planning this for quite some time and the Chumby hasn't been on in a very long time. Getting my maker bot and doing a couple projects has inspired me to get working on my Chumby mod. Even though they aren't making the hardware anymore, this is sure to be awesome. I'm going to post parts as I make them and keep updating the progress.
