function: "I've been wanting to do a case modded Chumby for quite some time.  I bought the Chumby One for $50 quite a long time ago from Woot and started it up once then tore it apart. It sat like that for a while, then I bought the radio off ebay. Luckily the clock opening was close to the correct size for the Chumby screen. I sat on it for a while until I got my Makerbot. The radio and clock internals are on a removable chassis held into the body by 2 screws, I decided to use this same basic idea for my Chumby mod because I didn't want to permanently modify the radio. The base plate is a piece of aluminum sheet and the various components are riveted in place. All the Chumby components are held in place with the screws that originally held them together. \r\n\r\nProblems/Future Plans:\r\n*One of the knobs from the radio wasn't reused (under the screen), this might get made into a power button.\r\n*The screen holder back plate had to be bend a bit to work. (I also didn't want to print another screen holder).\r\n*Make a back cover.\r\n*Make a cover to hide the gap around the screen.\r\n*There was no other way to attach the screen, so the holder is hot glued onto the case, but this is easily removed.\r\n*Some Chumby apps are no longer supported, a big example being Twitter.\r\n*I broke the microphone connector and may fix it and add this back later."
