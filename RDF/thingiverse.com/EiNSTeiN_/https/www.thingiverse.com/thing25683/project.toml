function = "This is a bowden attachement which was designed as a add-on to fit on any existing extruder and x-carriage of a Prusa Mendel.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the picture, there is a mounting bracket for the extruder which mounts on the threaded rods at the top of the printer. The hotend mounting piece is meant to fit on any existing Prusa x-carriage. The bowden tube is held in place with a M4 nut threaded onto each end of the tube.\r\n\r\nI used 2mm ID/4mm OD PTFE tube from seemecnc.com which seems to work.\r\n\r\nThis whole setup was tested and extrusion was achieved but it has yet to be tested extensively."
