function = "This is a beefier version of the bowden clamp for rostock. I decided to use 3mm filament so the original version was a little bit too small. Then I didn't have a proper nut to hold the tube in place like the original, so I decided to add grooves to the jaw so I could use zipties.\r\n\r\nI hold my hotend in place with long screws on each side of it, so I also changed the body to have a square center part instead of a rounded one.\r\n\r\nI also added a parameter to this clamp in the scad file, so it can be generated without the hotend hole at the bottom, in order to use the same clamp on the extruder side of the bowden tube."
