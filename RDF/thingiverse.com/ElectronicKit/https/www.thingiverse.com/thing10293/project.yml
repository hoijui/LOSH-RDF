function: I ran out of room trying to mount all of the electronics for my scratch built 3D printer chassis.  Using a couple of these stepper driver brackets was a big help in mounting all of the electronics.  The bracket takes up about 1/2 the space of a single stepper driver PCB mounted flush to the chassis.  That means you can vertically mount 4 stepper PCBs in about the same space as 1 horizontally mounted card.
