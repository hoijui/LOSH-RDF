function = "Please note, I have NOT built one of these yet and you will need a HEATED BUILD PLATFORM to print this object.\r\n\r\nHere is a pump that can be used for liquid or air.  A piece of 3/8\" diameter surgical tubing is looped through the 2 holes on the left side of the pump base around a 4 point rotor that compresses the tubing pushing the liquid or air ahead. This technique isolates the material being pumped from the mechanism itself.  The rotor design could be improved greatly by placing wheels at the end of each point pushing against the tubing.\r\n\r\nUPDATE on 05/31/10: The STL files below look like they need something 'added' in order for SkeinForge to generate the GCODE.  I have spent days trying to figure out why and how to fix it.  I thought an STL file was mostly a list of ASCII lines and did not realize centering and size info are not being saved to the files."
