function: "When you replace a light switch or wall socket, occassionally the spacing between the fixture and the wall enclosure does not match.  This is especially true if some remodeling has occured or the fixture was not installed correctly in the 1st place.\r\n\r\nThe attached stl files generate a 4-up set and a single spacer commonly used for that application.\r\n\r\nTypically, a spacer is placed on the top and bottom fixture mounting #8-32 screws.  If more spacing is needed, this item can be stacked to get the placement right. The spacer hole gives a tight press fit and the opening allows adding or removal as needed.\r\n\r\nYeah, I know these are cheap to purchase and available at most hardware stores that have a decent electrical section, but it is Sunday night and you need a couple of them now!"
