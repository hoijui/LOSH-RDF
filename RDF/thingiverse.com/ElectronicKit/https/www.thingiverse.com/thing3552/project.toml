function = "Visit any brick-and-mortar business that has a service counter and you will likely see a small plastic or wood easel holding a stack of business cards.  I have also seen this type of easel used in restaurants, museums and offices holding up some kind of fixed message card.\r\n\r\nThe upper photo shows a business card (87mm X 50mm) on the easel to get an idea of size.  The easel itself is 47mm X 40mm (W X H) and leans back at something like 17 degrees.\r\n\r\n  This easel will hold a dozen flat business cards and there is a 0.7mm lip on the leading edge of the easel's ledge to help hold the cards in place."
