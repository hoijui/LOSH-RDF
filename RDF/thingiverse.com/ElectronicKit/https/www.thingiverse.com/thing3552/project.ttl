\r
The upper photo shows a business card (87mm X 50mm) on the easel to get an idea of size.  The easel itself is 47mm X 40mm (W X H) and leans back at something like 17 degrees.\r
\r
  This easel will hold a dozen flat business cards and there is a 0.7mm lip on the leading edge of the easel's ledge to help hold the cards in place.""" ;
