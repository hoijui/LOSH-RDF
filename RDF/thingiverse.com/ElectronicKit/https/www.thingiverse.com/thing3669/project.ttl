    okh:function """The idea is to use a 3D printer to make office stationery stamps.  Actually, the ABS stamp you produce is more like a wood cut, but works almost as good as a soft rubber stamp. Impressions are much improved by having a stack of paper under the sheet you are printing on.  Each stamp impression is slightly different is the good and bad news.\r
\r
 I remember (a LOT of years ago) having to put my initials in black Indian ink onto every piece of clothing for Summer camp and later in high-school gym class.  Having a monogram stamp and some suitable permanent ink would have sure saved time.  Woodworkers might find this handy to initial the bottom of their finished projects.\r
\r
The files here are for the stamp base, a cover, a demo PAID stamp face plus an additional file with a blank face for you to add backwards reading 3D text to make whatever stamp you need.  The finished stamp size is 48mm X 18mm (WxH)  Using text is optional - an icon or hand drawing would work as well.\r
\r
The cover fits over your inked up stamp to prevent making a giant mess when you are done using it.\r
\r
The top photo shows a slightly retouched PAID in red ink.  I have filled in some voids, and black spots within the letters for the sake of the photo's appearance.  Switching from black to red ink for the photo was a mistake on my part, but red ink seemed like a better final color.\r
\r
EDITED 08-12-12 The STL rendering problem described below seems to have been fixed.\r
\r
Thingiverse's rendered image of the PAID stamp face seems to have been reversed somehow - the 3D letters should read backward for the stamp to print correctly as the 1st and 2nd photos show.\r
\r
This idea works good - you get a perfectly useable stamp that gets  across a short messages.""" ;
