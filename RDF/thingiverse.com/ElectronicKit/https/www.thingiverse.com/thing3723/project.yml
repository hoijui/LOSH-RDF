function: "This is a derivative of \"Knob for a 1/4in. Hex Screw by noobcake\":  \nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3596  \n\nI had a problem tightening a couple of metric M8 threaded clamps on my old drill press using the stock \"7 bump knob\" (2nd photo shows original and improved version).  They never worked right and after looking at Noobcake's design, thought his would work way better.  It did.  \n\nThere are 2 changes to the original design.  The knob's hex opening now fits an M8 threaded hex nut and there is a hole through the knob to accommodate the 3\" bolt shaft on the clamp."
