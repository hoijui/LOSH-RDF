    okh:function """Here is a simple handle I did to replace a broken one on a portable work table vise.  The handle tightens one end of the table vise and was originally broken off during an accident with a circular saw (3rd photo).  The wood piece I was cutting covered the handle which happened to be tightened just below the piece...  I had tried to fix it a couple of times with super glue, but the break is located at a high stress point. The new one is bright red and about 25mm longer so I hope not to repeat the same mistake.\r
\r
The shape of the handle is modelled after a column in a building I saw somewhere that stuck in my mind.  Looked like 2 square columns merging 45 degrees from floor to ceiling.  The ceiling column tapers down into the smaller based floor column.\r
\r
The 3D printed handle is 87mm long, 14mm square at the hole end and widens to 21mm square.""" ;
