function = "Here is a simple design for a bearing mount that can be used to hold an 8mm lead screw or 8mm guide rod.  I have been kicking around the design for a DIY CNC mill table using the Gen 3 MakerBot/RepRap motherboard and stepper driver cards.\r\n\r\nThe object accepts the 608 skateboard ball bearing and there are 2 mounting holes for 3mm or 4mm bolts to fasten the thing down."
