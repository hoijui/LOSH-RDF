function = "Here is a charging dock and dual angle (8 and 30 degrees) stand for the iPhone 5.  There is a pocket in the base to coil in the Lightening cable for a neater appearance. The docking position slot is wide enough to handle a hard shell case on the phone (like the one from INCIPIO) and there is a second ledge to set the phone on in either the vertical or horizontal position at a 30 degree angle."
