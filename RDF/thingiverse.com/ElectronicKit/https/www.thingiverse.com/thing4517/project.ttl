    okh:function """Just in time for Halloween - a 102mm x 150mm MakerBot printable spider.  Printed in black (or glow-in-the-dark ABS) this thing would look pretty real.  3rd photo down is a cheat, I photoshopped a white ABS spider  photo to get an idea of what black would look like. Modelled after a googled diagram of the real thing, the proportions should be pretty close except for the 10X size.\r
\r
The spider head is not real detailed having only a couple of (closed) fangs hanging down.\r
\r
What I learned from working on this is that modelling animals is way harder then doing geometric objects.  There are no straight lines only short segments of changing length and diameter.  Makes me appreciate that much more the modelling done to generate the animals, busts and figures posted on Thingiverse.""" ;
