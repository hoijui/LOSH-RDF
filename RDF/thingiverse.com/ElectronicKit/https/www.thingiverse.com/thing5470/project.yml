function: "This is a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4281 .  That mount, which I submitted several months ago, would not work with 80/20 aluminum framing. There are 2 differences between that version and this one:\r\n1. Wider body to straddle the T-bolt channel on the 80/20 frame piece.\r\n2. Bearing mounting holes increased to handle M6 sized bolts.\r\n\r\nThis bearing mount was designed to support an 8mm leadscrew (the same one used in the MakerBot CC).  A mating 80/20 NEMA17 stepper motor mount ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5391 ) matches the shaft mounting height, 21.5mm, to support the 8mm rod level."
