function: This, you'll never print, but this a tribute to how I found Makerbot. Stanley Meyer basically invented a resonant transformer, that in conjunction with a capacitor (contents of just water), would achieve incredible voltage at the circuit's resonant frequency. This effortlessly breaks down water (H2O) into combustible H2 and O (gas), thusly solving all energy problems. He was supposedly poisoned.
