function = "This is my own design quadcopter; 4x4 central station with 4 sections, expandable to fit more sensors, cameras, etc. Has no landing gear for the time being. Can be printed or CNC'd. Makerbots/other desktop printers with either x or y dimensions smaller than 6\" in will not be able to make this.\r\n\r\nAnd also, Solidworks Assemblies translate into a bunch of parts in STL, so I guess you'll just have to wing it if you want to put it together. Shouldn't be hard, though. Tell me if I'm missing anything."
