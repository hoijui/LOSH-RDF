function = "An update on the previous sedign, this routes the X stage wire to the side instead of straight out, and has notches for zip-tie securing.\r\n\r\nThis helps route the wires coming off the X stage on the ThingOMatic.  The heated build platform wire can be secured to this piece with two zip-ties, to help route it such that it doesn't get caught or pinched as the X and Y stages move to the ends of their travel envelope.  It also secures the cable coming off the X stage travel limit switch.\r\n\r\nStill a work in progress as I tweak the design."
