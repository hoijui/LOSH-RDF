    okh:function """This thing is the end result of an ongoing project to manage the wires coming off the ThingOMatic Heated Build Platform.  I needed to print objects which were near the maximum size of the TOM build envelope, and found that when printing at the corners of the platform the cable would frequently become pinched between the build platform or Y stage and the TOM enclosure, stalling the servos and ruining the print.  I also didn't like how the cables would rub against the Y stage smooth rods and pully sometimes, and wanted to do something about a strain relief for the HBP connector.\r
\r
This Thing is the result, a system of parts which completely encloses the cable and forces it to move in a predictable path that stays out of the way of the build platform and Y stage, and also acts as some degree of a strain relief for the build platform and Y axis endstop connectors.  With this Thing my TOM can print objects filling the entire print volume reliably.\r
\r
The chain link is anchored in three spots.  The X stage end anchors to the wooden rib on the right side of the build platform.  This will require a small hole to be drilled for a bolt to hold this piece in place.  A zip-tie is used here to secure the HBP cable.\r
\r
The centerpoint piece attaches to the right side of the Y stage.  This requires removing one of the rod endcap plates and attaching the printed part in its place.  This is the most annoying part of the installation as you have to partially dissassemble the end of the Y stage to get this piece in place.\r
\r
The baseplate anchor is the easiest to install, it just snap-fits into the square hole in the corner of the clear plastic plate.\r
\r
The cable links snap together, and can be installed after you have the anchor pieces in place.  I use 9 links between the build platform and the midpoint anchor, and 10 between the midpoint and the baseplate anchor, but you may find different numbers work better for you depending on how long your cables are.  Each chain link has slots where you can zip-tie the wires in place if you desire, although I haven't found that to be necessary.  These chain links may also be useful by themselves in other applications where you need to control the movement of a moving cable bundle.\r
\r
This Thing can be attached to an existing TOM without having to disconnect any cables in the process.""" ;
