function = "This is the latest mod I've made to my Rostock-derived 3D printer.  This is my attempt to make a hot end carriage that is as structurally minimalistic as possible, while still holding all the components associated with the hot end on my printer.  That includes three mini 20mm fans, LEDs, holes to guide the wires, and the mini J-head hot end itself.\r\n\r\nNote - the delta platform geometry on my printer is not the same as that on a normal Rostock printer.  I moved the rod end holes on the hot end carriage a quarter inch closer to the hot end to reduce the size and weight of the carriage.  You can't print this part and use it on a standard Rostock without changing the geometry of the rest of the printer appropriately."
