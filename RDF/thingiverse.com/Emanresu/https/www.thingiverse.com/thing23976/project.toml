function = "A simple mount for a NEMA stepper motor designed to be clamped to a surface (specifically an optics breadboard, but any flat surface should work).   \r\n\r\nThe application this mount was designed for is one where the stepper is coupled via a flexible drive shaft, (http://www.mcmaster.com/#flexible-drive-shafts/=mkxgvu) such that placement of the motor isn't critical.  It has 3 clamping surfaces so the motor can be oriented at 0ยบ, 45ยบ, or 90ยบ with respect to the table it is clamped to."
