function: This is a derivitive of Simonious' Supa Flat x-carriage that I have modified it for printability. His original x-carriage has nut traps that transitioned to holes, but he did not allow your slicer to generate any kind of bridging to print the hole on top of the larger nut trap, resulting in additional clean-up.
