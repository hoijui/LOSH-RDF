\r
It was designed for the MakerGear GrooveMount system, so it will work with MakerGear, J-Head, or any other hot end that is compatible with the GrooveMount system.\r
\r
This was only designed with the Birdstruder and Simonious' Supa-Flat X-Carriage in mind. If you are not using these two parts, I can't guarantee it will work right for you.""" ;
