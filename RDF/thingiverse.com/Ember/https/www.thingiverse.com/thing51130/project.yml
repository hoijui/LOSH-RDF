function: "I needed a bracket to rotate my Birdstruder on my MendelMax 90\xC2\xB0 so I could enjoy the full print bed area. I designed this bracket, and these files are the result.\r\n\r\nIt was designed for the MakerGear GrooveMount system, so it will work with MakerGear, J-Head, or any other hot end that is compatible with the GrooveMount system.\r\n\r\nThis was only designed with the Birdstruder and Simonious' Supa-Flat X-Carriage in mind. If you are not using these two parts, I can't guarantee it will work right for you."
