function: "I'm a Design & Technology teacher with a new MakerBot and I'm trying to think of projects for my year 10 students. This is an idea that I had, students will carefully pull apart an old (or new) working  USB stick and they would design a new shell for it. This project will test their measuring and CAD skills.\r\n\r\nHere is my first attempt - not very creative but I just wanted to make sure that it was possible. \r\n\r\nFeel free to put forward any other ideas for year 10 projects... they need to be reasonably simple and they need to be smallish prints because at the moment we only have 1 MakerBot and a class of 18 or so. They need to be Things that dont take forever to print."
