function: "MakerBot Robot Competition\r\n\r\nThis is Frank, he is a MakerBot Robot V1.7_13. Frank is a robot designed to bridge the language gap between Humans and any possible Extraterrestrial life that tries to communicate with us.\r\n\r\nSince Frank toddled off the production line late 2011, he has been pondering a question while waiting to fulfill his purpose. The question he has been pondering is whether or not he should ponder the meaning of life or whether he should ponder how to level up his Caterpie in Pokemon. This question shall plague him for a while yet as Frank was build to Ponder and discover."
