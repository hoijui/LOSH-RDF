function: "The K1-Rap is a derivative of Dkennel's Pocket Printer.  I loved the design and idea of the Pocket Printer but was unable to get the \"slides\" working correctly.  Since I had 8mm smooth rods and lm8uu bearings on my Prusa, I decided to cannibalize it and start a new design based on the Pocket Printers basic shape.  \r\n\r\nCheck out: www.entropyprojects.blogspot.com for the full details.  \r\n\r\nI'll update this as I change things. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nDue to popular demand, I changed the name to include the build number.  Hopefully this clears things up."
