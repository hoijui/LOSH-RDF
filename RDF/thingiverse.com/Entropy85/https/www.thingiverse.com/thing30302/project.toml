function = "8 Hole Pickguard for Fender Telecaster w/neck pick up mounting holes.  \r\n\r\nThis was so close to fitting on my MendelMax 1.5, but ultimately I had to split it up to be able to print it.\r\n\r\nI'm still using my Prusa MK1 PCB heated bed, so if your bed is larger than that, you should be good with the full pickguard."
