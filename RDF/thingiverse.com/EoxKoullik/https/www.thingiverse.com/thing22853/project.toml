function = "The Infinity Garden is my personal version/derivation of the Kontinuum Garden designed by the Rasmussen brothers of Copenhagen, Denmark.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about their awesome project, or help fund them at this address: http://www.indiegogo.com/Kontinuumgarden\r\n\r\nPersonally, I thought their design could use a few tweaks, so I created this Thing as a Proof-of-Concept, and way to share my thoughts with them.  I don't mean to steal any of their thunder, and welcome them to utilize any and all of my ideas shown here!\r\n\r\nThe biggest improvement I have to offer is that everything in my design can be printed on a Makerbot Cupcake, Thing-O-Matic, or Replicator, thus encouraging maximum availability.\r\n\r\nMy design was made in SolidWorks, and I've included a .zip file containing all of my original files, assemblies, renderings, etc.  Feel free to experiment, modify, and create a neat Thing out of this!\r\n\r\nAgain, this is a PROOF-OF-CONCEPT only, so I didn't check out dowel sizes at the hardware store, or figure out many of the minute details.  So tweaking will be in order before anyone goes off printing this substantially print-intensive beast!"
