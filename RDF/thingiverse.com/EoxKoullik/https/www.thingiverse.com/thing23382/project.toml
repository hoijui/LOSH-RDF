I only downloaded it for free from TurboSquid.com, and wanted desperately to see it come to life.***\r\n\r\nThis is an incredibly detailed model of the famed Lost City of Atlantis, as depicted in the fantastic SciFi series, Stargate Atlantis.  It's level of detail is far beyond what I believe any fan to be capable of, which makes me wonder if it's the actual model from the show?! :D\r\n\r\nRegardless, it needs to be printed!  But alas, it is considerably beyond my ability to slice into printable build trays.  Is anyone out there up to the task? :D\r\n\r\nCheers!"
