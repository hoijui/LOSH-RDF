This is an incredibly detailed model of the famed Lost City of Atlantis, as depicted in the fantastic SciFi series, Stargate Atlantis.  It's level of detail is far beyond what I believe any fan to be capable of, which makes me wonder if it's the actual model from the show?! :D\r
\r
Regardless, it needs to be printed!  But alas, it is considerably beyond my ability to slice into printable build trays.  Is anyone out there up to the task? :D\r
