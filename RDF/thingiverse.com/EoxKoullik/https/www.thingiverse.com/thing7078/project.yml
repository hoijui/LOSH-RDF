function: The company for which I work has old Dell 1110 Laser Printers on almost every desk in the company.  As far as I can tell, their biggest flaw is that these little plastic flaps which push the paper down after it's printed and clear the output area for the next sheet, constantly break and cause a mess of paper collisions.  So after being tired of cleaning up the sheets which got pushed onto the floor and under the desk, I quickly drew up a replacement part that would be printable on my Thing-O-Matic.
