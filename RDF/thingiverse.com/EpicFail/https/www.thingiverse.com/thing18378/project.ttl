------------------------------\r
Whew, OK, this took a wile to put together, my computer has most definitely not been stable.\r
\r
As you can see the visual concept is derived from poisonous frogs, toads, and my weird ideas of what a monster should look like.  \r
\r
I decided to keep the shape simple, with as few extreme overhangs as possible, though skein forge's support creation works quite well where the troubled areas lie, \r
\r
 Checked it in netfab to make sure it was clean, and re-sized it to fit within a 100x100 printing surface.\r
I wish it had more on the technically innovative side of things  rather than artistic, but this is where my strengths lie.""" ;
