function: This is a gear that I was testing to see if the extrusions would yield an STL safe model. I went through a lot of options and found that it worked best if I used the Quadify Modifier in 3ds max after extruding the base shape. Applying the Quadify Modifier added the necessary polygons to the object's front and rear faces. Enabling me to use various shapes to shape merge the object and later extrude the faces.
