function = "Cooling fan adapter for running a line up to cool your keg taps.  Keep your beer cold.  This is a slightly modified file of another Thingiverse file so I cannot take much credit- only the application :)  Fits a 70mm fan.  \n\n*UPDATE* Although this did work I scrapped it in favor of a box style setup.  The funnel chokes the airflow way down and causes the fan to stall far too much."
