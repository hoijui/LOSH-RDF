function = "This is a test object for extrusion based systems that is quick to print and will exhibit a lot of ooze unless countermeasures are taken.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve been working on anti-ooze for my Bowden based extrusion system (which has a lot of oozing if you don\\'t do anything against it). Together with Nophead we\\'ve had particularly good results:\r\nhttp://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2009/11/hacking-with-erik.html\r\n\r\nThe latest version of my 3D-to-5D.php software solution checks whether a pull back is necessary. Segments that are very close to each other will not result in a pull back. If it\\'s further apart, it has time to ooze more. Also, I don\\'t want it to add too much to the build times.\r\n\r\nOther references:\r\n- Adrian\\'s response when also trying pullback (again):\r\n  http://blog.reprap.org/2009/11/end-to-ooze-ii.html\r\n- Nophead\\'s RepRap blog post:\r\n  http://blog.reprap.org/2009/11/end-to-ooze-and-support-material-found.html\r\n- Extruder valve\r\n  http://blog.reprap.org/2008/08/extruder-valve.html"
