    okh:function """This is an OpenSCAD parametric model for making THE timing pulley that you need. It's designed to generate a model printable without support material (observing the overhang rule of thumb).\r
\r
You can configure it to fit the belt that you're using. The pulley can be fixed to a threaded shaft with a nut. On one side the nut (the setting for an M8 hex nut is configured for you already) will sink into the pulley. If you tighten a nut on the other side as well it will be very well fixed.\r
\r
Another option is to use a set screw. You just specify the diameter of the screw and it will create a hub with a (capped) teardrop hole.\r
\r
The STL file included works well with the Synchroflex(R) timing belt,1500Lx10Wmm from RS (order code 474-5892), spliced in half (to 5 mm width). This way you'll have a very good belt driven system for about 4 euros per meter. The belt comes as a closed loop, but you may need to glue it to get it to the right length.\r
\r
Please share your settings in the discussion when you've tested it in combination with a commercial belt!""" ;
