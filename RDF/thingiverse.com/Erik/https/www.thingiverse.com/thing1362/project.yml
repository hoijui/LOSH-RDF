function: "This is an OpenSCAD parametric model for making THE timing pulley that you need. It's designed to generate a model printable without support material (observing the overhang rule of thumb).\r\n\r\nYou can configure it to fit the belt that you're using. The pulley can be fixed to a threaded shaft with a nut. On one side the nut (the setting for an M8 hex nut is configured for you already) will sink into the pulley. If you tighten a nut on the other side as well it will be very well fixed.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to use a set screw. You just specify the diameter of the screw and it will create a hub with a (capped) teardrop hole.\r\n\r\nThe STL file included works well with the Synchroflex(R) timing belt,1500Lx10Wmm from RS (order code 474-5892), spliced in half (to 5 mm width). This way you'll have a very good belt driven system for about 4 euros per meter. The belt comes as a closed loop, but you may need to glue it to get it to the right length.\r\n\r\nPlease share your settings in the discussion when you've tested it in combination with a commercial belt!"
