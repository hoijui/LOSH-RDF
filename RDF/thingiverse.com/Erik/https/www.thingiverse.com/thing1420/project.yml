function: "This is a printed spindle holder. It\\'s more than strong enough and still uses only a little plastic filament. It\\'s designed to accommodate the Bits From Bytes filament spindles. It\\'s not the cheapest source, but it\\'s really nice for various accents. Also, if you print toys, using colour really gives it the toy feeling :)\r\n\r\nThe one with the blue filament is my last iteration. It works really well. Also, there is little friction so skate bearings are definitely overkill for this application (which are used in my other spindle holder and the excellent derivatives by others)\r\n\r\nTip: just the A part will also work, especially when its a bit oversized it will be a bit convex. You can then put the spindle on its side and it will revolve like a carousel. It's slightly less reliable but much, much simpler.\r\n\r\nRelated blog post: Accessories evolution: Spindle holders!\r\nhttp://blog.erikdebruijn.nl/archives/123-Accessories-evolution-Spindle-holders!.html"
