The same coupling could be used on the other end (the extrusion, or hot end), or a special purpose (smaller) coupling could be designed to fit your specific extruder (one that also clamps the heater insulator).\r\n\r\nThe idea of turning a nut onto the PTFE tube comes from profounddevices. I really liked it so much that I replaced my previous design to incorporate this idea.\r\n\r\nI\\'m thinking of using the nut as part of an electrical switch to get feedback of when the pressure is fully released. This way you can put reversing functionality in the firmware without needing to configure it per material.\r\n\r\nThe concept of using a Bowden cable as guide was suggested and pioneered by Ed Sells. See his post here:\r\nblog.reprap.org/2009/04/bowden-extruder-concept.html\r\n\r\nIf you can print to high tolerances or don't mind some trial and error prints, you can use a 'push to fit' variant of this coupling:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3775"
