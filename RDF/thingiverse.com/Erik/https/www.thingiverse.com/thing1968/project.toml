function = "I saw Makerblock\\'s topic about the ball joint, I thought openSCAD was suitable and adviced it, but thought I\\'d give it a try myself. This is a very quick hack, but it can be easily modified since it\\'s just code.\r\n\r\nIn OpenSCAD, you can choose to see an animation of the ball joint in action. Do this by uncommeting \\\"demo();\\\" and commenting \\\"print();\\\". To print it, choose the latter, press F6 and export to STL.\r\n\r\nFor a very cool implementation of this 'part' used in a camera mount, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2631"
