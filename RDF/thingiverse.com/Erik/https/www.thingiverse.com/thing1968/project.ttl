\r
In OpenSCAD, you can choose to see an animation of the ball joint in action. Do this by uncommeting \\"demo();\\" and commenting \\"print();\\". To print it, choose the latter, press F6 and export to STL.\r
\r
For a very cool implementation of this 'part' used in a camera mount, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2631""" ;
