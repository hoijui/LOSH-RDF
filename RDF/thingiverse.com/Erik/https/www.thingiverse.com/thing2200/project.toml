function = "This is probably unconsciously inspired by my trip to NYC with its tall buildings. In Manhattan they really know how to make use of that third dimension! It has to do with scarce real-estate in the XY plane. This model has a very small footprint so you can print a lot of these in a small XY space. If you're short on horizontal real estate, go up!\r\n\r\nThe smaller footprint will also help you if you were having trouble with warping, you don't need a reliable raft for this print."
