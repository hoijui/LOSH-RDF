It has to do with scarce real-estate in the XY plane. This model has a very small footprint so you can print a lot of these in a small XY space. If you're short on horizontal real estate, go up!\r
\r
The smaller footprint will also help you if you were having trouble with warping, you don't need a reliable raft for this print.""" ;
