function: "This is a first example of this library which shows how easy it is to use it for Meccano(R) projects.\r\n\r\nThe code for this object was 5 lines in OpenSCAD! This is due to reuse of libraries. I hope this encourages people to use such libraries and perhaps create Lego to Meccano interfaces and such!\r\n\r\nSee the robot-tilt-webcam.scad file for the implementation. See the part this is derived from to find my original Meccano Lib. See ballJoint.scad for a ballJoint script. It is currently only used for the ball, but the joint can be used equally easily."
