function: "I removed these files from Thingiverse because I don't agree with Stratasys/Makerbot and because there's a better alternative.You can find them on their new home: YouMagine!  \nhttps://www.youmagine.com/designs/mirror-mounting-system  \n\nDoing it yourself is never more fun if you have an (Ultimaker) 3D printer! Last weekend I made some nice mirror mounts with a flexure latch.   \n\nThe mirror just 'snaps' right into place.   \n\nYou couldn't buy mounts that would fit this specific mirror, but you CAN design them and print them at home!  \n\nSame for window drapes (will upload in a minute). We had drapes at a specific length. Now we could just hang them on the wall instead of the ceiling, exactly at the right height, saving us from having to make the drapes 'longer', which is kind of hard to do."
