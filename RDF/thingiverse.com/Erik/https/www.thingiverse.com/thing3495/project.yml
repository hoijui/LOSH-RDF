function: "I'm getting married!!! Our guests get a piece of cake. But on every decent cake, there should be a cake topper! I wanted a personal cake topper. While looking on the Google 3D warehouse I found several, but none were satisfactory. I wanted a simpler model that was solid and which had a personal touch. The result is this (parametric) model with the following modules: bride, groom, arm, leg and hat. Everything is made from spheres, cylinders and cubes, as you can see in the exploded view.\r\n\r\nI made a little movie in OpenShot that documents the process:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzL391LfsvE\r\n\r\nWith some more details on my blog post here:\r\nhttp://bit.ly/flossWedding\r\n\r\nThe groom, without the hat is really a generic \\'man\\' figure. So you can reuse it and tweak the orientation of the arms and legs."
