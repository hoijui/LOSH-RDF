function: "This is the beginning of a class of generic clamps. They are parametric, so the position of the bolt hole, clamping diameter, length and thickness are configurable.\r\n\r\nFor now I\\'m just starting with the c-clamp, but I\\'m hoping to expand it to Y, y, d, p, a shaped clamps and have more configurable parameters (hopefully) with names that are intuitive to you. If this is just what you need and can\\'t wait, it\\'s okay to beat me to it :)\r\n\r\nPerhaps there's already a taxonomy or list of examples of such clamps and their shapes, if so, please point me to it so I can be compatible with it."
