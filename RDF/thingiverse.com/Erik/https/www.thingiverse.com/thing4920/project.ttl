The vertices were very much visible, so I subdivided them a few times and performed a smoothing operation in Meshlab (open source!). There are some other files by nicholasclewis that are not in this derivative post, so be sure to check out those, too!\r
The model is a little 'dirty' because I was still flushing out some black ABS which keeps coming out of the nozzle even after printing hundreds of grams of PLA. Also, this really made the extrusion less smooth than it could be.""" ;
