function = "I spent my last penny, so I needed to (p)improvise this thing :)\r\n\r\nNo seriously, the penny is the most expensive part of this bottle opener, so I decided to reduce its cost drastically.\r\n\r\nWell, actually, I simply didn't have any US coins at my disposal and even a penny makes for a pretty bulky bottle-opener, so I decided to use what every Mendel hacker has at least a few kilograms of: M8 washers I shaved of a few flats for this design to be printable in 9 minutes on my Ultimaker at 100 mm/s (0.3 solidity). With PLA this makes for a pretty strong bottle opener.\r\n\r\nThe .SCAD file just imports the original file by Nick Starno, and takes a few slices off it where it's not essential. I will do extensive testing with beer bottles :)\r\n\r\nThanks Nick, for the \"original derivative\"!\r\n\r\nSee the video of it being made and used, in 9 minutes!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tywVdUyxaUE\r\n\r\n9 minutes is the fastest I could print it without too much compromise in quality, it could be nicer if you have a little more patience. The opener does look better when you print it at around 70mm/s, and it'll take about 15 minutes."
