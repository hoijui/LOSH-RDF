\r
No seriously, the penny is the most expensive part of this bottle opener, so I decided to reduce its cost drastically.\r
\r
Well, actually, I simply didn't have any US coins at my disposal and even a penny makes for a pretty bulky bottle-opener, so I decided to use what every Mendel hacker has at least a few kilograms of: M8 washers I shaved of a few flats for this design to be printable in 9 minutes on my Ultimaker at 100 mm/s (0.3 solidity). With PLA this makes for a pretty strong bottle opener.\r
\r
The .SCAD file just imports the original file by Nick Starno, and takes a few slices off it where it's not essential. I will do extensive testing with beer bottles :)\r
\r
Thanks Nick, for the "original derivative"!\r
\r
See the video of it being made and used, in 9 minutes!\r

9 minutes is the fastest I could print it without too much compromise in quality, it could be nicer if you have a little more patience. The opener does look better when you print it at around 70mm/s, and it'll take about 15 minutes.""" ;
