I'm still working on that :)  \n\nThis is a parametric (OpenSCAD!) lead bender tool. It's very simple, but it works for me. I've also included a wider version that can be used to bend an entire strip. Currently it's set to the spacing on the PCB I'm soldering. You can adjust it to the width you want.  \n\nIt could be improved/derived in at least two ways:  \n- a version with many different widths. This is now done by HipsterLogic: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6703  \n- a little rim that allows you to bend a notch into the leads that keeps the components hanging in place on the PCB without having to bend the wires on the back of the PCB."
