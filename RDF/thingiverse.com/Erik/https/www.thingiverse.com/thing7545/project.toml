You can copy and edit this design by following this link:  \nhttps://tinkercad.com/p/acc0cc7b36eef1df  \n\nPrinted by an Ultimaker, for Ultimakers! We pre-twist the 6 endstop wires. This way, Ultimaker builders will save some time with assembly.  \n\nThis video shows how this part has undergone and passed extreme stress tests:  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPTIE9gWr0M"
