This is a simple tool to put in a hand-drill to twist pairs of wires to reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference), most notably though cross talk among wires that run alongside each other.  

It was designed in about 60 seconds in TinkerCAD. You can copy and edit this design by following this link:

Printed by an Ultimaker, for Ultimakers! We pre-twist the 6 endstop wires. This way, Ultimaker builders will save some time with assembly.  

This video shows how this part has undergone and passed extreme stress tests:
