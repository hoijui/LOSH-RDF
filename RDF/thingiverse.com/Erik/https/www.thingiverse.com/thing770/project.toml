So you print out a replacement!\r\n\r\nMore information on the game:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan\r\n\r\nI made them in Google Sketchup and resurfaced and exported them to STL with the excellent CADSPAN plugin.\r\n\r\nHere's a video of the 3D print:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2hnSq1qKxk"
