See the picture with the bright yellow post it on it... ( also here: http://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:1634 ). You can screw a nut onto the PTFE, which creates a very good connection. The extruder drive mechanism and/or hot end have to be designed with a T-slot to fit this Bowden cable.\r\n\r\n============\r\n\r\nHere's a video of it being printed: (first iteration, a bit coarse quality since I reduced backlash in my Darwin frame while I forgot to reduce it in my software backlash compensation algorithm)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ddmB9ScSbQ\r\n\r\nThis is a holder for a 4.67 mm PTFE cable that serves as a guide for the filament. The plastic feedstock will travel from a driving mechanism to the extrusion head, through this flexible tube. The PTFE, a.k.a. Teflon, a very low friction. This solution will allow you to have multiple extruders on your machine without the moving mass becoming too heavy. The lighter it is, the quicker you can move the heads, e.g. when you're not extruding. The machine will need less current to run the motors, it reduces stringing when not extruding. Even more so, it reduces the weight of the X-axis so much that a much simpler and lighter Cartesian bot is possible. The steel rods wouldn\\'t necessarily be needed, allowing a much larger ratio of self-replication. The Bowden cable itself could be printed in several modules that snap together. This guide could be lined with telfon-tape (available in every hardware store) that can be replaced when worn.\r\n\r\nIt has one major drawback. The need for a control mechanism that accounts for pressure on the filament is needed. The tube is a bit flexible, and so is the plastic filament. This makes the assembly a bit springy. But when you use a flow-control system that accounts for pressure, you will end up with much better quality. The extrusion starts and stops *very* sharply. You can do this by pulling back after extruding a segment. After that, you push it in as much as you pulled it back and simply start extruding again. You do need stepper based extrusion to adequately be able to control how much the filament is pushed into the extruder and pulled back out.\r\n\r\nThe concept of using a Bowden cable as guide was suggested and pioneered by Ed Sells.
