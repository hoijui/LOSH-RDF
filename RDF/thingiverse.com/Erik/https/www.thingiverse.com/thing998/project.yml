function: "Warning: This product is in the Alpha stage. Testing with real live cat has yet to commence!\r\n\r\nThere are many toys on thingiverse, but let's not forget our fellow non-human housemate.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple cat toy. It will roll around. Because of the difference in diameter of the middle section vs. the outer sections it will roll in circles. When it flips over it will start rolling the other way. \r\nSince it's in balance (at least the model is) it will also spin around its axis, hopefully.\r\n\r\nThe object is 10 cm on its longest side (The volume extruded is 41 cc)."
