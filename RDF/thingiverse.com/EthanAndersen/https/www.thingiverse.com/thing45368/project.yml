function: An iPhone 4s case that I designed in sketch up that snaps together for a tight fit. It provides great protection and is easy for customization. I made the back a little thick so it's very easy to emboss a custom logo and it makes for that thick secure feeling so you know your iPhone is protected. Also in sketch up the back is completely flat so all you have to do is basically trace a logo , paste it to the back, and use the Push/Pull tool.
