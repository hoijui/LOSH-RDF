function: "This is a very simple print, consisting of one distance for the Z-endstop, and four clamps to hold a 3 mm thick acrylic sheet onto your Replicator plattform, just like on the Replicator 2!\r\n\r\nThe benefit of PLA printing on an acrylic surface is that it bonds better to it, then to painters tape. This will reduce the risc of curling and warping considerably. Also, since the acrylic sheet ment to be used with this clamps is only 3 mm thick, after the print is done, you remove the sheet and gently bend it in different direction to loosen the print from the surface. That should make it easy to snap it off with your fingers. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you happen to run the extruders into the plattform, a acrylic sheet is much cheaper to replace then the aluminium platform.\r\n\r\nFurther more, since temperature and distance between nozzle and acrylic sheet matters, with this mod, you can actually get more control over how hard the part is bonded to the buildplate! That means for instance that you can print supported structures without a raft ( just reduce the space between the nozzle and buildplate alittle ) and the supportstructure still wont fall over. \r\n\r\nAlso, you cant control thoose really stubborn prints that never seem to stop curling. Just close the gap even further, and it will bond like nothing else. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
