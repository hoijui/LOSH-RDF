A pic of the first home-built version can be seen at http://www.flickr.com/photos/everydayinventors/5368101007/ .\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the AVR mcu, all parts are through-hole for ease of assembly.\r\n\r\nIf you don't wish to manufacture a bare PCB yourself, you can get one from BatchPCB: http://www.batchpcb.com/index.php/Products/61022"
