function: "While making an order at a large on-line parts supplier I added a hand-full of low-cost ATtiny13V microcontrollers to my order as an impulse buy.  It was only after my order arrived that I discovered I had accidentally ordered the SOIC version rather than the DIP version of this chip. No problem!  With a little work in EAGLE it is possible to design a small breakout board to convert the 8pin SOIC chip into a breadboard friendly 8pin DIL package with the added benefit of a reset switch and an in-system programming header.\r\n\r\nI haven't actually built this thing yet, so there are no guarantees it will work.  Next time I have a batch of prototypes manufactured I'll throw this design in also to test.  I'll update this post/thing accordingly.\r\n\r\nUpdate: it works."
