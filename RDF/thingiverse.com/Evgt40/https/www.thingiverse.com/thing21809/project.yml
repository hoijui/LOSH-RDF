function: "This wheel coin adorns my all electric GT-40 replica.  The wheels were originally from a late model Camero that had plastic hub caps.  Originally these caps had a coin with the Chevy logo on them.  \r\n\r\nIf you have and electric car and want to identify it as an EV, this is a nice little piece.\r\n\r\nSee the below link for images of its use.\r\nhttp://www.evmania.com/blog/2012/04/21/makerbot-ev-wheel-coins/#more-1763"
