function: "I just could not resist. Now your earphone winder is also a handy bottle opener!\r\n\r\nThe skull is now 2mm thicker than before to make it strong enough to open a bottle.\r\n\r\nI ran out of material on the last layer of this print as can be seen from the missing diagonal fill and outline. Despite that it still looks and works great. Enjoy!"
