\r
One can never have enough 3D-printers, so I decided to build some Huxleys.  \r
A lot of parts didn't fit or needed some improvements, so I ended up redesigning most of the machine.  \r
\r
Here's the result for the driver/extruder combination and a GRRF 3mm hotend ( https://shop.germanreprap.com/de/Modular-Hot-End-3mm ).  \r
\r
Hotend and bowden can easily be removed by only one or two screws.  \r
The fan is detachable, which comes in handy during machine calibration or to have better sight on the first printed layers.  \r
\r
The design has gone through many changes, but now it works like a charm.  \r

I am in no way affiliated to GRRF and just a customer who bought some stuff from them...""" ;
