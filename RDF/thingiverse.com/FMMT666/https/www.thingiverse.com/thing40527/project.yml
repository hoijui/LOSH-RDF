function: "Or in short \"DDGRRFHEBEFHWRF\" 8D  \r\n\r\nOne can never have enough 3D-printers, so I decided to build some Huxleys.  \r\nA lot of parts didn't fit or needed some improvements, so I ended up redesigning most of the machine.  \r\n\r\nHere's the result for the driver/extruder combination and a GRRF 3mm hotend ( https://shop.germanreprap.com/de/Modular-Hot-End-3mm ).  \r\n\r\nHotend and bowden can easily be removed by only one or two screws.  \r\nThe fan is detachable, which comes in handy during machine calibration or to have better sight on the first printed layers.  \r\n\r\nThe design has gone through many changes, but now it works like a charm.  \r\n\r\n\r\n===  \r\nFor the protocol:  \r\nI am in no way affiliated to GRRF and just a customer who bought some stuff from them..."
