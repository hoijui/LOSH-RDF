function = "this thing is to fit in fork pivot of motorcycles with a 17mm inner diameter pivot (can be easily adjusted for bigger).\r\nit has seven lights in it. \r\nlights will be seen only when blinking because of the thin layer of plastic in top of it.\r\n\r\nthread is custom profile with inf/45Â° angle shape\r\nleds are this type for the size, aviable in different colors and brightness: http://datasheet.octopart.com/L-13GD-Kingbright-datasheet-640398.pdf\r\nand each has its shape printed in the cap to fit perfectly\r\ndesign allow to maintenance leds and resistors(let wires be long enough before filling the bottom chamber with silicon).\r\n\r\ni wonder if it can be 3d printed, because of the many details it has in a so close space, \r\n\r\ni have designed this to fit perfectly on my '86 honda 500vtc custom motorcycle project.\r\nvisible here: \r\nhttp://www.customnetwork.fr/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&layout=blog&id=4&Itemid=29\r\n\r\nbut still not have access to a 3d printer, so if you are interessted in similar part for you an have the printer i can make mods to fit your bike if you could print this one for me. sounds like a good deal...\r\n\r\nUPDATE: after playing with replicatorg, i have found errors to make it printable on TOM so i update files for cleaner ones and one stl to make it in one build directly.\r\nstill can't print it, so please tell me if you do so."
