function = "Hello world,\r\n\r\nFirst start of this design was a simple fact: everybody have a bic ballpen at home, this model where ball point and cartridge come out easely (2nd picture)... \r\nAnd it finish his life most of the time with broken body and its rock solid point/ cartridge fully functionnal with more than half level of ink left.\r\n\r\nSo here is the (earth people) revolution! And the action where 3d printing for everyone take its sense--> print your favorite design of a body like this one, and simply fit the cartridge inside! You can get an original new pen without buying a new one, but recycling old one.pretty cool, isnt it?\r\n\r\nIt has an original shape with a side clip and... cerise sur le gateau(i am french) a cool makerbot logo on top!\r\n\r\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\nNEW!!!! just added a rendered animation to see it in (near)real!\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HBp9_Sodg                       \r\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\nOther story of it, i don't have access to a 3d printer. So i made it to be printed on thing o matic, paid attention to have details not less than 0.4mm and angles no more than 45' of the body, it is 120mm long and you can make several copies in one build (64 for TOM).  but i have no way to verify and eventually correct the final result!\r\nit can also be printed in the color you choose...\r\n\r\nWell, you might already be thinking of this fact: yes, i am very interessted in 3D printing and am running to win the new museum challenge!\r\nthanks for watching!"
