function = "This is a tool for bending lead of resistors and other components. Every line has a standard size, each slot is .05â€³ longer than the next and has radiused edges to make perfect bends without stressing the leads. It can be used to bend the leads of 1/2 watt resistors, 1/4 watt resistors, and diodes.\r\nEsta pieza es una herramienta para doblar patillas de resistencias. Cada hueco es multiplo de 2,54mm (el espaciado estandard de componentes). Puede ser usado para doblar resistencias de 1/2w ,1/4w o diodos."
