function = "This is a safety latch designed to secure drawers, cupboard doors, or other furniture to prevent young children from opening them. Commercially there is a wide variety in the design of these latches, however, I've kept this design to it's simplest and most utilitarian form.\r\n\r\nThis should be printable on most reprap printers. If your printer can't handle the screw holes at the base of the latch then you could fill them solid and screw through the plastic when attaching the latch.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress so I welcome your feedback, improvement, and derivative designs.\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad.\r\nEdit Part A online at: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc0011db8cb8e88\r\nEdit Part B online at: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc0e35af491e43d"
