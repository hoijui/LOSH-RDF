function = "I edited the wings and tail to look a bit more like a real plane, and added our fab lab's name and website on it. I made the slots very tight and you may need to alter the size of them depending on your laser's own cutting width. Use a file to resize the slots as needed. \r\n\r\nI also added a stand and removed the props and motor- The purpose of this Thing is to just make a simple gift for patrons."
