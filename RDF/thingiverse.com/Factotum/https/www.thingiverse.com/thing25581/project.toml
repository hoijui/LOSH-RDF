function = "OpenSCAD file for making draw dividers with a variable number of cells.  \n\nUpdated version is much easier to specify the total size of the divider and has rounded corners to make final fitting easier.  \n\nAs of V3.1 it now has a nice console output to give you info about the drawn job plus it has a CNC router output option that cuts the correct profile for the edge-lap joint (see http://makezine.com/2012/04/13/cnc-panel-joinery-notebook/ if you don't follow).  \n\nV3.2 addresses some issues with offsets created my the minkowski function."
