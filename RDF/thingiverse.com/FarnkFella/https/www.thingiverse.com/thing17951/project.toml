I modeled it using Blender using the image on Wikipedia as reference.  \r\n\r\nI plan on adding a scale pattern in the future, but right now the resolution of my printer won't handle it.\r\n\r\nIt would be cool to see some prints at higher resolution.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Uploaded a new 2-color compatible version which has been made solid and been smoothed using meshmixer."
