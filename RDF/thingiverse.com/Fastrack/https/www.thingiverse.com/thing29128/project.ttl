\r
This new script homes all axis', moves Z down .5mm, moves the carriage/right nozzle to "stored centre" and allows you to adjust it if required.  I've also adjusted the Z speed as suggested on Google Groups by someone (I don't remember who).\r
\r
I've read many posts on this issue, it's been suggested to position the carriage centre (ie between the dual nozzles), but that doesn't work either.\r
\r
This script may work with a Replicator Single as well, but I can not verify that.""" ;
