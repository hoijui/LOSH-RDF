function: "I've posted topics asking how to come up with the proper print temperature and read many posts as well.  All that came back or what I read was \"do it by trial and error\", no one really gave any direction.  The more I thought about it, the correct print temperature has to result in the highest bond strength.\r\n\r\nSo I developed this... The base is 25mm x 5mm, spindle is 10mm x 40mm."
