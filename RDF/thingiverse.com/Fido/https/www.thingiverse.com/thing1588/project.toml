ARGH) \r\nI have a part of ghero drumset in front of sensorbar and it sometimes blocked the line of sight to the sensorbar and it F\\'d up my gameplay. \r\nThere were few times I really wanted to send the 50â‚¬ controller combo to the earth orbit through the tv set because of that.\r\nThis contraption solved that. \r\nThis raises the sensor bar 35-100mm over the possible obsticles (and closer to the tv screen)\r\n\r\n(it stays up because of the friction from the clips clamping down to the wiibar)"
