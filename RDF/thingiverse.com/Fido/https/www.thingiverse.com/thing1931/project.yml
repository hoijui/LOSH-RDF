function: "Printable mouse trap for the Cathals Mouse Trap challenge.\r\n\r\nThis mouse trap combines the both desires of the mouse; the love for exercise wheels and peanut butter (and ours for catching those buggers). \r\n\r\nIdea is simple. Trap spreads the aroma of the bait from the openings at the sides of the wheel. \r\nThe mouse then goes in to the wheel from the hole and in inside tries to reach the bait from the opposite side of the wheel. \r\nThen the weight of the mouse turns the eccentric wheel and rotates it over 90 degrees, locking it in place and blocking the exit. \r\nWeight of the mouse acts as a locking mechanism.\r\n\r\nNot yet tested but in my mind it works. \r\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcfwgj_exercise-wheel-mousetrap_animals\r\n\r\nUPDATE: In previous zip file, one file got corrupted at some point and did not work. This has been fixed now in the MouseTrap.zip -file. In the MouseTrapBPlat.zip are resized stl files that are for people who have build platfrom bolts still installed. \r\nI don't know how these flaws got past me unnoticed and I apologize for the lack of quality control. \r\nBig thanks to Cathal for bringing these to my attention. \r\n\r\nUPDATE #2: Lesson learned. Never know what to anticipate when you're not printing these yourself. Nothing big but the orientation for the other foot was wrong, too big to print that way. Fixed now in the mousetrap.zip\r\n\r\nUPDATE #3: Finally uploaded a video of this in action. Sorry for the wait :)\r\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/xfdi0y_better-mousetrap-challenge-test-vid_tech\r\n\r\nUPDATE #4 (summer 2020): Big thanks to youtuber Shawn Woods for testing this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUumJSrx4gE Results were not so promising but do Subscribe to him! :)"
