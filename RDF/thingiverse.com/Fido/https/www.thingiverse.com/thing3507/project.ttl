I didn\\'t have enough money to get my own (well budgeted trip ;). I thought \\"Oh well.. no worries thou, I have a Makerbot. I\\'ll make my own and with some improvements.\\" \r
\r
So I decited to create a travel version of the game. Not like the big and bulky one they sell over there but small,\r
sleek and pocket size. Something you can take with you on travels and stuff. \r
\r
And also I wanted to design it so that you wouldn\\'t need extra parts to assemble it. \r
(If you own a makerbot, you can make this in the middle of the desert if needed)\r
\r
\r
(and for a added bonus. I included one extra set of game pieces that read instead of \\"Jackpot\\" but \\"TheGame\\")\r
\r
For this you can either use jmil:s dices that has more realistic corners ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:925 ) or mine that has sharp corners.""" ;
