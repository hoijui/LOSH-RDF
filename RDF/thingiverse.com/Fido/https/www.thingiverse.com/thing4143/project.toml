function = "Magnetic pool cue chalk holder that clips on to your belt. \r\nOnce saw someone use similar and thought that would be easy to create Makerbot style. \r\nAs for a magnets I had a 20x2mm disk type neodymium magnets at my disposal. Strong enough to clip together thru a shirt. \r\nThe chalk cube itself fits snuggly in the box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*If enough interest I can (or anyone else) modify the design to use the 3mm cube magnets that makerbot sells, but since I don't have those at hand I can't verify if they'll work."
