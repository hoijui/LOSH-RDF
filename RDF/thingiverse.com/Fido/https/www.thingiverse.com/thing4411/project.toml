function = "Just in time for Halloween! Ghostly glow in the dark keyring. \r\nAttach your car/house keys to this and you'll be able to locate them in total darkness. If lost in forest/dark areas, just use UV flashlight to sweep the surroundings and your keys just pop out.\r\n\r\nStrong enough to handle everyday use (2mm thick) and not too big for the pocket. \r\n\r\nDesigned to be printed with glow in the dark plastic but works well as keyring with different colors too.\r\n\r\nFast to print (~10min), so if you're owner of ABP, you'll be able to equip your whole family with these never-to-lose keyrings in notime."
