function = "Have a spooky vampire style glow in the dark evil eyes earrigns for halloween parties.\r\nAt far they'll look like (bloody)vampire teeth and at close the observer also gets the stare of the evil eyes. \r\n\r\nTwo different eyes. The one with plastic eye whites probably works better with the glow in the dark stuff. The other with normal plastic.\r\n\r\nAlso makes a great present!"
