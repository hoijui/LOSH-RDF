    okh:function """Glowing mushroom for your desktop that is powered by any colored LED and batteries(or usb).   
The legend says that:   
- Green mushrooms are magical  
- Blue mushrooms are ghostly  
- Red mushrooms are poisonous / viking fuel ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria )  
Designed to be printed with PLA and to fit 2x 2032 lithium 3v batteries, a switch, led and a resistor. The leg of the mushroom is hollowed (3mm) for the wires and the resistor.   
Batteries are neatly hidden under the base. Switch is behind the base.  
Works ok as a ornament when printed with nontransparent plastic.  
(as a side idea the glow was to be produced with a UV led and with a glow in the dark plastic..could still work)""" ;
