function: "Glowing mushroom for your desktop that is powered by any colored LED and batteries(or usb).   \nThe legend says that:   \n- Green mushrooms are magical  \n- Blue mushrooms are ghostly  \n- Red mushrooms are poisonous / viking fuel ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria )  \nDesigned to be printed with PLA and to fit 2x 2032 lithium 3v batteries, a switch, led and a resistor. The leg of the mushroom is hollowed (3mm) for the wires and the resistor.   \nBatteries are neatly hidden under the base. Switch is behind the base.  \nWorks ok as a ornament when printed with nontransparent plastic.  \n(as a side idea the glow was to be produced with a UV led and with a glow in the dark plastic..could still work)"
