function: "When printing very high prints, sometimes the \"not-so-often-used\" parts of z axis rods get dusty and cause skipping. \r\nThis is designed to increase the belt-pulley contact and thus increase the friction -> less skipping.\r\n\r\nDesigned to use the 623 bearings (the same as mendel inspired lowrider by twotimes.) \r\n\r\n\r\nEven when this is in place I recommend to oil the rods regularly with some gun/sewing machine oil. This too helps reduce skipping."
