function: "After the trouble with the magnets and the old carriage I thought this might need the clamps as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the help of the added bolts the platform slides down firmly to its place and gets lock down with the lever on the right hand side.\r\nWhen closed the lever is equal with the platform edge and is nicely hidden out of the way."
