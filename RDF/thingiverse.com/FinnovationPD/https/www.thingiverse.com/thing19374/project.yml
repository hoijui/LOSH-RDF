function: This is a design I came up with for a business card solution. It is meant to showcase the capabilities of a 3D Printer to my potential clients. This business card is printed in 1 piece, and is completed fully assembled with 3 internal moving parts. Our company logo is on the front, and your personalized info can be included into the final design! Check out www.finnovationpd.com for your 1 stop 3d Printing needs.
