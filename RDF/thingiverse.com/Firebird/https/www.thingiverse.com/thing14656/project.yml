function: "A 'placeholder' is a term given in the 3D film and game industry for a temporary model used to represent a final character or item before that item is finished.\r\nThis is a placeholder of a 50g servo that I use when I am layout out the components for a robot or radio control project in 3D CAD. I have tried to make it as close as possible to the specimen servo (futaba) as necessary. \r\n\r\nA solid 3D representation of a common 50g servo used in many hobby projects. Great for CAD assemblies for robot or RC car projects."
