function = "Coffin for D&D, 2\"x1\". The lid will snap shut as long as your filament size is properly specified.  Printed on a Replicator. Since it's hollow, you can put items, gold, or enemies in it for your PCs to find.  On the last photo, you can see me holding it upside down with the lid staying in place."
