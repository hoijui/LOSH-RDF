Thanks. I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI don't know which licence is suitable, because I borrowed some code and don't know how to inherit their licenses.\r\nExcept it, you can copy and modify this script. \r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nv01 - changed cylinder function to 200_gon_prizm, so bolt holes turn to smoother.\r\nV02 - applied \"Incomplete Polygons\" design ( http://blog.makerbot.com/2010/12/13/design-tip-incomplete-polygons/ ) and ( http://blog.makerbot.com/2010/12/13/incomplete-polygons-â€“-a-dramatization/ ). Four holes has 0.1mm slices to avoid blobs. Rounded corners. Holes were enlarged by 5%, reflected a sugestion by kitsu. So no need to drill out holes.\r\nV03 - changed licence to Creative Commons - GPL license.\r\nV04 - modified teardrop function for smoothness. added STL file."
