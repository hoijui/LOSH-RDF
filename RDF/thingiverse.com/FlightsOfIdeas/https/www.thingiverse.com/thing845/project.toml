function = "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI thought that SketchUp users may appreciate a plugin that makes the exporting of 3D models to 2D vector graphics a bit easier. The plugin (ruby scripts) allows the user to select SketchUp faces and export the oulines of these faces to a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file.\r\n\r\nThe plugin was developed to help with constructing designs for laser cutting, but I know of people who use it for CNC routing as well.\r\n\r\nThis latest version of the plugin hasn\\'t been tested with any laser cutting yet (I\\'m working on some designs at the moment), but I know how Thingiverse users like to be on the bleeding edge ;-P"
