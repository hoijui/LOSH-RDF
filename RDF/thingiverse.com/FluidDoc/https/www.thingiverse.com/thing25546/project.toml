function = "This is another thing that I came up with while waiting for my printer.  It was originally a dodecahedron, but kinda got out of control.  You tell me what it is exactly.  Again, created in Rhino, and the files are included.  If anyone gives it a go, let me know how it turns out.  I'm not exactly sure if those overhangs are reasonable or not without support.\r\n\r\nI also couldn't resist playing around with the rendering, so I included a nice picture."
