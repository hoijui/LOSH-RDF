function: "This is just a more complex polygon version of the Turner's Cube.  A friend made me a cube with his CNC machine years ago, and since then I've always wanted to make one like this.  \r\n\r\nThere are some pretty tough overhangs on here.  Perhaps it would be a little better with a solid base."
