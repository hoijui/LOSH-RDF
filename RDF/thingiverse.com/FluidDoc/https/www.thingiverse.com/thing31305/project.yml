function: "I wasn't really happy with the built in spool holder on the M2, so I came up with this one.  I think it works much better for the heavier spools.  It is designed to hold the 5lb and 1kg spools from Ultimachine.  It uses the existing hardware, and I kept the upper bearing holder from the original mount to keep the filament guide in place.\r\n\r\nThis was modeled Rhino.\r\n\r\nEdit:  Added a 1\" diameter version (untested)"
