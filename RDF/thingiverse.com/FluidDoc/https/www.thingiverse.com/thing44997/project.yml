function: This is an alternative to GoPro's roll bar mount, which has huge posts sticking out the back and does not have the necessary degrees of freedom to get the camera level on an angled bar, such as the A-pillar.  This addresses both of those issues by using zip ties to secure it and adding a swivel to account for skewed angles.  Sized to fit a 1.75 inch tube, although slightly smaller or larger should still work fine.
