I still had that horrible feeling that I would have to go out and buy a new dishwasher. But the v2 I posted here is the one I use today. Fit like a factory part!\r\n\r\nThe part in the picture above was v1 and was printed in the wrong layer orientation. The v2 is much stronger because of the grain of the plastic."
