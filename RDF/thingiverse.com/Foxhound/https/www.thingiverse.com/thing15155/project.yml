function: "This is the reason I built my RapMan :D\r\n\r\nI've made a shell to go around a (heavily modified) Nerf Stampede to make it look like a 40k Bolter.\r\n\r\nIt's still fully functional, shoots darts and takes standard Nerf magazines (one day I'll do the Bolter magazine too)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it'll always be more a decorative piece, mostly due to it weighing 4kgs, making far too heavy to lug around all day during wars or HvZ :P\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot quite sure what's going on in the preview images for the .STL's, They printed out ok after a bit of rotating in Axon\r\n\r\n\r\n(Obligatory Note: I don't own Nerf, or anything relating to GamesWorkshop/Warhammer, etc, I'm just a big fan of both)"
