    okh:function "This marker rack has been created for industrial design purposes. Sketching with markers requires to act quickly before the ink gets dry. If you make a gradient, you need to use different tones of markers and mix them together on the paper. Often you are looking for a precise markers, you know it is somewhere on your table but you were too busy with your drawing to notice where you put it. So now your searching and your drawing is drying. You could use the plastic case included with the markers, but it's often not stable enough, hard to insert the markers pen in (quickly I mean) and the markers are always too close to one each other. So I made the Circular Markers Holder. It is easy to insert the markers in, you can easily read the value of each pen, the whole thing rotates super easy; you can spin it and grab the desired value in a fraction of a second." ;
