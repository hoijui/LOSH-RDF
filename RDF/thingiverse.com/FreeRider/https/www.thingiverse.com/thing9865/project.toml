function = "I needed a handle for my stainless espresso tamp.  The price of these things is quite a bit for what is essentially a hunk of plastic so I figured this would be a perfect time to design the 1st custom part my 3D printer would make.\r\n\r\nSee video of the build process on my thingomatic:\r\n\r\nhttp://vimeo.com/25993602\r\n\r\nIt works amazingly well and fits perfectly into the stainless end.  The only change I would make if I were to do it again would be to try my hand at designing some plastic threads to match with the included steel bolt...as it stands it works perfectly well using the bolt to cut its own threads into the handles base mounting hole."
