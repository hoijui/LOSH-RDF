function: "This is a derivative of K1nc81d's printed fan mount. The only difference is that this one is laser cut from the same material that the rest of the printrbot is cut from.\r\n\r\nMy printrbot wasn't up and running yet, and I couldn't wait to put a fan on there so I laser cut this one out of the left over material from when I cut my Printrbot LC.\r\n\r\nI went through 5 revisions on my design before I got something that was stable enough to hold the fan without wobbling and the carriage wouldn't crash into the fan once mounted. At first I just cut a press fit tab/hole connection and dabbed a drop of wood glue on there.\r\nI wanted to avoid the use of glue so the final design you see here secures the connection with a captured M3 nut in the holder and a screw that self threads through the base.\r\n\r\nThis is my very first published thing, so please have patience with me as I may not structure the text and explenations in the way you are used to.\r\nFeel free to leave comments."
