\r
So, instead of wrangling with getting a new ceiling lamp or using bent pieces of wires to hold the glass cover (dangerously!) in place, did a quick 3d model of the missing piece based on the existing ones, and got a pretty good enough holder clip again! =)\r
\r
Now we can lose all the pieces with impunity!\r
\r
Hope this helps anyone who else who happens to be missing this part! ;)\r
