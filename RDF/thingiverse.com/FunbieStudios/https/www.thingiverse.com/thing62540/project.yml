function: "Kind of had the bad luck of losing one of the clips on the IKEA PULT Lamp (at least I think that what it is called - http://www.ikea.com/sg/en/catalog/products/90192900/)\r\n\r\nSo, instead of wrangling with getting a new ceiling lamp or using bent pieces of wires to hold the glass cover (dangerously!) in place, did a quick 3d model of the missing piece based on the existing ones, and got a pretty good enough holder clip again! =)\r\n\r\nNow we can lose all the pieces with impunity!\r\n\r\nHope this helps anyone who else who happens to be missing this part! ;)\r\n\r\n(PS: A longer writeup of this is over here - http://funbiestudios.com/2013/03/3d-printing-a-replacement-clip-for-the-ikea-pult-ceiling-lamp/)"
