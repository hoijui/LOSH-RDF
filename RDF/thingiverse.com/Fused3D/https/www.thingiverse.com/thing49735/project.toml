The print uses the leveler thing plus whpthomas Rep2 ReplicatorG 200 micron profile.\r\n\r\nSo this specific print I believe is .1mm thick (don't think you can make real wood veneer this thin).  You can see through to the grain in the underlying bamboo flooring\r\n\r\nThe Veneer sheet feels a little rough, almost like finger prints but just slightly rougher."
