function: "Thanks to whpthomas and his thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39430\r\n\r\nThis print uses www.fused3d.com Cherry Wood Filament (LAYWOO-D3 1.75mm), which is PLA compatible (No heated bed)\r\n\r\nI was able to level my print bed with awesome results on the Replicator2!  The print uses the leveler thing plus whpthomas Rep2 ReplicatorG 200 micron profile.\r\n\r\nSo this specific print I believe is .1mm thick (don't think you can make real wood veneer this thin).  You can see through to the grain in the underlying bamboo flooring\r\n\r\nThe Veneer sheet feels a little rough, almost like finger prints but just slightly rougher."
