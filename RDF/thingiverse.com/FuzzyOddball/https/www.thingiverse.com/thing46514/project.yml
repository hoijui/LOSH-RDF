function: "Ivy Pendent.\r\n1\" wide by 2\" long pendent flower pot, with living ivy growing out of it.\r\nIvy is not printed but planted into the printed pot.\r\nThe pendent it self is interchangeable creating the ability to mix and match different potted plants with ones mood, or wardrobe.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of costume and jewellery accessories I am making. \r\nThe series combines Organic matter and Technology to create simple and provocative jewellery and adornments for ones clothing, and ones self. The project is meant so that no matter where one goes, an individual may carry with them a little piece of nature with them. Plants have known to effect mood especially in city's where green spaces benefit an individuals health, and can aid in relieving stress. Not everyone in there day can get to a green space due to many contributing factors, but with a few minutes a day one can grow and express their own personal green space."
