function: "The following was inspired by a book from the 50's which showed individuals how to make models out of balsa. This is the Printable version of it. I do not have access to a printer large enough to test this model, and hope others maybe able to fine tune it.   \n\nBased on a comment made I am updating this description to include the scale factor for 1:1 scale in Cura; 25.4  \n\nThe models are all made in AutoCad in inches.   \nCura imports/works in MM."
