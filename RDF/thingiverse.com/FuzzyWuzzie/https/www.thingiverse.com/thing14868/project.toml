function = "I love the Custom-Cookie-Cutter-Generator made by Guru, but I found it was rather difficult to use, especially when trying to add / remove nodes. So, I made some usability changes:\r\n\r\n* Current selected node is highlighted in red\r\n* When moving a node, it picks the node closest to the mouse, not just ones that are 4px away\r\n* Increased the height / depth of the cutting part for thicker rolls of dough\r\n* New nodes are now placed at the mouse cursor in a logical clockwise order instead of at a semi-arbitrary location\r\n* Removing a node now removes the node closest to the mouse\r\n* Added a basic scaling feature: up arrow scales the entire node set by 110%, down arrow scales the entire node set by 90%.\r\n* Made it so the file open/save dialogues all remember the last location you used them (super handy if you're not working in \"My Documents\").\r\n\r\nAll props to Guru for making the original one though!\r\n\r\nThere are still some things I wouldn't mind implementing when I have time:\r\n* Automated \"smoothing\" by inserting new nodes to round things out\r\n* Clean up the load / save / export functions so that proper file extensions are used, etc\r\n* More stuff that I forgot..\r\n\r\nAlso, to use this, you need the unlekkerlib for processing. You can download it at: http://codeandform.googlecode.com/files/unlekkerLib0003c.zip . To make it work, create a folder called \"libraries\" in your Processing folder (where the sketches are stored), and unzip the unlekkerLib folder into that libraries folder."
