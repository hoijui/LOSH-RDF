function: "**Untested project for the MakerBot Giveaway contest. I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve got no clue about how sturdy MakerBot printed parts are, this means that I don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t know if the parts I designed are thick enough to support the weight of the camera and steppers. I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m maybe plain wrong ! However, parts size have been carefully designed to fit into Makerbot\xE2\u20AC\u2122s build envelope. The only overhangs are holes, therefore the parts should be printable on a MakerBot (At least, I hope !). STL parts have been checked with Netfabb and are manifold EDIT:I reuploaded the STL parts. They are now oriented in build direction**\r\n\r\nThis half automatic pano head has been designed to take pictures using a Canon Powershot A560 compact digital camera. The purpose is to shoot panoramas without getting into the risk of forgetting to take THE PICTURE absolutely needed to get a complete panorama (when you don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t have got a wide angle lens, you need to take a lot of pictures!)... The head moves left/right and up/down. Two NEMA 17 sized stepper motors are controlled by an Arduino  (or compatible clone) using two Sparkfun\\'s Easydriver. The shutting mecanism will be controlled by Arduino.\r\n\r\nThe Canon Powershot\xE2\u20AC\u2122s normally don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t have remote shutting capabilities. Fortunately, a great open source software package can add a lot of functionalities to these cameras: CHDK. It adds remote shutting by detecting when voltage is applied on camera usb port.\r\nThis head has to be mounted on a standard tripod.\r\nFunction: When pressing the start/stop button, the camera will take a picture (or more, if CHDK \xE2\u20AC\u0153bracketing in continuous mode\xE2\u20AC\x9D is checked \xE2\u20AC\u201C needed for HDR), then moves upward, takes a picture,\xE2\u20AC\xA6 , then moves left,then moves downwards, takes a picture, \xE2\u20AC\xA6 ,and it does the same column after column. When the necessary pictures have been taken, the photograph has to press the start/stop button. After, the reset button has to be pressed to put the pano head back in starting position (only horizontal axis needs to be moved).\r\n\r\nAdvantages of this design:\r\n-No need to carry a notebook to control this head. \r\n-Simple to use.\r\n\r\ndrawbacks of this design:\r\n - the row/column intervals and time between moves can only be changed by editing the arduino sketch. \r\n- No care taken about \xE2\u20AC\u0153No-parallax point\xE2\u20AC\x9D for now.\r\n\r\nSoftware used:\r\n3D CAD: Alibre Design http://www.alibre.com/\r\nRenderings: SimLab Composer 2 http://www.simlab-soft.com/\r\nNetfabb (STL file checking + repair): http://www.netfabb.com/\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n Hugin (panorama stitching and more): http://hugin.sourceforge.net/\r\nArduino: http://www.arduino.cc/\r\nCHDK (Unleash the POWER in your Canon PowerShot!): http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK"
