function: "Organize your botspace with this modular set of parts to build shelving and tool holders for the TOM.  (My first Thing!)\r\n\r\nThere are two shelf modules here -- a closed-ended and an open-ended design, and two lengths of brackets.  Pics show all of these in use.\r\n\r\nThis system of parts works on the same clip principle as Thing 6951, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6951 but I've been working on these parts independently for a couple of months (since I first got my TOM), so it's an example of \"convergent evolution\" rather than derivation, I think."
