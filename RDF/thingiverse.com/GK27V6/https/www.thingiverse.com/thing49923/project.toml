function = "This concept was my submission for the Makerbot Replicator 2 Design Challenge.  \n\n\n\nIn the year 2040 it is expected for autonomous vehicles to be commonplace. There are, however, countless individuals who cannot live without a fundamental driving experience. As material sciences and technologies vastly advance in the next few decades, astounding new vehicle designs are possible.  \n\nThis concept features a rigid, lightweight construction and is entirely operated with by-wire technology. The electronic steering and propulsion systems allow for an intuitive, direct experience. As well, the suspended seats rotate with the car when turning for enhanced visibility. The driver is directly connected to the road."
