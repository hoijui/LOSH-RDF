function: "I always wanted a helping hand, even though some are really ship, I never bought one. Then I stumbled on dougc314 thing. But I hadn't any aligator clips, well I decided that this time I would get my extra helping hand!!\r\nSince I already had been fooling with clothpegs in a previous thing, it was rather easy to build that stuff in Blender."
