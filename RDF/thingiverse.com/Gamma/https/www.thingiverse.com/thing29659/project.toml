function = "This is a clip and simple mount for a FreeTrack Project based headset clip. \r\nThe Clip is designed around 5mm cubed IR LEDs I've sourced from used equipment. I see no reason normal IR LEDs could not be used though.\r\nWire channels of 1mm depth are part of the design along with a relatively large central mounting point for alternative mounting methods and wiring."
