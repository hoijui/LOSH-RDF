function: "One of the mods that can be done to either the MS Pro of MS1 headphone by Alessandro is to use the Grado 1000 ear pads on them.  But to do this and make them sound good, a coupler has to be used.  Typically these are called distancers.\r\n\r\nSee this thread on Head-Fi for more details.\r\nhttp://www.head-fi.org/forums/f4/alessandro-ms1000-ms-ultimate-diy-modding-56k-warning-323271/\r\n\r\nThe diagram comes from the same forum thread.\r\n\r\nThe design is based on the suggested dimensions and includes 3x 1.5mm holes as ventilation."
