function = "I needed a bunch of brackets to hold small high voltage supplies in place for a rack of discharge (spectral emission) tubes I have. \r\n\r\nI got the tubes at an antique store, and wired up a separate ~2kv supply for each. There's also a TTL signal to control the bank from a microcontroller. \r\n\r\nThis was my first project with Alibre cad, to make it parametric. I found it a great tool to use, and it's now my method of choice."
