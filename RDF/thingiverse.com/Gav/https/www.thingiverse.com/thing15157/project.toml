function = "This is a set of button boxes for use on large CNC machines for emergency stop (E-STOP) applications.\r\n\r\nThe spindle control is for passing through power to a router, so it has a power switch and an easily press-able emergency stop.  The two other boxes go back to the PC and are used to stop motion on the X, Y & Z axes. \r\n\r\nThe electronic parts are all available from Altronics in Australia, but I'm sure other vendors have compatible stuff. Check their datasheets to see if the mountings are the same or just delete and add a new one. \r\nS3228 - Rocker switch , Neon.  (27.5mm by 13.6mm square mounting)\r\nS0820 - E-stop buttons, (16mm dia hole.)\r\nP8241 - GPO outlet, flush mountable. (most of a 33.5 mm dia circular hole and 4.5mm dia offset hole)\r\n\r\nThe box designs came from here. Check it out, well worth the $12. \r\nhttp://www.frag-den-spatz.de/shop/boxgenerator/boxdesigner.html"
