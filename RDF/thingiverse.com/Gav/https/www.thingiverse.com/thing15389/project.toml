function = "This is a box for Mitch Altman's Brain Machine. I liked the kit, but thought that it really needs something to keep all the exposed parts safe from being bumped when not in use.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\n\r\nThe waves on the top of the box are examples of brain waves. From the most noisy to least they are Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta. The order is the rough progression that the brain machine takes from wakefullness to rest.\r\n\r\nThe blobs were hatched using the EggBot hatching tool for inkscape, very handy.\r\n\r\nThe zener cards are just for fun. Sadly arduino based projects do confer psychic powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\nA few of the elements I got from open source SVGs floating around. \r\nZener cards:\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Cartas_Zener.svg\r\nBrain wave examples:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography\r\nBrain Note:\r\nhttp://openclipart.org/detail/19500/monstara_Brain_Notes\r\nG-clef:\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/GClef.svg\r\n60-hexagon spiral:\r\nhttp://openclipart.org/detail/148501/60-hexagon-spiral-by-10binary\r\n\r\nThe base box design was generated here: (Check it out, well worth the $12)\r\nhttp://www.frag-den-spatz.de/shop/boxgenerator/boxdesigner.html"
