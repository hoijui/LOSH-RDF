function: "The hackerspace toilet doesn't have a fan, and the door is thin, meaning that noise can be heard outside. Generally people outside don't want to hear what's inside, and those inside don't want their noise to reach outside. \r\n\r\nThe Japanese, being infinitely more civilised, have solved this problem with sophisticated robo-toilets that provide soothing covering noise such as waterfalls, beach sounds and others. \r\n\r\nGiven we can't afford a robo-toilet, here's a low cost solution using a Buddha box I had laying around. With the mere flick of a switch, using the bathroom becomes a soothing and meditative experience."
