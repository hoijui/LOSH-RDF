function = "This is a lasercut plate to hold a breadboard and an arduino mega or uno, plus some dials and switches. It allows for easy prototyping and demonstrations on the go. \r\n\r\nMy idea with this is to lower the boundary to testing and prototyping my ideas as quickly as possible. If I have to make a circuit board, or start soldering to test something, I'll be much less likely to do it than if I can just plug everything in in a few seconds."
