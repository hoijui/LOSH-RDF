function = "Here's a set of Girih tiles, as well as a box to hold them in. Based on these:\r\nLasercut Girih tiles\r\nWhich were popularly used in Islamic architecture. \r\n\r\nI find these more pleasant and fun to play with than Penrose tiles, as you're less constrained and don't have to worry about breaking edge conditions. They also look lovely when tiling a surface as the knotwork stands out while the joins are quite subtle."
