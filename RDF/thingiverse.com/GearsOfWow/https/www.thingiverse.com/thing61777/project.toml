function = "Now with improved grip control and added slicing edges.  Tape beware, your time has come!\r\n\r\nUnless you own a fancy tape dispenser; you only have two options with tape. Either fold the end over and discard that piece when you need a new length. Or you can orbit the tape repeatedly, using eyes and fingernails to locate and pry up the tape end. I give you option three, the Tape Tap. Adhere the tape end to this tap and save yourself some trouble."
