function: "I found George playing his part in an installation at the front of Dunkers Kulturhus in Helsingborg, Sweden.  George and his Funny Bunny mates made me laugh so hard I fell over.\r\n\r\nI asked George the Funny Bunny nicely if he would mind if I took some photos of him and try my luck at making a 3D model in his image so I could look at them every day on my desk.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can find out who the original artist is please let me know I'd like to give credit."
