function: "Keep those decks in slick sleeves from sliding all over the table!\r\n\r\nCard holder for playing collectable card games. Will fit standard sized cards in sleeves, up to a deck of about 60 cards.\r\n\r\nTested at Friday Night Magic last night, works great. Only one or two people specifically asked about it, though- I guess 3d printers really are starting to become ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nI may do an EDH/Commander sized version (100 cards), but feel free to beat me to the punch or add some improvements if you want. There's a lot of deck boxes for sleeved cards on thingiverse, but I didn't find anything that will let you casually dispense them as you play, so I designed one myself."
