function: "This knob is modeled after those on my stove, but scaled down to 80% in order to fit better with the children's kitchen set for which this is intended. Will friction fit on 1/4\" (6.35mm) shaft, in my case that of a potentiometer.\r\nThe knob has a nice feel to it and should be usable for many projects. The bottom has been left almost entirely hollow, instead relying on a few ribs for strength. It prints in about 35min on a Makerbot.\r\n\r\nIf you want to print one for your stove, just scale it to 125% and adjust the bore, if 5/16\" (8mm) won't fit. \r\n\r\n  -Geert"
