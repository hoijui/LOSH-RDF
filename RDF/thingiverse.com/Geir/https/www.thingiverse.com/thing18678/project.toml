It also has a video.\r\nhttp://letsmakerobots.com/node/31381\r\n\r\nUPDATE: \r\nJust now I got some information on the 28BYJ-48 steppers that I used and can verify that this is a problem. So for anyone trying to build a sub-mm accuracy XY table, please try finding other stepper motors.\r\nThis is the information Iâ€™m talking about;\r\nhttp://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,71964.0.html"
