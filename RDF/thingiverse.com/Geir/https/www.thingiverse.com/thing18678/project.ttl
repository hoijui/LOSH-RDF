it might not be all that useful to anyone else but still I might as well put it up here if anyone is interested.\r
I added the sketchup model for any parts that I missed on the stl files so just use that to extract parts.\r
Iâ€™m not going in to a full assembly description but for more details you can have a look at this post over at LMR. It also has a video.\r

UPDATE: \r
Just now I got some information on the 28BYJ-48 steppers that I used and can verify that this is a problem. So for anyone trying to build a sub-mm accuracy XY table, please try finding other stepper motors.\r
This is the information Iâ€™m talking about;\r
