function: "I made this for my brother so he could have sensors or equipment navigate over a microwell plate http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtiter_plate \r\nit might not be all that useful to anyone else but still I might as well put it up here if anyone is interested.\r\nI added the sketchup model for any parts that I missed on the stl files so just use that to extract parts.\r\nI\xE2\u20AC\u2122m not going in to a full assembly description but for more details you can have a look at this post over at LMR. It also has a video.\r\nhttp://letsmakerobots.com/node/31381\r\n\r\nUPDATE: \r\nJust now I got some information on the 28BYJ-48 steppers that I used and can verify that this is a problem. So for anyone trying to build a sub-mm accuracy XY table, please try finding other stepper motors.\r\nThis is the information I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m talking about;\r\nhttp://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,71964.0.html"
