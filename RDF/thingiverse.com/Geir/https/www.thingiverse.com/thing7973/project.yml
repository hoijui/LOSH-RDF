function: "This device is probably not all that useable for anyone but me, but put it up here for inspiration.\r\nI have this autonomous boat that is used for mapping the seafloor and as I recently bought a waterproof video camera and I thought it might be cool to have it mounted on the boat. The bracket is tilt able so I can have the camera mounted at any angle for straight ahead to straight down.\r\nHere is a link to my project http://letsmakerobots.com/node/21098"
