function: "This is probably something that you SCAD guys (and girls) should have a go at as this would be great as a parametric model. \r\n\r\nMy SketchUp model is for the Flightmax 1000 LiPo battery but could probably be scaled to your needs. The walls are only 1mm thick but has enough strength to keep your battery in place. I did not add any mounting holes so it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s up to you to change the model. Mine will probably be glued in place.\r\n\r\nOn a personal note I must add that the print quality is great after I changed the settings for \xE2\u20AC\u201C Extra Shells- to zero."
