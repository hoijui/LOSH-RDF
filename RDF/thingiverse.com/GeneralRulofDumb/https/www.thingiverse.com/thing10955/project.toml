function = "Spiral bevel gears (conical, helical), proof of concept\r\n\r\nLook at :\r\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_bevel_gear \r\nfor some theory.\r\nActually my naming of these files is wrong, the gears ar not hypoid !\r\nThis means that the rotational axes of these two gears do cross through one point in space.\r\n\r\nGcode generated with netfabb-Ultimaker edition, Martijn's build-style, 0.15mm layer height.\r\nPrinted on my (standard) Ultimaker, speed 250%, fan on (great machine !)\r\n\r\nNB: the teeth were decreased in size somewhat to account for the fact that Ultimaker/netfabb produces parts that are almost exactly 0.3mm too big in x- and y-direction (z-direction is fine). Simply scaling the parts up or down (too much) would render the teeth too small or too big, respectively.\r\n\r\nNB 2: due to the nature of the ProE module I used the default Csys got rotated by the same angle that the teeth are pivoted, 45Â°. Rotate the STL (back) by the same angle and you should be fine."
