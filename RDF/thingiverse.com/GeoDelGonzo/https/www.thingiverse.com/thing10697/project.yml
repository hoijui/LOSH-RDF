function: "Has some blockhead come along and broken your mother's doorbell by excessively pounding on it? That's what happened to my mom, not just once either...\r\nSo instead of spending money on buying another doorbell button that will just break again, I decided to make something stronger, better... not sure about the faster part, but you get the idea. Unfortunately no one had/has made one on Thingiverse, so I was forced to make one myself and now I'm sharing it, so in case any poor soul out there needs one... It's there.\r\n\r\nI suggest printing it with natural ABS to get the best results, my doorbell has a light behind the button and it still shines through the new one.\r\nIn fact, I can't even tell if there was a difference from before, it looks exactly the same.\r\n\r\nMission accomplished and my mother is happy."
