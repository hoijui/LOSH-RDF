function: "I really liked the original PSU Mount that I derived this from, but the upgraded design seemed a bit like a Volvo to me.\r\n\r\nSo I sucked it into Openscad and matched up the screw holes, adding in the barbell design I found on a different mount.\r\n\r\nThis PSU mount is stable and strong, but make sure the infill is relatively high for the thinner X configuration.\r\n\r\nHere's a video of the build:\r\n\r\nhttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F2RXcn7tK4k"
