I needed it to be able to adjust the height after I flipped my x-axis here:\r\n\r\n thingiverse.com/thing:40192 \r\n\r\nSee instructions below for a more detailed explanation.\r\n\r\nAnd please forgive the lousy print in the photos, I had some loose bolts on the print bed when I printed it.  Of course, it's such a  simple part that it doesn't affect the operation of the bolt."
