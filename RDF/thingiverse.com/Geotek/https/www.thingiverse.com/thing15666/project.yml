function: I replaced the power supply in my Thing-O-Matic with one that was a bit beefier.  The new power supply was one of the acrylic types that had the fan grill on the outside of the unit.  To install the power supply, the original metal grill had to go.  This new printed grill fits nicely into the cutout in the side of the ToM. Note that I also cut a hole in the bottom of the unit for the second power supply fan.
