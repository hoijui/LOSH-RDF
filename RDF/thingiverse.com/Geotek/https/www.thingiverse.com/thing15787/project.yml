function: My Grandkids are coming over to see the Thing-O-Matic.  My wife was concerned that the kids might want to touch the hot platform, so I made this sign.  I used flourescent green, because that's what I had.  The blue LED strips I installed really make the flourescent colors come alive. Flourescent red would even be better!
