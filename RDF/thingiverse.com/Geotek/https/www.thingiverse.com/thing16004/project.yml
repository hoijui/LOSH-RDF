function: "This handy hanger is easy to fasten to the back of plaques or picture frames.  The offset provides a space between the hanger and the back of the plaque for a nailhead.  The sawtooth pattern allows horizontal adjustment.  There is a small centerline that makes it easy to align the hanger with a centerline drawn on the picture frame or plaque.  The hanger can be mortised into a picture frame with a 1/4\" router bit.\r\nTwo versions of the STL is provided.  One just has a single hanger, the other has four to save time in printing."
