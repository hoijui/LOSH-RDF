function: "The Chronulator is a kit from SharedBrain.  It displays the time on two analog current meters.  I wanted to build the Chronulator to look like an old fashioned lab instrument.  To do this I replaced the original clear plastic meters covers with covers I made on my ToM.  The case was made from Red Oak.\r\nThe scale was modified to show hour and minute."
