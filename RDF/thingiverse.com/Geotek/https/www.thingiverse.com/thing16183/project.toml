function = "When woodworkers are setting up their machines, they are always having to measure height.  There are quite a few gizmos out there for doing this, but many are just to complex or bulky to use.  This is especially true when the woodworker is faced with adjusting and truing the bed rollers on a thickness planer.  This device will make them smile.\r\nIt can also be used to set the height of a saw blade or router bit in the router table.  If yoy have a woodworker friend, this would be an ideal gift.\r\nThe dial indicator is a standard 1â€x9d travel.  They usually about $10 on line.  An indicator with a flat foot works best for measuring rollers and pointy things (like saw teeth).\r\nThe feet of the device have rare-earth magnets embedded in pockets.  The pockets are designed for magnets measuring 0.5â€x9d in diameter and 0.125â€x9d thick.  The magnets are glued in place before the two halves are glued together."
