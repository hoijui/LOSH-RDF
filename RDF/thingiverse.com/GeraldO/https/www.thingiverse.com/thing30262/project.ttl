\r
It can be a real chore to keep them all aligned when removing and replacing the HBP and this will ensure that all of the washers are aligned during assembly and will not shift during operation. There is ~1mm of tolerance with the washers on my Replicator and a few millimeters of clearance when the springs are fully compressed.\r
\r
*NOTE* It seems that newer replicators are shipping without these washers under the springs making this system unnecessary. Awesome!""" ;
