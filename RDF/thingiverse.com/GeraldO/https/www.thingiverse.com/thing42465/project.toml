function = "I recently got my Super Nintendo (NTSC) up and running with all of my childhood games however, I noticed that I misplaced all but one of my dust covers: time to print some! :)\r\n\r\nThis is as close a reproduction as I can muster of a dust cover for an SNES catridge. This fits like a glove, not too loose and not too tight, just the the originals!\r\n\r\nESD Warning: I am not liable for any static discharge induced by printed surface rubbing against the cartridge. I haven't experienced this myself however, print this and use at your own risk! I am using PLA for my prints and cannot account for a charge build up using other materials or guarantee using PLA will be free of this potential problem.\r\n\r\nI have included a plate of 4 covers which will fit on the Replicator's build platform in addition to the single cover.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
