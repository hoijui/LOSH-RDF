function: "I'm using one of those Leather case with flip cover and was bored to change the cover for using in my car or night stand etc.\r\nSo I've made one for the IP5 with my usual cover. A very important point for me was to use it open and closed and of course charge it inside the mount.  It's meant to be used with one of this cheap sticky phone pads for car dashboard, but if you print it with 66% Infill, you can also drill a Hole through...\r\n\r\nTo use it, first slide the top side in like the angel of the little rampe and the lower the bottom inside the mount and behind the edges. No force needed. :-)"
