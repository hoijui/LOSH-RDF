\r
After recently using it to transport a cake for a New Year's party and treating it like a family heirloom ("RETURN THE HOLDER INTACT!") I returned it intact. Pfew! Disowning avoided! :)\r
\r
A few moments after cleaning it somehow mom dropped it by accident and one of the clips shattered. Mom was devastated but I said "No problem! I'll make a new one".\r
\r
Scanned an intact clip with a flatbed scanner, measured it with calipers on all sides, created the model in Sketchup and the printed it. Turned out almost perfect. Mom is very happy I fixed her cake transporter. Mission accomplished!\r
\r
If I did not have a 3D printer this minor accident would have been a disaster rendering the whole thing useless. I don't know where I would have found another satisfactory cake holder. Just goes to show the social changes 3D printing will bring. This moment should be marked in history as "3D printing made Mom happy"\r
\r
The yellow one in the photo is one of the 3 originals still intact for refference.""" ;
