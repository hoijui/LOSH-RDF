function: "This is a conceptual design illustrating an idea I had to create a drop in replacement large gear for existing wade extruder. The teeth are internal to make the overall area taken up by the driven gear and the pinion gear as small as possible.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think the teeth are quite right, and I don't think this will fit on a wade extruder using any of the existing chassis mounts.\r\n\r\nI am hoping someone else might take this idea forward if there is any way the issues can be solved."
