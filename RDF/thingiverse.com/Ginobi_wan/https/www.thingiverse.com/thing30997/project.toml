function = "This was a project to organize some study notecards.  Unfortunately the project sort of got away from me and did not end up what I wanted.  I wanted to upload everything anyway.  Essentially there is a model of a Notecard (Picture) box with lid, and a couple different dividers.  There are also a few versions of locks that hold one version of the dividers together.  \r\n\r\nI purchased a $3 box from Walmart that I think was for pictures (I knowâ€¦still need to get the laser cutter so I could just make the box too :) ).  I wanted to design and make dividers for the box so we could organize the notecards.  Unfortunately my UP! printer does not have that big of a work envelope so I had to go another route.\r\n\r\nI created the parts in AutoDesk Inventor, so I posted the .ipt & iam files along with the .stl files.  For simplicity I uploaded the files in two separate .zip files.\r\n\r\n+ STL files loaded in â€œNote Card Box and Dividers STLs.zipâ€x9d file\r\n+ Inventor files loaded in â€œNote Card Box and Dividers Inventor Files.zipâ€x9d file\r\n\r\n\r\n- Box & Box Lid: â€œNote Card Box.stlâ€x9d & â€œNote Card Box Top.stlâ€x9d\r\n- Original Simple Divider (Quick Design): â€œDivider1 test.stlâ€x9d\r\n- Split Dividers (to fit my printer): â€œDivider Small-Left.stlâ€x9d & â€œDivider Small-Right_MIR.stlâ€x9d\r\n- Divider Locks & Supports (just trying different things to support the notecards): â€œDivider Lock - Standoff .stlâ€x9d & â€œDivider Lock 1.stlâ€x9d â€œDivider Lock 2.stlâ€x9d"
