    okh:function """This was a project to organize some study notecards.  Unfortunately the project sort of got away from me and did not end up what I wanted.  I wanted to upload everything anyway.  Essentially there is a model of a Notecard (Picture) box with lid, and a couple different dividers.  There are also a few versions of locks that hold one version of the dividers together.  \r
\r
I purchased a $3 box from Walmart that I think was for pictures (I knowâ€¦still need to get the laser cutter so I could just make the box too :) ).  I wanted to design and make dividers for the box so we could organize the notecards.  Unfortunately my UP! printer does not have that big of a work envelope so I had to go another route.\r
\r
I created the parts in AutoDesk Inventor, so I posted the .ipt & iam files along with the .stl files.  For simplicity I uploaded the files in two separate .zip files.\r

+ STL files loaded in â€œNote Card Box and Dividers STLs.zipâ€x9d file\r
