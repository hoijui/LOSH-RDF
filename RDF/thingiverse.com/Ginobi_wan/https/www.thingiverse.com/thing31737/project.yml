function: "This is a replacement Golf Ball Marker that snaps onto your golf glove.  I lost my marker and thought I might try to print one.  Attached are two different designs; one with a smiley face :) and one plain one.  I also included the original Inventor file.\r\n\r\nI quickly designed the button snap feature and it was a tight fit after coming off the printer.  I just slightly filed it to the point where it was not too tight but tight enough not to fall off.\r\n\r\nI created the parts in AutoDesk Inventor, so I posted the .ipt file along with the two .stl files.\r\n\r\n+ STL file with Smiley Face: Golf Marker Button-Smile Vers.stl\r\n+ STL file with flat plain surface: Golf Marker Button-Blank Vers.stl\r\n+ Inventor file: Golf Marker Button-Smile Vers.ipt\r\n\r\n**Caution Notice: This golf device will not improve your golf game in any way ;)"
