function = "This is a replacement adjustable foot for living room furniture.  The feet go to a coffee table and end tables.  During one of our many home moves we lost one of the adjustable feet.  I went ahead and copied the foot and printed it out.\r\n\r\nI created the part in AutoDesk Inventor, so I posted the .ipt and .stl files.  Note that I created the threads in Inventor using the â€œThread Modelerâ€x9d add in.  It was my first time using the plug in and it worked great.  You can get it at http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/thread_modeler/\r\n\r\n\r\nFiles:\r\n+ STL file without threads: Coffee Table Foot without thread.stl\r\n+ STL file with threads: Coffee Table Foot with thread.stl\r\n+ Inventor file: Coffee Table Foot.ipt"
