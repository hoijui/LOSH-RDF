    okh:function """This is a replacement adjustable foot for living room furniture.  The feet go to a coffee table and end tables.  During one of our many home moves we lost one of the adjustable feet.  I went ahead and copied the foot and printed it out.\r
\r
I created the part in AutoDesk Inventor, so I posted the .ipt and .stl files.  Note that I created the threads in Inventor using the â€œThread Modelerâ€ add in.  It was my first time using the plug in and it worked great.  You can get it at http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/thread_modeler/\r
