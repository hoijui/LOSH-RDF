function = "Winder for Christmas Lights: Unfortunately I do not have a laser cutting machine but liked the winder design by Schenkzoola.  So I went ahead made a derivative of the laser design.  I imported Schenkzoolaâ€™s design into AutoDesk Inventor and gave it some thickness and some support ribs.  I also had to scale the print to get it to fit on my UP! printer but uploaded the basic model with thickness.  Reference: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39784\r\n\r\n\r\nI have posted the .ipt files along with the .stl files.\r\n+ STL file for Schenkzoola with thickness: Christmas Light Winder_FullScale.stl\r\n+ IPT file for Schenkzoola with thickness: Christmas Light Winder_FullScale.ipt\r\n+ STL file for scaled down design: Christmas Light Winder_Scaled.stl\r\n+ IPT file for scaled down design: Christmas Light Winder_Scaled.ipt"
