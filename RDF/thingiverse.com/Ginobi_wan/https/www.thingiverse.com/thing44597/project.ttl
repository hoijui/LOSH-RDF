    okh:function """Winder for Christmas Lights: Unfortunately I do not have a laser cutting machine but liked the winder design by Schenkzoola.  So I went ahead made a derivative of the laser design.  I imported Schenkzoolaâ€™s design into AutoDesk Inventor and gave it some thickness and some support ribs.  I also had to scale the print to get it to fit on my UP! printer but uploaded the basic model with thickness.  Reference: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39784\r
\r

I have posted the .ipt files along with the .stl files.\r
