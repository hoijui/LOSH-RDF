function = "I made this simple but effective stand because I couldn't find one on Thingiverse that supports tablets at more than one angle. This stand will hold an ipad or other tablet with or without a case (up to 1/3 inch thick), in the vertical or horizontal position at either ~38 or ~68  degrees from the horizontal. \r\n\r\nIf someone has any tips or suggestion to improve this design please let me know..."
