function: "An exact change holder. This thing carries 3 quarters, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies. Using this amount of change, you can produce any amount of money under and including a dollar. Say goodbye to getting change back when paying cash for things!\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of the original exact change holder on thingiverse. I've added deeper penny wells because they were way too shallow and added rounded corners for easier manipulation in wallets. The only potential problem with this still is that the wells are all a little too wide. I prefer this as it is easy to get change out, but it is not a snug fit."
