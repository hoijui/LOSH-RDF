Including the base approx 49cm tall. The inner ring should hopefully rotate and there are small spaces behind the chevrons for leds, maybe small ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf someone puts a stepper motor on this and links it up to a control unit (pc or arduino) you could have a gate which actually dials.\r\n\r\nNote: This item is intended for personal use only. \r\n\r\nEdit June 2016. Since the Mk1 and Mk2 Stargates are slightly different sizes. If you like the SGC style ramp for the Mk2 Stargate, you can use the SGC Ramp for Working Stargate Mk1 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1603663"
