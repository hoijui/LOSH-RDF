function = "The Gridded Globe is an advanced print for any 3D printer.  If you were planning on printing the gridded globe without full support material, then you'll know those floating islands wouldn't stand a chance.  This derivative removes the floating islands to reduce the amount of unsupported and unbridged extruded filament that could cause problems in other areas of the print.  There are still extreme overhangs that will leave filament hanging.  Good luck, and happy printing from Glitch 3D Models in Vancouver BC."
