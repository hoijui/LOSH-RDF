function: Jim Raynor! In marine form! Anyone who's played the Starcraft I/II campaign knows him! And for those who haven't, he is the main character of Starcraft and Starcraft 2. I got this model by importing raynor.m3 (gotten from the Starcraft II Map Editor) with Blender and exporting (this requires a plugin).
