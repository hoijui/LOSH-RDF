function: "I needed a tray for a bunch of SMD parts.  My first venture into the world of SMD, so I figured any tools that can make it in easier transition would be a good thing...\r\n\r\nThis is one of those helpful things.\r\n\r\nI made it 12 compartments, each 20mm x 20mm.  I also angled the top, thinking that it might help in seeing/grabbing the small parts living in the compartments.\r\n\r\nI am printing it as I type this...\r\n\r\nI hope it helps you guys/gals.  (and myself as well ;-)"
