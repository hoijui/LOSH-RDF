function = "I printed the filament drive found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7113, but I found myself lacking an M6 bolt + nut.  \r\n\r\nBecause the bearing just needs to be held in there, but not tightened down, I decided to design a pin to do the job.  This pin is 19mm long, with 3mm of base, and 3mm for the flange at the end.  The base will sit ~1mm from the back of the filament drive when it is engaged, so the pin is incapable of coming out while in use."
