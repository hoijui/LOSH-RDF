function = "This is the final version of my X & Y tensioner.  It is now a universal one usable on both Axis.  It is slipped over the 4 bolts attaching the motor and utilizes the existing tension slots.  \r\n\r\nYou will need to drill one hole for each tensioner.  The Y uses a 20mm 3M Bolt and the X uses a 16mm one.  The X can be a tight fit for thickness, so I suggest you try your first one on the X, if it's too thick you can still use it on the Y.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for something that is more securely fastened down or you have issues with warping/pulling off the bolts, there are 2 other options that should fit the bill.\r\n\r\nThe first alternative uses countersunk bolts and was created by Tunell: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11775/\r\n\r\nThe second is the derivative of this one by M_G that adds a layer of plastic under bolt: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14098"
