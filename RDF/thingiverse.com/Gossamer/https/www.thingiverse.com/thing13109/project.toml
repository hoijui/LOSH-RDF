function = "None of the Tardises on here were quite what I was looking for, so i decided to make one myself.  \r\n\r\nI tried to make it as parametric as possible, but you'll still find some things, such as the depth of the face impression, that are static.    \r\n\r\nI'm working on an accompanying insert that will light up the light on top from the inside, I'll add that as a derivative as it develops.  \r\n\r\nLet me know if you find any parameters that aren't scaling/re-sizing properly.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  Per suggestions from Bluemetal and Tbuser I've added leading 0s to my decimal values and added render() to the face module, so it will now compile(F5) properly."
