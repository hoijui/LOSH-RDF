Update 10/8/13:- Sorry this took so long, fredzemail74 made his own redirect vent that I actually like better (thanks, fred): http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:107080  \r
The difference in airflow is noticeable, though I haven't printed as much since that replacement. Research on whether or not my thing is detrimental to the fan long-term has not been done. Y'all should try both and see which you like.  \r

My larger prints were lifting from the platform because the fan from the stepstruder was blowing cool air off the metal frame and onto the build platform, cooling the PLA more than needed. This vent forces the exhaust upwards and minimizes that effect. At 5mm it's the same thickness as the existing chrome grill and a replacement for it. The .stl and .sldprt has a blank face but I added a P for style pointz.""" ;
