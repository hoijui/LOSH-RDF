    okh:function """The slider on our cupboard door broke, and made the door hard to open/close. Since the said slider was made about 50 years ago, it hasn't done too badly, however, due to its age, it is no longer available. While we are going to renovate in the next year, that is a little to long to wait. In steps the REPRAP I built with the kids (I built... they said "when's it going to be ready... can we print X with it?"). Half an hour with FreeCAD, and a check on NetFabb, and I was printing a replacement. A little cleaning up (I'm still tuning the printer, but it is much better now than it was when I printed this), and we fitted it. Worked perfectly the first time!\r
\r
Not that I expect anybody else to be able to use this thing, but it is yet another case of REPRAP to the rescue, and yet another "wife acceptance point" in its favour.""" ;
