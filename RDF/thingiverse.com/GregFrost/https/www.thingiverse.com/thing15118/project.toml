function = "This carriage has some differences from my other lm8uu carriage:\r\n\r\n1. It is designed to work with nophead's half-belt hack: where the belt is either twisted or cut and joined such that the smooth side of the belt goes over the idler bearing (the teeth grippers on the belt clamps are on the other side).\r\n\r\n2. It has a square(ish) hole so that it can accept my hotends that use 30mm aluminium tslot as a heat sink: http://i1236.photobucket.com/albums/ff455/gregfrost1/IMGP1349.jpg\r\n\r\n3. The belt clamps are designed to use a single screw instead of 2.\r\n\r\n4. It is slightly narrower than the previous version (to maximise x travel and get the fan a bit closer to the hotend heatsink).\r\n\r\n5. Thanks to Triffid Hunter I have included a ram to protect the belt from the tensioning screw.\r\n\r\n6. The double bearing is now on the side of the belt where it belongs (Less binding if binding is even possible with linear bearings).\r\n\r\nPhoto to follow (currently printing)."
