function = "Some minor changes to my filament pusher inspired by Tom's update (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16928).\r\nI have incorporated a filament guide on the idler (and coined the term guidler).\r\nI also took his modification so the front bearing doesnt rub and I have included a printed spacer so the bottom bearing doesnt rub either (just insert it before the bearing).\r\nI also widened the opening a bit for better access to the hobbing (another of Tom's ideas).\r\nI also included one of Triffid Hunter's suggestions to modify the hinge support piece slightly to make it easier to remove.\r\n\r\nThanks Tom and Triffid for the ideas."
