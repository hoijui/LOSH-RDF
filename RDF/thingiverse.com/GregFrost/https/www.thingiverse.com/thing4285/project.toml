function = "A mountable box for the techzone USB-TTL board.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the techzone boards come with mounting holes, but the USB-TTL board doesn't. It is also the most likely board to be yanked when someone accidentally trips on or tugs the USB cable. This box allows you to mount the board to your machine with a bit more mechanical soundness."
