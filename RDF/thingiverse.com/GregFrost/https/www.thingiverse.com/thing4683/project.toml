function = "A kinetic sculpture made using my parametric bevel gear script inspired by this: http://www.brainblog.to/item/2008/11/herz-aus-zahnraedern  \r\nI modeled the entire thing from scratch in OpenSCAD, starting with the Parametric Involute Bevel and Spur Gear script I posted some time ago. I have added an additional complexity to the movement because not only do the gears spin, but the axes of the gears rotate too.\r\n\r\nBeing a kinetic sculpture, you really need to see it in motion:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx28cHA4_KI\r\n\r\nBe warned that before you attempt to print this, an improved technique for attaching the gears to the central mount is really needed.\r\n\r\nI have the openscad files for everything, although there are so many parts that it is a bit of a process generating the STLs from them.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to collaborate on a better way to mount the gears, let me know."
