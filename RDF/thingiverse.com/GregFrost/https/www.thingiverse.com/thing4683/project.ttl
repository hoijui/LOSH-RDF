    okh:function """A kinetic sculpture made using my parametric bevel gear script inspired by this: http://www.brainblog.to/item/2008/11/herz-aus-zahnraedern  \r
I modeled the entire thing from scratch in OpenSCAD, starting with the Parametric Involute Bevel and Spur Gear script I posted some time ago. I have added an additional complexity to the movement because not only do the gears spin, but the axes of the gears rotate too.\r
\r
Being a kinetic sculpture, you really need to see it in motion:\r

\r
Be warned that before you attempt to print this, an improved technique for attaching the gears to the central mount is really needed.\r
\r
I have the openscad files for everything, although there are so many parts that it is a bit of a process generating the STLs from them.\r
\r
If someone wants to collaborate on a better way to mount the gears, let me know.""" ;
