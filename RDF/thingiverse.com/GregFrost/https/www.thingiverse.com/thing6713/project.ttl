    okh:function """Nothing to see here. You really want version 3: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8252 (although this is still a good reference for the benefits of the accessible aspects.\r
\r
**Version 2 now uploaded**. Generate STLs from the version 2 scad to get the version 2 changes. NOTE: To do this you must have configuration.scad from the prusa git repo in the same directory as gregs-wade-v2.scad so that bolt and nut sizes defined in that file can be used.\r
\r
This is an extruder based strongly on the wades from the Prusa git repo. It has several features over the standard wade:\r
\r
1. Accessible hobbing. If you strip the filament, there is no need to disassemble in any way (such as removing the idler/filament or bolt) in order to remove the stripped plastic from the hobbing. You can get a needle in the hole in the top and scrape it out.\r
\r
2. The motor can be removed without removing the large gear. The three mounting screws can be accessed without removing the gear. 2 of them are clearly accessible and the other is accessible through a hole in the gear.\r
\r
3. Slightly higher gear ratio than standard wade. This design uses 43:10 instead of 37:11.\r
\r
4. The rotated motor mount means that the carriage attachment screw is accessible with the motor installed.\r
\r
5. The rotated motor mount also means that the clearance past the idler attachment captive nuts is a bit longer, so you have a bit more play tensioning the idler.\r
\r
6. The motor is far enough back from the face that the small gear can be mounted with the hub towards the motor (necessary with short shafted motors) and it will mesh with the large gear when there is only 1 washer between the bearing and the large gear.\r
\r
7. The large gear has a shallow nut trap so that locking halfnuts can be used with hobbed threaded rod (infinitely adjustable hob alignment) rather than a bolt.\r
\r
8. The motor mount screws are recessed allowing the large gear to be almost against the face of the extruder body.\r
\r
9. It has sexy curves.\r
\r
Things I still plan to do:\r
Add some options to the way the small gear mounts on the shaft. I have always had problems getting that right (hence http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5213).\r
\r
Version 2 Changes:\r
* Added the 4th idler screw hole. \r
* Moved the top captive nuts for the idler screws closer to the idler so that you can screw the idler bolts in further\r
* Made the motor mount slots go a further 1mm away from the hobbed bolt (as requested by spacexula)\r
* Added the framework for hotend mount supports (I still need people to tell me what their particular hotend mounting needs are). Each hotend defines its holes assuming that the extruder block is sitting vertical with the filament exit hole at [0,0,0]).""" ;
