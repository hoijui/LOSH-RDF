function: "If you're looking at this, you probably really want this version that has better access for cleaning the hobb and also a guide for the filament integrated with the idler:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17030\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the stages of development, read on for the details of this version:\r\n\r\nThis is an update to my Accessible Wade's Extruder.\r\n\r\nThe idler is now hinged using an M3 screw.\r\nI have also added support for the central part of the 608 idler so that there is no need to use washers to space the bearing away from the plastic.\r\n\r\nI have been using this design for a while now and love it.\r\n\r\nChanging filament is a simple as compressing the spring then whipping out the old filament and poking the new one in.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 6 Aug 2011 - Add arcol (cory75 thing:10532) and wildseyed hotend mount options. Im not overly happy with the asymmetry of the arcol option."
