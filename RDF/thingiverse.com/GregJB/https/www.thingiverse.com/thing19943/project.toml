function = "This is a camera mount for a Foscam FI810W Wired/Wirless PT camera. I made it to mount to the slotted angle iron from which my garage door opener is attached. It allows the camera to be mounted below and away from the opener motor without interfering with maintenance on the opener should it be required.\r\n\r\nI used 1/4\" clear cell cast acrylic; it looks like the camera is levitating because you can't see the mount very well. Use acrylic color and type of your choosing; adjusting power settings as per your laser reccommendations.\r\n\r\nIt also allows the camera to be mounted low enough to enable vision outside when the garage door is raised.\r\n\r\nI hope this simple design is helpful. It will save someone somewhere some time and works well with this sub $100.00 PT IP Camera."
