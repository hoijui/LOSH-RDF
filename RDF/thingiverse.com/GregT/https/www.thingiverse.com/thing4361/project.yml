function: "This is a derivation of twotimes\\' excellent wobbler arrester. There are several changes. First, a new z-guide replaces the clamp. It performs the duty of connecting the smooth stabilizing rods showcased in twotimes\\' approach to the acrylic stand. This z-guide bolts through the top of the acrylic stand using the holes also used by the z-floats. As with twotimes\\' approach, the z-floats connect the acrylic stand to the threaded z-rods. The z-guide and the z-float sandwich the acrylic stand.\r\n\r\nSecond, the z-float has been modified. A fifth bolt hole has been added to it, allowing it to be bolted to the z-guide. This provides extra support to the cantilevered z-guide.\r\n\r\nThird, the z-guide has a spring built into it. This forgives any expansion in the acrylic stand due to heat from the heated build platform, as well as imperfections in the alignment of the smooth stabilizing z-rods. At the same time, it\\'s sufficiently stiff that almost all wobbling will be eaten up by the more flexible springs in the z-floats.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, this is mostly theory. I have not finished setting this up on my bot and have no plans to do so. As the new Thing-O-Matic shows, the future of the z-rods is in larger Acme threaded rods, eliminating the bendy threaded rods that many of us currently are saddled with. After seeing the Thing-O-Matic, I decided to upgrade to the Acme threaded rod kit that has been appearing periodically on eBay. Still, the wobbler hobbler is a relatively inexpensive hack and some of you may be interested in it. I tried to put this into production, but I\\'ve had a few issues lately with broken insulators, broken pinch wheels, intrusions from the real world, etc., and have decided to simply post this and see if anyone wants to take it over the finish line."
