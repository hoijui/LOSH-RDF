function: "This is the first unique thing I created on my Makerbot, using Blender. For years, I've had a missing battery cover on my TV remote. I thought it would be a pretty simple thing to design and I was right. It took a few trial-and-error attempts to get the dimensions just right. I also had to use a Dremel to whittle the latch and make it fit properly. The bottom line is that I now have a battery cover that clicks snugly into place. I couldn't be happier with how it turned out.\r\n\r\nHere is a vid: www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz6pTHOxRv0"
