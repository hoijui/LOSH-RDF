function = "Edit 2: New version now with text! http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11629\r\n(It's a new thing because I needed to use a different license)\r\n\r\nA parametric ring with a triangular \"gem\". Ment to be printed with 2 materials.\r\nAfter seeing news about makerbot's dual extrusion I decided to design something utilizing it. (even if I can't print it yet T_T )\r\n\r\nEdit: Made this kid friendly by adding an optional safety gap so it does not need to be cut off if it gets stuck.\r\nEdit 3: Made the gem's number of sides customizable, and gave it rotation."
