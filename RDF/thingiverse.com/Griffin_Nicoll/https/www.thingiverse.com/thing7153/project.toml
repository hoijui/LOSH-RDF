function = "After repeated failures of the standard z-axis rod coupling, a need for a more robust coupler was determined. This coupler has separate clamps for the 3/16th drive rod and the motor shaft, centering both without stretching the PLA too much. Additionally, it has recesses for the nuts, allowing very easy tightening and adjustments. This design however uses 4 bolts and nuts instead of 2."
