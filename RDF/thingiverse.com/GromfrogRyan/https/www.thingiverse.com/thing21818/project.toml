function = "This is my first Raspberry Pi Case. You place your Model B Board in the bottom half of the case which has plenty of ventilation. Then attach the top part of the case by placing over the top and letting the clips on each side click. The top plate also has plenty of ventilation to make sure your Pi does not over cook. I will be adapting this over time and making it much better. If you have any suggestions please do leave a comment below."
