function = "Build your own replica of the famous Taipei 101. Once Taipei 101 was the worlds tallest building and the design is fantastic.\r\nModel Volume: 384.87cm3\r\nModel Height (built): 60.53cm (approx)\r\nHow much material will it use? 230g (This is a rough calculation based on weight per cm3)\r\nIf the item was completly solid it would take around 2.5 kg so I hollowed out the item to reduce the amount of plastic.\r\n\r\nI would love some feedback on my model and some possible improvements. Thanks. Ryan"
