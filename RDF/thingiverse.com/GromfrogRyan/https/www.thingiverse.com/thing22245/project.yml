function: "Can you solve the Cube? With 12 parts this cube is quite tricky to complete but once you have done it you will be able to do it again.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded the all the puzzle pieces in one file and for people who have limited room on their printers I have also sliced up the file for you.\r\n\r\nIf you solve the puzzle please post a pic in the comment section and I will add you to the list below of people who have solved it.\r\nHave fun!"
