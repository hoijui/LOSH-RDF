function = "I have designed many cases in the past 6 months for the Raspberry Pi and have only uploaded on of them to Thingiverse. But I have been working on a new case for a week now. It is not like any other case I can find on Thingiverse and the internet and is totally unique.\r\nI present to you The Pi. The first case in the shape of the Raspberry Pi logo.\r\n\r\nYou have access to all the ports including the GPIO.\r\n\r\nMore info will be posted on the design process and tips for printing on http://Gromfrog.com soon."
