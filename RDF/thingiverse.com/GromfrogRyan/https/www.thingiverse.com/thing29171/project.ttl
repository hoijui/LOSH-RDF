    okh:function """High detailed model of car's brake disc. Using reference models and 2D drawings of a basic brake disk  I created this model.\r
I have scaled all of the parts to be a nice fit on a replicator build platform. I recommend printing with a 40% infill and using support material and raft.\r
\r
[UPDATE: 27th August 2012 19:08 GMT] WOOO i have finally got round to uploading the files to shapeways so you can now buy them. Here are the links to all of the parts that you will need to order. I am also going to reduce the size down so it is cheaper, more on that soon. \r
