function: "Our medieval chain mail that we posted here a few days ago is printable but is very fine and the printer will require alot of calibration. But now we have finally made a bigger hooped version that should be easier to print on printers that would struggle with our other version.\r\n\r\n[Update :: 2nd October 2012 :: 12:32 GMT] We are currently thinking of new ideas that we can use this chain mail in to make some great products."
