The item can also be used as bling to show that you don't have to work for a living; since it is impossible to type while wearing the device and since typing is central to most work now, this bling shows the wearer is independently wealthy. It's like what a suntan or any number of historical fashions were used to show. Print yours now and be in the vanguard!\r
\r
Can also be used as a holder for 15.7 mm diameter vials.""" ;
