function: "This object is like a spam blocker, but intended for inappropriate gestural communications.\r\n\r\nThe item can also be used as bling to show that you don't have to work for a living; since it is impossible to type while wearing the device and since typing is central to most work now, this bling shows the wearer is independently wealthy. It's like what a suntan or any number of historical fashions were used to show. Print yours now and be in the vanguard!\r\n\r\nCan also be used as a holder for 15.7 mm diameter vials."
