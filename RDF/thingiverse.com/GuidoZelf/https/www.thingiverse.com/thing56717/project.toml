function = "I based this off of Fastrack's spool centre feeder, adjusted it to fit a Rep2 better. Lowered it and also the wiringloom stays much closer to the machine with this design, so the metal clips can better hold it in place.\r\nHas nice smooth round guides with clips that allow the filament to be \"clipped in\" making removing/changing filament spools easy."
