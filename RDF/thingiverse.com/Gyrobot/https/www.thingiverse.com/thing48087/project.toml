function = "Based upon the famous walking Strandbeest from Theo Jansen ( http://www.strandbeest.com ). This is a modular clip together system that is FDM printer friendly. No support required.  \r\nI have curved the links in an organic way such that the shape of the leg section looks ahem \"bra\" like, hence the name.  \r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble with the cranks, try this re-mixed version from Vivifyer:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:207351   \r\n\r\nEDIT 07/09/2015 : Added a step file of the assembly so you can import into the CAD package of your choice.  \r\n   \r\nSee videos :  \r\nhttp://youtu.be/PdvfL4GfMk0  \r\nhttp://youtu.be/vUjEQ_0bEqg  \r\nhttp://www.gyrobot.co.uk  \r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/gyrobotuk"
