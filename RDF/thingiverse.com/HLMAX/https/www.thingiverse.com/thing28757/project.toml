function = "Another spool holder! \r\n\r\nThis is a spool holder that clips onto the top of a Prusa. Desiged for compact, 90mm wide, 2kg spools. \r\nClips on easily and easy to remove. The filament is dispensed inline with the X axis, so it comes off the spool easier with less flexing and rattling."
