function = "The T MAX is a derivative of the MendelMax.\r\nIt main features:\r\n- Taller print height by placing the side columns vertical, and widen the space between the the top horizontal beams to allow the extruder assemble to protruded pass the beams. \r\n- With the side columns vertical and closer toward the center of the printer, one has better accessibility to the print bed and extruder.\r\n- More height under the bed to accommodate the mounting of power supply, controller, and  control panels.  \r\n\r\nThe T MAX uses all the same major components as the MendelMax. If you have a MendelMax, it can be easily converted to a T MAX; or assemble a T MAX from a MendelMax extrusion and hardware kit.  \r\nThe T MAX is design to use low maintenance Igus pillow block bearings, a RAMPS 1.4 controller, and a common eBay 12VDC, 30A power supply.  \r\n\r\nMaximum print size is approximately X 210mm, Y 210mm and Z 210mm.  \r\n\r\nT MAX LCD & SD Control Panel: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29903  \r\nT MAX Spool Holder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29883"
