function = "For years I emptied my pockets of change into a 5 gallon jug, and collected about 65 pounds worth of coins. I didn't want to pay the 10% fee to the supermarket coin counters, but the mechanical  sorter/counters I found on the web got terrible reviews on their functioning and durability. Sorting trays are available on the web, for about $10 plus shipping, as are counter/roller tubes, for about $18 plus shipping, but they were also frequently reviewed as unreliable.  \r\nThe sorting tray set and counter/rollers here work quickly and reliably."
