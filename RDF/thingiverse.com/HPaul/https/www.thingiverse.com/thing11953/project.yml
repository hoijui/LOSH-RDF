function: "UPDATE:  \r\n\r\nElvis has been improved! Check out \"Elvis Skull Resurrected\" at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:158022  \r\n\r\nThanks to \"Cleaned Hollow Skull by ssd\" for the mesh of the skull and mandible. I've cleaned up the interior a bit, attached the mandible, and added support and teeth. If anyone can further clean this up, please do.  \r\n\r\n Printable(?) because there are hanging filaments and a great deal of excess plastic on the inside that I haven't been able to lose. The drooping threads vary in quantity and placement depending on the scale. On the upside, the droops are all on the undersides or inside of the print, are easily cleaned up with an X-acto & sandpaper, and don't affect the final appearance."
