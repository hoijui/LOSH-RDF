function = "This is a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13671 which was designed to fit the fatter connector. This Cable Spooler fits the thinner, smaller connector.  \r\n\r\nAlso, moving the connector pocket to the end of the adapter makes it more compact.  \r\n\r\nIf you can't make the cable end up as shown, try turning the Spooler on the adapter; there are a number of ways to mount it."
