function = "This is an easy part to print and is designed to waste little material.\r\n\r\nUse for mounting microphones, hard drives, mixers, spare batteries and anything else with a 1/4-20 thread mount.  Attaches to standard 15mm camera support rods.\r\n\r\nThese parts use 1/4-20 UNC nuts on a plastic base so you can print it instead of machining one out of metal.\r\nMany of the parts I make available here can be seen in action on professional gear at http://www.habbycam.com\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave your feedback on Thinkiverse."
