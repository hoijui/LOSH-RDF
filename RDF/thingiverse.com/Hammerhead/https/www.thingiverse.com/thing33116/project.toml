function = "Modified mount clips for Ikea Dioder lighting to enable strips to be affixed internally in the Replicator frame.\r\n\r\nThis model is based on a combination of designs from txoof (Thing 98691) and hullo3d (Thing 32373).  I wanted the LED strips to be INTERNAL to the Replicator frame, and light the build platform from both top and front, maximizing the output from the strips, protecting them from accidental damage, reducing glare, and maintaining the aesthetic of the machine.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, this method does not interfere with any method of enclosing the build platform with plexi so that you can still use any clips or mounts on the top, front and sides of the machine."
