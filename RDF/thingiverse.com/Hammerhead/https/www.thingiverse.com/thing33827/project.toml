function = "A more elegant back panel for your Replicator, derived from the original MBI part files.  I designed this in a fit of OCD, having smudged the screen printed ink on the original plywood riser.  There are two versions of the riser plate - one for decorative use, and a second file with screw/nut relief for those of you who wish to use this model to replace (rather than just cover) their rear riser panel."
