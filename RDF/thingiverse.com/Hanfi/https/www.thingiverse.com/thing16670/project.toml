function = "This is a holder for the PlayStation 3 Move controller. If you want to play a shooter like game with Move this will give you a comfortable solution on holding the controller horizontally (requirement by most games). Easy clip-in system, no need for elastic straps!\r\n\r\nThis is WORK IN PROGRESS future updates WILL come, including better ergonomics and buttons for reload (cant promise). The controller is USABLE in its current state, visible in the picture.\r\n\r\nEdit: Since I no longer have a makerbot, no further development done on this. I once planned to make a reload trigger. I will try to upload the files if I still find them\r\n\r\nWrite into comments if your interested in the 3D Max files!"
