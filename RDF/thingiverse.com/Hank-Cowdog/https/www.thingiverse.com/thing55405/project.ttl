    okh:function """This printrbot print bed platform and base starts with Beardface's printrbot bed ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17717 ) and incorporates a three point leveling system using the leveling knob idea from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9094 (reimplemented as an OpenSCAD file), but using a 3-point leveling approach.  The bed platform and base are designed to be cut out of 1/4" MDF using a laser CNC printer.  The spinner knobs can be 3D printed from ABS or PLA.\r
\r
Caveats:\r
 - Since the leveling system uses two layers of MDF with at least 1/4" spacing in between (for the two nuts and a little space for leveling) this system will reduce your printable Z-height by about 1/2" or a little more.\r
\r
 - The holes for attaching the print bed to the bed platform are spaced for clipping an 8"X8" bed to the base from the outside.  If your heated bed attaches via holes in the corner, the 4 holes for attaching it may need to be adjusted.  The SVG file included can be edited using InkScape ( http://www.inkscape.org ).""" ;
