function = "This is a device used for testing middle school students' structures. It is an improvement on putting a structure across two sawhorses and hanging weights from the structure!\r\n\r\nI've used it for \"Jinx Wood\" bridge structures as well as sheet metal structures. \r\n\r\nCheck out my TeacherHann YouTube Channel - www.youtube.com/teacherhann - for videos of my students projects being tested to destruction!\r\n\r\nKudos to my colleague, fellow middle school Design and Technology teacher Gord McGill for allowing me to replicate his idea!"
