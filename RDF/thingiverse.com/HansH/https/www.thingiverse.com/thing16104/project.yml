function: "The Raspberry  Pi is a creditcard sized computer which you can buy for $25 or $35 (depending which version)\r\n\r\nNever designed a case before, so perhaps things can be better...\r\n\r\n......\r\n\r\nv11 Different splitlevel (more simple) on backside\r\n     keep a little margin on back split, so that top and bottom always fit\r\n     added openlogo option\r\n     added pcbholder option\r\n     changed support studs a bit\r\n     changed dimensions to 85.0 x 56.20\r\n\r\nv12 Different component locations/sizes\r\n     keep a little margin on component holes\r\n     pcbsize to 57.0 x 86.0   (actual it is 56.17 x 85.0)\r\n     made casestuds wider and added 2 minor holes for self tapping screws\r\n\r\nv14 Got a RPI.. so production board measurements...\r\n\r\nv15 moved the rca and snd a bit to get them more centered\r\n     Thanks to lincomatic at Thingiverse\r\n     Added option for GPIO side hole in bottom or top\r\n     Added showing GPIO pins with component drawing\r\n\r\nIf it fits or doesn't, please let me know.. \r\n\r\nThe bottomholder_frame.stl is a standlone minimal frame for a RPi.\r\nAll the other bottom_xxx and top_xxx.stl files can be combined.\r\nIf you want something specific just take the openscad file and alter it, or just ask..."
