UPDATED: 03/06/2013 Added Help file for creating fonts.   
I have looked everywhere for an easy way to write on my 3d objects. Everything I could find was hard to manipulate, so I decided to give it a shot myself. Hope you like this as much as I do. I'll try to answer any questions you have.   

write.scad Routines:  
write()  
writecube()  
writesphere()  
writecylinder()  
writecircle()  

Fonts:  
letters.dxf (change in write.scad)  
orbitron.dxf   
braille.dxf  
knewave.dxf  
BlackRose.dxf

writecylinder specs in testwritecylinder.scad

Be glad to add more fonts if requested, or give details to make your own.""" ;
