It will fit at 1/2 scale though.\r\n\r\nThis set has been scaled to fit on the build platform of the Thing-O-Matic (It's 1/4 scale of the original)\r\n\r\nThis object was created in OpenScad (inkscape to make some of the shapes). I drew it by looking at pictures, so the scale is probably not all that accurate. \r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SRW2wSRrGdE"
