function = "Based on Jetty's buzzer Support (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16170), this hack uses a common household wireless doorbell system (instead of a piezo buzzer) so when your bot is done printing it triggers the receivers to chime throughout the house. I have two wireless receivers in different locations in the house linked to the makerbot. A different sound is triggered by the bot than by the actual doorbell (could be confusing otherwise!)"
