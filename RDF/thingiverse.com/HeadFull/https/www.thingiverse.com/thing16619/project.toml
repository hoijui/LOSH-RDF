function = "I made these simple little hooks to fix a broken washing hanger, but they turned out to be pretty useful for other stuff too. They can be linked together to make a chain. Maybe useful for filament or cable guide. If you attach one end to a rubber band and tie it to your bot somewhere then clip the filament into the other end of the hook, the hook can be used to gently guide your filament."
