function = "A filament guide suspended by 4 elastic bands in the central space at the top of your MakerBot. I have the MakerBot Filament Spool Holder (thing:7105) mounted on top of my bot, which works great, but without a little guidance I find the filament feeds off the reel at too steep an angle which causes friction. This guide gently pulls the filament into the center above the extruder and the natural curve of the filament elevates the point at which it leaves the reel."
