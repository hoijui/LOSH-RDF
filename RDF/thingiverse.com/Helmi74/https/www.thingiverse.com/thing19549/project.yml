function: "This is a stand for a scraper made with this scraper handle for matte style blades http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13045\r\n\r\nIt has room for a \"heavy\" inlay - i used a piece of lead plate (rc pilots always have some of that laying around) but you can also use any other piece that's a bit heavy to give the stand a bit more mass.\r\n\r\nSketchup file is included so modify it at your will."
