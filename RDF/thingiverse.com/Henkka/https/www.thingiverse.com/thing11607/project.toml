function = "Universal hook to hang things from round bars.\r\n\r\nThis hook is suitable for bar diameters between ~13 - 25 mm. The hook has 2 ends - one more \"open\" and other \"more closed\". It is meant that bar goes to \"more closed end\" and stays there \"locked in place\" - eg. once the hook is attached, you can even turn hook upside down and it won't fall. Items will hang from more \"open\" end.\r\n\r\nWe use it in our baby carriage to hang light shopping bags and other light items. I also use this at my workshop to hang various tools from my tool-trolley handle."
