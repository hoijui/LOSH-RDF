function: "BotBot can print anything he can see - he has a \"Level 2 Integraded 3D scanner\" embedded to his head. His main-supporting frame hides a full 3D printer. \r\n\r\nBotBot has also rocket-booster-boots so he can quickly fly to a location where 3D printing help is needed most.\r\n\r\nHis mission in life is to help other robots and bot operators by supplying parts for them.\r\n\r\nIn the pictures you can see how BotBot helped Bobblehead Bob by printing some spare pintacks for Bob. Should BotBot ever malfunction himself, other bots can always use that integraded operating panel with LCD-display and cursor keys in BotBot's chest to print spare parts for BotBot himself. Thus BotBot can not only repair other bots but BotBot can be used to repair himself :)\r\n\r\nBotBot uses slightly modified pintacs from \"Toy-robot-toolkit\" and BotBot would like to thank the creator of that toolkit and Bobblehead Bob for great inspiration - thanks Tony !\r\n\r\nBotBot was modeled partially with Alibre Design and partially with Openscad and it was printed with Makerbot Cupcake CNC printer in red/white theme.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 29.9.11: Missing torso hinge parts uploaded to separate .zip-file as Alibre and STL-files."
