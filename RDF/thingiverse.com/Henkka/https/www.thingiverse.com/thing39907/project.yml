function: "You can use this dice for whatever \"randomizing\" purpose you have.\r\n\r\nRandomize names/numbers/items/alphabet - whatever you want.\r\n\r\nJust print the dice, take 6  paper notes, draw / print items to be randomized to the papers and glue papers to the sides of the die.\r\n\r\nMy son uses this to randomize next \"super-power\" he will use  during their plays. So if it shows wings, he'll have ability to fly etc. :) This was his original idea and we designed this together in Alibre.\r\n\r\nDice is easy to scale and print in necessary size. First prototype has about 60 mm side and seems to fit hands of 6 yrs old very nicely."
