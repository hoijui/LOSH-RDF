function: "Short version\r\n\r\nThis is an round case for Atmel DB101 prototype board.\r\n\r\nLong version\r\n\r\nI'm using Atmel DB101 as an small graphical display in few electric car conversions. This case protects the prototyping board while providing nice round appearance. This also provides nice way of mounting the unit to the dashboard of the car. Current software version can read messages from CAN-bus and display them in simple graphical form.\r\n \r\nAs everything mounted to the dashboard should have round corners (at least 3 mm radius), this thing has rounded corners facing the driver. DB101 board should have snug fit, in fact it should stay there with just some foam between the back of the case and the electronics. Lens is clear polycarbonate.\r\n\r\nMounting-part has an narrow point where it will bend and/or crack in case of impact if needed. Mount can be attached in an angle, depending if you are mounting this to the car or to the motorcycle etc. I have test-mounted this to many different vehicle types and it seems like a fairly good compromise.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in previous versions and what lead to this design, read more from my project-page at http://yty.net/c/Random_EV_does_Cagiva/INSTRUMENTS.html. There is also link to an software-repository for the software part of this project.\r\n\r\nPrints in the pictures are printed with some commercial printer, I don't know the make but was impressed with the quality of the parts. In fact this was the thing that got me to build my own 3D printer - I got an opportunity to design this case and get it 3D printed. After I saw the result, I was sold to the idea of 3D printing. After few months, I had my own kit-build  3D printer up and running.\r\n\r\nOriginal design files are in Alibre format.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Forgot to add slightly related video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7SJQmAKvDk - there you can see the first version of this prototype casing, mounted to the \"eCagiva\" electric motorcycle. I'm partially driving INSIDE the prototype-workshop at the Tampere Electric Vehicle Center (we do Open Source electric car conversions there), so you can see other EV's there too."
