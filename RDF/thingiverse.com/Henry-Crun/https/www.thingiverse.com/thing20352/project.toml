function = "A ring, decorated with the white mana symbol from Magic: The Gathering. The ring is currently sized for a 21mm diameter finger. Note that the symbol is backwards: this is to make the resulting wax seal pressed from the ring the correct image. If you care more about the ring than the seal, just take the mirror image of it."
