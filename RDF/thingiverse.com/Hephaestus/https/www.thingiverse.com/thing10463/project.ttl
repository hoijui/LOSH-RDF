So I took the best features on what I tried so far and redesigned them to this form.  I have been very happy with it so far and I no longer worry about kinks in the plastic filament anymore. \r
\r
BTW...this design should allow you to mount 2 spools on your TOM at the same time.  If that is something you would like to do.""" ;
