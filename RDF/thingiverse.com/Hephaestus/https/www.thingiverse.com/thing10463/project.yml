function: "I have been trying out some of the various spool holder designs on Thingiverse and none of them completely worked very well.  So I took the best features on what I tried so far and redesigned them to this form.  I have been very happy with it so far and I no longer worry about kinks in the plastic filament anymore. \r\n\r\nBTW...this design should allow you to mount 2 spools on your TOM at the same time.  If that is something you would like to do."
