function = "I am just learning about OpenSCAD (my 1st day with it today).  I was thinking a great test piece to print out when I get and assemble my MakerBot kit in a month, would be a ruler sized to the stage limits.  The large marks should be centimeters and the smaller marks millimeters. The minimum resolution I used was 0.2 mm.  Sorry but I do not know yet how to put letters or numbers on it yet.\r\n\r\nI can not wait to test this print.  I expect (if it works) I will go around the house with it to eyeball things I could print out.  Also, it will be good since I can never find a ruler or straight edge when I need it."
