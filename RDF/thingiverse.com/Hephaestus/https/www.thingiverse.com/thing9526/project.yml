function: "This is a project I am working on for a custom form-fitted box for a component.  I thought I could share the outer box.  The top and bottom pieces are not equally deep (for better part placement and handling).  There is a snap-together hinge on the back and a simple latch on the front.  In a later iteration, I could make nested lips on the top and bottom for a better seal.  Be warned, I haven't double-checked all of the dimensions yet.\r\n\r\nI will upload a picture of any test prints I do once I get my Makerbot kit and assemble it (in about a month).\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added a 2nd version of the top with possibly more print-friendly hinge (small notches instead of holes)."
