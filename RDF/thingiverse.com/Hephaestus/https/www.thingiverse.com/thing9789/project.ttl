    okh:function "One of the things I have purchased in the past (and are usually not very cheap) and could be effectively printed by my MakerBot (which I am still waiting for my kit) would be molecular model kits.  I quickly made up some common bond configurations and types.  I will probably add some more once I actually have a MakerBot to test the prints.  I kind of eyeballed the tetrahedral atom so print that at your own risk (as with the rest of it).  I am also including the scad files so you can add additional types, change the relative atom sizes (to represent the relative sizes of different elements), bond lengths, and so on." ;
