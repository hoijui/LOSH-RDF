function: "UPDATE:  The site has been moved to:  \n\nhttp://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/  \n\n\nIn honor of Space Month, and for those who may be waxing nostalgic about the last shuttle flight, I wanted to share a NASA website I found with free 3D model files of numerous spacecraft:  \n\n\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/3d_resources/models.html  \n\n\n\nSeveral examples are attached.  They are in 3ds format, which I was able to import to Google sketch, but I have not been able to export them to an stl file yet.  If someone is able to do this, please post the procedure for us challenged newbies.  Thank you."
