function: "A remix of Maurits' fan duct, designed for Rostock style printers to attach a 40mm fan. It is designed to work with Jason's LED ring (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32472) and is set for the proportions of Steve's hot-end for the Rostock Max.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 is much easier to print, gives you a choice of two different mounting plates and allows for fast removal of the duct for maintenance of the nozzle.\r\n\r\nEdit 12.03.2013: Both versions are designed for the first gen nozzle! They don't necessarily work with \"THE NEW\" nozzle!"
