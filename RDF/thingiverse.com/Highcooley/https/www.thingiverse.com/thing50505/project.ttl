    okh:function """Leveling aid for Onyx heated bed (280 mm diameter) to fine tune delta radius and Z level.\r
\r
It is a two concentric circle print with 12 marked measuring spots plus center. The layer is 0.3 mm thick, has 1mm wide lines and the two circles have diameters of 240 mm and 120 mm at their outer rims.\r
\r
The outher rim of the part sets Rostock Max delta rods completely vertical closest to the three columns.\r
\r
V2 is for people like me, who have a fan attached to the moving plarform to the same side as the extruder mount is attached to the printer.\r
\r
As requested, there is another version for 200 mm boards (180 mm and 90 mm circle) as well as a version with only the inner 120 mm circle.""" ;
