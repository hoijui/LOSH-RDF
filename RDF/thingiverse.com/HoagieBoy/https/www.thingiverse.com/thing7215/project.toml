function = "Added a platform base to the model so as to better match kintel's Stormtrooper\r\nhead http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:588.\r\nSimilar process to what arhimed http://www.thingiverse.com/arhimed and Ulf http://www.thingiverse.com/Ulf have done to clean up Bre's version, except in Netfabb Studio basic alpha using a fair bit of hand cleaning.  Still not a perfect model by Netfabb's analysis, but skeinforge gives no complaints whatsoever."
