function = "I downloaded the primary model from MakerBeck and worked from there. The original print was going to take 7 hours and a good amount of material, so I wanted to try and make a more minimal design. I split the stand into two smaller pieces and added a support piece to hold them together. I got the print time to around 3 hours using 10% infill and am quite happy with this stand.\r\n\r\nhobiej.blogspot.com"
