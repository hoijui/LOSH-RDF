function = "I had a really annoying problem with my extruder - the filament smoothed to the side after 10-30 mins of printing. the Topwadeguide moved up after a while, and the filament pushed aside. I tried to change my topwadeguide from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7700 to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10735. it was helpful but didn't fixed the problem. my design came in order to force the filament get inside straight.\r\nin addition I printed this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11521 filament guide, and together it fixed the problem."
