Ghosts in the form of gifts is a series of objects that are replicas of artifacts imagined as lost, hidden or misregistered during the Museum of New Zealandâ€™s tenure in the former Museum Building on Buckle St, now occupied by Massey Universityâ€™s College of Creative Arts. The objects have been created through a process of drawing, digital 3D rendering, and finally printing with the RepRap.\r
