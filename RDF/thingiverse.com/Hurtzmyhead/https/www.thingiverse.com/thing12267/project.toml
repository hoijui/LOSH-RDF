function = "A stepper motor wire winder. Great for creating electromagnet coils, and other cool stuff. In the future it would be cool to have some sort of a guiding arm to do precision spaced coils, and a wire cut off/coil slide off/new coil start mechanism. But this should get people who know how a proper wire wrapping machine should work to start thinking."
