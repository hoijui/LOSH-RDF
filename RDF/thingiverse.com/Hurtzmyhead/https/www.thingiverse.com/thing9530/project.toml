function = "I was only able to find a adapter to 2\" pipe. However it can be reduced further (about 1/2\" or if you have a lathe, .68\" is the approximate size of a paintball [it can vary]). It can be used in the current state to fire paper wads containing loosely packed paintballs to achieve a shotgun effect. I am not responsible for injury or damage incurred by this device as it can be dangerous if use carelessly."
