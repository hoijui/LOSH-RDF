function: "This is a replica of the Stealth boy from fallout 3/ Fallout new Vegas. I was originally planning to print from the in game model but the resolution of the model was way too low so this was made from the ground up with reference to the in game files. I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve tried to get the scale accurate to 1:1 by eye but obviously there are no exact measurements available."
