    okh:function """This is a replica of the Small energy cell Ammunition for the Laser pistol in fallout 3/ Fallout new Vegas. Iâ€™ve made two versions of this; one is fully printed and accurate to the game files but with a far higher detail level. The other was designed when I noticed that the cells in the item are almost exactly the same size as AA batteries and is designed to accommodate three of them making an actually functional cell (Iâ€™m actually thinking of designing a battery compartment to fit these, it should be trivial)\r
Iâ€™ll put up a better pic as soon as I receive the grey filament Iâ€™ve ordered.""" ;
