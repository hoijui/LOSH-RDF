function: "This is a replica of the Small energy cell Ammunition for the Laser pistol in fallout 3/ Fallout new Vegas. I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve made two versions of this; one is fully printed and accurate to the game files but with a far higher detail level. The other was designed when I noticed that the cells in the item are almost exactly the same size as AA batteries and is designed to accommodate three of them making an actually functional cell (I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m actually thinking of designing a battery compartment to fit these, it should be trivial)\r\nI\xE2\u20AC\u2122ll put up a better pic as soon as I receive the grey filament I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve ordered."
