function = "This is a replica of a Holotape/Holodisk from Fallout 3/New Vegas. I based this design on the in game texture as the in game model for this item is just a rectangle. Iâ€™ve tried to keep it as accurate as possible but the only source image is the 128x128 texture which isnâ€™t very detailed so I improvised a little with some parts.\r\n I designed this to fit the 4mm tape found in a conventional audio cassette and to have a fully operational mechanism so it should be theoretically possible to make a fully working player for one of these with a little effort.\r\n\r\nedit:- just added a new pic of the inside with the tape installed\r\n\r\nUpdate:- it Works! sort of, just did a very quick and dirty test with parts from an old walkman and a dirll and it plays, not very well but with a proper player it would be much better. see here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM91xYbEtww"
