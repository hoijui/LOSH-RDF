\r
Gonna try to sneak a test print at work tomorrow and check the fit. I need to come up with a way to hold the extruders down when closed.\r
\r
I added the sketchup model, feel free to improve on this design, or tell me why you think it's no good. Thanks!\r
\r
Update 02.25.13 proof of concept looks good, needs some tweaks. Gonna add a small cylinder across all 3 hinges at the rear to insert a pin for a lock/stop. Probably get rid of the plates sticking off the rear (was extra motor support). Have to wait until the weekend, busy busy.\r
\r
03-02-13 update:\r
made lots of little tweaks. tried adding nut traps, but the force was not with me today- (I'm just learning sketchup). I laid the revised parts out in a nest including belt clamps, and added pads because I've been getting a lot of curling. I hope this helps. I also added the updated sketchup file if anyone wants it.\r
\r
03-03-13:\r
 Added nut traps.\r
\r
03-07-13:\r
 Finalized design. This is the print that I am going to try and use. I deleted the older files, as they were experimental to begin with.\r
 The updated parts are in the "nest" sketchup file, the other one has the extruder models in it.""" ;
