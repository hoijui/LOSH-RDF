    okh:function """Before I started building a MendelMax Reprap, I laid out all of the components in CAD.  I couldn't decide how to neatly mount all of the electronics until I realized there was all that space inside the base of the frame.  So, I dreamed up these "lifters" along with split Y-Rod mounts (thing:16019) and here we are.  This allows you to "hide" your power supplier and electronics.\r
\r
Since I had to move the drive system to the outside of the rods, my concern was the rigidity about the Z-axis.  I've since put about 20 hours of printing on this (4.5 hours for the longest print) and have seen no issues.""" ;
