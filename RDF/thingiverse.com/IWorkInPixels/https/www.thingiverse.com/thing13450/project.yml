function: "Whilst ruminating on Project Shellter, I was reminded of visiting seaside towns in Oregon as a kid and seeing necklaces and earrings made by running nautilus shells through a band saw... so, I fired up SketchUp and with the help of skimbal, created a set of earrings which will be a Christmas gift for a good friend of mine.  \r\n\r\nUPDATE:  After talking to some female friends, they suggested the front should be closed, to avoid getting them caught in hair.  I had planned on doing that anyway to make the part a little stronger, so now there's a closed version too."
