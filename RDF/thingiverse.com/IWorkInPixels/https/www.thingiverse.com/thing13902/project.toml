function = "The Ring-A-Thing is a modular ring-building kit that will allow you to press-fit a small cube magnet into the base and glue a washer to the bottom of each design you make, allowing you to switch out designs on your printed ring.\r\n\r\nIt's parametric to finger diameter in mm, but I haven't yet figured out how to keep the diameter of the inset on the top of the ring stable for all ring sizes, so that you don't have to scale your designs.  \r\n\r\nI'm also going to see if I can come up with a better way of attaching the designs than the 3mm magnets, which won't fit inside smaller ring sizes.\r\n\r\nOnce those two issues are figured out, this project will be a go!"
