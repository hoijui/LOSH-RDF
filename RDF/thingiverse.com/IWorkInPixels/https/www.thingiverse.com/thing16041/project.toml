function = "A fashion designer friend of mine had an interesting metal bracelet, and I decided to make my own version in OpenSCAD just to see if I could.\r\n\r\nTurns out I could!\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour of trying different things out, I came up with the file you see here.\r\n\r\nI packed the links together to try to make it as printable as possible, but I don't think it's printable unless you have a powder printer.\r\n\r\nSo if you want one, you'll have to hack it to make it printable.  This was just a good way for me to learn a little more OpenSCAD."
