\r
Turns out I could!\r
\r
After about an hour of trying different things out, I came up with the file you see here.\r
\r
I packed the links together to try to make it as printable as possible, but I don't think it's printable unless you have a powder printer.\r
\r
So if you want one, you'll have to hack it to make it printable.  This was just a good way for me to learn a little more OpenSCAD.""" ;
