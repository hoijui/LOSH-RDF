function: "I have a project for which I wanted some piano keys, so I created this OpenSCAD module to create them.  \n\nThere's an option to label the note names on all of the white keys, but I don't have a dual extrusion machine available this weekend.  I'll add a picture of labeled keys when I get a chance to print some.  \n\npiano.scad is the module... it uses bitmap.scad to render the note names, if you so wish.  \n\npiano_keys.scad is an example file, which prints one octave of keys, sized to easily fit just about any 3D printer, with an M3 hole at the top to put a rod through to hold them all together.  \n\nAdd hardware to the back of them, and you can make this part of all kinds of awesome musical projects!  \n\nOptions:  \n* variable # of octaves  \n* black keys/white keys/both  \n* label notes on white keys  \n* variable sizing and spacing  \n\nI design things in my free time, just for fun.  If you like my stuff, send me some DOGE.  It'll totally make my day!  Thank you.  \n   \nD9hPusbPPdbUXgmsRqRcb7jRisVLnriCuP"
