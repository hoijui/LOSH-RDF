    okh:function """I was impatient today and tried to pull a small PLA part off of the heated build platform of a Replicator immediately after it was done printing.  The part was still VERY soft, and warped beyond usability.  

That got me to thinking about an awesome application for a material that hardens upon cooling... fortune cookies!  

Enjoy.  

I design things in my free time, just for fun.  If you like my stuff, send me some DOGE.  It'll totally make my day!  Thank you.
