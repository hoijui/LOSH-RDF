function: "I was impatient today and tried to pull a small PLA part off of the heated build platform of a Replicator immediately after it was done printing.  The part was still VERY soft, and warped beyond usability.  \n\nThat got me to thinking about an awesome application for a material that hardens upon cooling... fortune cookies!  \n\nEnjoy.  \n\nI design things in my free time, just for fun.  If you like my stuff, send me some DOGE.  It'll totally make my day!  Thank you.  \n   \nD9hPusbPPdbUXgmsRqRcb7jRisVLnriCuP"
