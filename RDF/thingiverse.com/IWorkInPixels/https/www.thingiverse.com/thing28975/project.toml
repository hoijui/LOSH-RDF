function = "To the aspiring troll, the original locking box had one basic design flaw: once closed, it could be re-opened.\r\n\r\nIn this version, I have fixed that design flaw, allowing for increased awesome in applications involving high-amplitude, audio-waveform-generation-based lulz.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can hand it to your *really* clever friends and claim that it's a Japanese puzzle box.\r\n\r\nOr waterproof it, put some awesome stuff in it, and bury it in the back yard as a time capsule.  Really, the sky's the limit!\r\n\r\nI've also added an alternate lid if you would like your box to be a piggy bank.  If you want your money back out of it, you'll have to smash it.  Just like the good old days!"
