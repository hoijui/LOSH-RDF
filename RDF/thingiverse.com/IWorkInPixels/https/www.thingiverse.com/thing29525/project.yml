function: "Last night I played my first few games of Palago, and decided that I was going to want a box to carry around all these awesome Palago tiles in.  So, after I got home I fired up OpenSCAD, edited the palago tile file, and made one!\r\n\r\nIt has a lid with a .5mm gap on each side... it should press-fit nicely and stay shut.  Each cell holds 16 Palago tiles, for a grand total of 48.  :)"
