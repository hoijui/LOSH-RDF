Now that I have access to cheap and rapid prototyping, it's time to revisit that project, and see if I can print a coin mech and a mechanism to dispense cans of soda, and wire all that up with an arduino and put it inside a wooden box.\r
\r
Toward that end, here's my first pass at a printable coin mech, based on this video:\r
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85C4eh0mEJg\r
\r
If you want to hack with me, the repo is here:\r
https://github.com/iworkinpixels/Printable-Coin-Mech\r
\r
TODO:\r
1: Coin return.  The cradles need to be on a hinge, and a coin return lever needs to open up the coin mech when pushed.  This is especially important because if the mech rejects a slug, it will usually do so by getting stuck in the mech.  We need a way for the next user to clear the mech, or this is a clear DoS attack vector. :)\r
\r
2: Failsafe.  If the machine is off, a lever which is normally held out of the way by an electromagnet should be released and push the coin mech open.\r
\r
3: Switches.  At the back of each coin chute should be a mounting point for a switch.\r
\r
4: Storage.  Each denomination of coin should fall into its own coin tube.\r
\r
5: Rejection of objects larger than a quarter.  At the very top of the mech, discs which are larger than a quarter should be automatically rejected.  This may just be handled by making the coin slot to the outside of the machine just big enough to take a quarter.\r
\r
6: Escrow.  Not necessary, but it'd be nice if the coins that you have placed in the machine should be held in escrow until you dispense a soda, and returned to you if you press the coin return button.\r
\r
UPDATE 9/16/12:  IT VERKS!!!\r
\r
I just got my first test rig printed, and (when I use pretend force instead of actual counterweights) it works!  Now all I need to do is add some real counterweights and some switches and we should be in business!""" ;
