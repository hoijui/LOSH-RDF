function = "This isn't done yet (I still need to add connectors for hoses and to attach each tray to the frame of the aquaponic garden), but it's a proof of concept of a printable tray with integrated bell siphon.  This grow bed is big enough to hold some decent sized plants, but totally printable on a Replicator 1 build platform.  \n\nI design things in my free time, just for fun.  If you like my stuff, send me some DOGE.  It'll totally make my day!  Thank you.  \n   \nD9hPusbPPdbUXgmsRqRcb7jRisVLnriCuP"
