function = "A while back I printed a copy of the Printable unicorn then sat around scratching my head about what to use as a linear rail. A while later I was pulling apart an old DVD drive when I found two 2.9mm rods.\r\n\r\nArmed with my trusty digital calipers and pro desktop, I reverse engineered the print head of the printable unicorn with two arms extending backwards with two verticle guide holes, then designed two side brackets to hold the rails.\r\n\r\nI used melted ABS (with auto paint thinners) to glue the side rails to the body of the unicorn and then assembled it. \r\n\r\nWhen I'm done I will cut off the rails so that they don't extend past the top of the side rails!\r\n\r\nNow I just have to get it working! ;)\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry about the size of the .avi, I'm just recovering from a catastrophic SSD failure and I havenâ€™t got around to installing my file conversion software!"
