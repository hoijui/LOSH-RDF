function = "Laser cutter coolant flow sensor. \r\n\r\nThe concept was to have a sensor that wasn't inline with the coolant line and couldn't restrict the flow if it seized up. I'm sure that the design is scaleable within reason for other projects. It is simply tywrapped to the outlet end of the coolant pipe and dunked in the coolant reservoir/bucket.\r\nThe sensor is a simple hall effect switch.\r\n\r\nBTW, if anyone knows how to embed a YouTube link to movie, let me know - the movie is at the bottom :-)"
