    okh:function """A spile is used to harvest tree sap for the purpose of making syrup.  Around February to April the sap starts flowing in the tree and can be harvested.  A hole is drilled into the tree slanting upward at a 15 degree angle.  Insert the tube into the tree and put screws in the two holes in the sides of the base.  Screw in a 2 liter bottle and wait for it to fill.  Boil down and enjoy.\r
\r
I intend to flare the top of the tube out at the base to get a better seal on the hole but could not figure out how as this is the first thing I've ever designed in cad.  I also acknowledge that there is not a flat spot for a printing base.  Hopefully either I or one of you out there who has a clue what you are doing will modify this so it's printable on a RepRap before my printer arrives.""" ;
