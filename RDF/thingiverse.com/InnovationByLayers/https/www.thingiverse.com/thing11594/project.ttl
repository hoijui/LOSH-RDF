I've also made an attempt to make it printable. However, since my printer is currently down for repairs, i'm hoping someone else will give it a shot and let me know how it goes!\r
\r
Obviously design credit goes to lucas film, but the 2d design files came from the r2 builders group, and the 3d is the result of days and weeks of modeling and guessing. May the force be with you :)""" ;
