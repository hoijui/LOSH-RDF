function = "In honor of the end of David Tennant\\'s Doctor, I decided to model a small version of the Tardis. The Original model was much bigger, but in order to save space and plastic I scaled it down, so some of the detail has been lost. It is very rough right now, so I\\'d love it if anyone wants to enhance it let me know, or link to this so I can see your version! I used Autodesk inventor to do the modelling.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I added tardis_scaled.stl which is a little larger, giving it some better definition and I also hollowed it out so the print didnt use so much plastic.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Makerbot now sells blue plastic, if anyone prints this in blue, please post!"
