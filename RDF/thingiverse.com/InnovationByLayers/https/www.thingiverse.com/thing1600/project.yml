function: "Based on an idea I got from MakerBlock, I decided to create a Dalek from the 2005 series. I've used drawings from various groups to create it, so it should be to scale. However, I haven't quite worked out how to attach the eye, plunger, and gun yet, so that will hopefully be in a posted update soon. I could use any suggestions on attaching them!\r\n\r\nThanks"
