function: I have a while before I can upgrade to the next droid phone, so I wanted to create a hack that allowed me to have a front facing camera without taking apart the phone. So this basically holds a few mirrors and allows you to use the regular camera as a front facing one as well. Its still a work in progress and you can see the camera/mirror quality isnt all that great, but I was hoping to get your feedback and make this better.
