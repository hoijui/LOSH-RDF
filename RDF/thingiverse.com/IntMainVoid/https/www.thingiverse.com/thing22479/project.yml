function: This is my attempt at the radio found in the Portal series. It is a hollow body is at a 1:1 scale (27 cm long by roughly 16 cm high (11 inchs by 6&1/2 inch)) This was modelled using a screenshot I took of the radio in game and a rule so has to properly position and dimension things (with some artistic license)
