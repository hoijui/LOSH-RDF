function = "This is a detailed 1:1 scale model of the M-300 Claymore from the Mass effect games. It is roughly 470 mm long or just over 1.5 ft. Modelled from multiple reference pictures in google sketchup. \r\n\r\nMy friend who will be attending a convention this fall requested this item for his costume. A week and a half later this is what we have.\r\n\r\n\"The Claymore used to be a hard-hitting but poor-selling shotgun due to kickback problems snapping the arms of anyone but krogan firing the weapon.\" - Mass Effect 3\r\n\r\nReference images retrieved from: \r\nhttp://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/M-300_Claymore\r\nhttp://troodon80.deviantart.com/\r\n\r\nAll Credits to EA/Bioware/All applicable parties involved in the creation of the Mass Effect Saga."
