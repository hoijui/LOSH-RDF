    okh:function """GoPro hero 2 generic mount and bits, ive seen some on here before but i was looking to make a specific mount for my own needs, so a side effect was i had to measure up and draw out the original design and do a couple of test prints to get a good fit, so i thought i would upload them too, its a nice fit on the standard gopro camera mount, no slop and not too tight, i have included the drawing files from autocad 2004 format, i guess i could save out other formats if needed, i included a few images of my special mounts too, its easy to edit the generic dwg file to make one for your own needs, but keeping the typical gopro connection.\r
