function = "contour camera generic mount and bits, ive seen some on here before but i was looking to make a specific mount for my own needs, so a side effect was i had to measure up and draw out the original design and do a couple of test prints to get a good fit, so i thought i would upload them too, its a nice fit on the standard contour Trails mount, no slop and not too tight, i have included the drawing files from autocad 2004 format, i guess i could save out other formats if needed."
