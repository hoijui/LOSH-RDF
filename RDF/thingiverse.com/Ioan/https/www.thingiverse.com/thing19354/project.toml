The vortex tube exhaust at one end hot air and at the cold end cool air at as low as -25 degree Celsius from a compressed air source at 5 bar.\r\n\r\nSome links to vortex cooling chocolate:\r\nhttp://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_145191_en.html\r\nhttp://blog.exair.com/2011/11/01/refrigerated-air-from-compressed-air/"
