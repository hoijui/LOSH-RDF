function: "It is to be used to instantly cool 3d printed chocolate with an -15 degree Celsius air stream.\r\n\r\nThis is a Ranque-Hilsch effect vortex tube cooler inspired by this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8114 \r\n\r\nThe chocolate cooler can be helpfull for those of you who are using the Chocolate Extruder thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18017\r\n\r\nBecause printed hot chocolate layers are to be hardened before they will support the next hot chocolate layer there is a necessity to quickly cool the chocolate filament after it was printed. \r\n\r\nThe vortex tubes are used in industry for spot cooling applications so the idea is to spot cool the chocolate as well. The vortex tube exhaust at one end hot air and at the cold end cool air at as low as -25 degree Celsius from a compressed air source at 5 bar.\r\n\r\nSome links to vortex cooling chocolate:\r\nhttp://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_145191_en.html\r\nhttp://blog.exair.com/2011/11/01/refrigerated-air-from-compressed-air/"
