function = "This is a simple design but since I havn't seen one on here I thought I would upload it. This is my first OpenSCAD project. An apollonian cone is a teaching tool to illustrate \"conic sections.\" Starting with a basic cone: a horizontal slice reveals the circle, a slanted horizontal slice reveals the ellipse, a straight vertical cut reveals the hyperbola, and a slanted vertical cut reveals the parabola. Simple, elegant, conversation piece."
