function = "This spaces the 10mm Y-axis rods of a MendelMax further apart. I have a large print bed that rocks in the X direction when printing. By spacing the rods further apart, I hope to stabilize my print surface and possibly create enough space for dual Y-axis motors. From rod center to center is 240mm."
