This is a version of the logo generated by tracing the b&w image in sketchup and extruding, then running it through SkeinForge (SkeinFox actually) to create the GCode for printing on my Makerbot (Goldbot).\r\n\r\nThe Gcode is set to print at 245degC with a raft, because thats what works on Goldbot.  If you want something different, run it through skeinforge again."
