function = "To honor Epic Fu< (http://www.epicfu.com/)  visiting CrashSpace (http://crashspace.pbworks.com/) March 2010, Sean asked me to create a 3d version of their logo for the Makerbot.  This is the result, along with several of the files I used in the process to create the STL.\r\n\r\nFirst I used Preview (OSX) to convert an EPS version of the logo to PNG. Then I used GIMP to clean it up and created two pngs - the base (rect) and letters. I imported these into Inkscape individually and used the Path-trace bitmap tool to create paths, and saved as SVG. Then I imported these into Blender, scaled, extruded, positioned, and converted to mesh. Then I appended the base/rect mesh to the letters mesh and converted to STL.\r\n\r\nThe Inkscape-Blender part is actually more complex. I found it necessary to use Inkscape Path-break apart, and some other cleanups to make it work. Also Blender didnt like loading multiple svg, so I had to quit and restart it for each model.  \r\n\r\nI have not yet successfully printed the object, as my bot keeps having feed problems. I'm sharing files to date so others can try.\r\n\r\nI also wrote up a bit more how-to over on http://wiki.makerbot.com/making-a-3d-logo"
