function = "A Project to make Replacement parts for Beyblade Metal Fusion(TM). So far, I have made a standard Performance Tip called Beyblade Base.stl  \nIf you noticed, the first and last picture/file are the same except one id upside down. I recommend printing the upside down one.  \nThe last 4 files are .wings files in case you want to edit it.  \nI added Beyblade Bases 6 and 7, and hopefully, they will be more printable.  \n\nUpdate: 8/21/2014  \nA fixed version of Face_Bolt's has been uploaded which fixes an issue where the threads' direction was reversed."
