    okh:function """A Project to make Replacement parts for Beyblade Metal Fusion(TM). So far, I have made a standard Performance Tip called Beyblade Base.stl  
If you noticed, the first and last picture/file are the same except one id upside down. I recommend printing the upside down one.  
The last 4 files are .wings files in case you want to edit it.  
I added Beyblade Bases 6 and 7, and hopefully, they will be more printable.  

Update: 8/21/2014  
A fixed version of Face_Bolt's has been uploaded which fixes an issue where the threads' direction was reversed.""" ;
