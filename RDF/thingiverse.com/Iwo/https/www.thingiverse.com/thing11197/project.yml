function: "This thing is a fan-powered air mixer that fits into a standard round air conditioner outlet.\r\n\r\nThese outlets use an adjustable cone to blow cold air along the ceiling, which provides a even temperature distribution in the room.\r\n\r\nDuring winter however, while the aircon operates in reverse cycle for heating, this outlet arrangement only provides a hot ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe obvious solution is to remove the adjustable cone, which allows a column of warm air to exit the outlet, hit the floor and distribute across the floor. Thus achieving yet again an even room temperature.\r\n\r\nThis approach has two drawbacks - one is the noticeable column of air and the other is the somewhat industrial look of the outlet.\r\n\r\nThis fan-thing hooks into the outlet and widens the column of air, making it a lot less noticeable. It also makes the outlet look more interesting. The shown color scheme is for the kid's room. :-)"
