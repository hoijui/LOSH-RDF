function = "I have a Prusa i1, and all the spool holders I could find have different measurements between top shafts or other issues. This is designed for 8mm rods, spaced 57mm centres. I have designed this to work for Vik's diamondage 125m Spools, based on 200mm full, and 90mm empty, the filament should not touch threaded rods, using Vik's spool holder and ABEC-9 skate bearings, super smooth filament feed is the goal. I drilled the centre of Vik's spool holders out to Ã˜14mm as the inner race was touching, providing some drag to the holder."
