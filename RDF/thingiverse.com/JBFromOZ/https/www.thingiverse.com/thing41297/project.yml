function: I found a push lawnmower in the Vergeside scrapheap a few years ago, it has served me well, but the rear roller wore through. I fixed this BR (before reprap) with some stainless wire, this worked for a time, but recently the repair broke again, so time to fix again. AR (after reprap) there is a new set of tools, roll on the end cap!
