function = "Balancing robot with printed wheels and structural parts.  It uses a Arduino Uno, accelerometer/gyroscope, and a etched motor/servo PCB shield that I made. \r\n\r\nHere's a video of it in action\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAWjUlzAYf0&feature=plcp\r\n\r\nThe final robot is quite a bit different from the first prototype. You can see the progression of this project here:\r\nwww.jddorweiler.appspot.com/electronics.html#robot \r\n\r\nI've wanted to make a balancing robot for a while but I was always turned away by the cost of all the parts.  I tried to avoid using any expensive electronics or motors and instead tried to use common parts that other might have lying around.  This is pretty much my first arduino/programming/PCB project so I'm sure there is room for others to improve it.  Using servos was a cheap alternative to much more expensive geared motors but they're also a bit slow.  This means that the robot can only recover from small pushes.  \r\n\r\nThe PCB was designed using Fritzing http://fritzing.org/ with help from http://www.fubarlabs.org and code is at http://github.com/jdorweiler/BalancingRobot\r\n\r\nThe board has the H-bridge, which can control two DC motors or one stepper motor, accelerometer/gyroscope, and two servo connections.  The PCB isn't required but I did it for fun.  The three iterations of the robot used a DC motor, stepper, and servo so I though it would be nice to make a board that can handle any of those. \r\n\r\nI got a lot of the code and good information was found from \r\nhttp://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1284738418/all\r\nand \r\nhttp://www.kerrywong.com/2012/03/08/a-self-balancing-robot-i\r\n\r\nIf your making the PCB and using a different accelerometer board, make sure to check the pins.  They're probably not the same and the one I used.   This would be easy to change in the Fritzing file though."
