function = "I wanted to have my godchild's name in toy blocks, so I made the whole alphabet.\r\n\r\nEach cube is 50x50mm and has roudings of 2,5mm. You can't read the letters very good on those pictures, because the blocks had to lay down, with the letters facing upwards for printing. I added 1 file with all the blocks, just so you can see those letters. You can't print that file the way it is."
