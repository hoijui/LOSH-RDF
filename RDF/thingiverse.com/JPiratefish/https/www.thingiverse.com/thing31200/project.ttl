    okh:function "So. I was getting ready for a vendor golf event, and decided that I wanted to somehow get Rodney Dangerfields putter from Caddyshack - however, optics are so old school when the iPhone has everything needed for the ultimate putter.  While out shopping at a sports store, I saw the iPing product (they give their app away, charge $30 for the mount) and I made one - with high hopes that someone wrote the app I so badly wanted." ;
