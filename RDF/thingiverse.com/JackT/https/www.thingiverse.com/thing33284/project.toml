Therefore the design is flexible and the LCD with knob and SD Card, as you can buy for example at\r\nreprapdiscount.com can even be mounted. Because I do not own an LCD, I take over mainly the\r\nmeasurements and the great idea for the reset knob from Chri, find under\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28767."
