function: "First of all, many thanks to Camiel for this very good hardware, it is really amazing.\r\n\r\nThis is a cover for both, for the great GEN6Deluxe PCB and the Arduino with Ramps\r\n1.4 shield. Therefore the design is flexible and the LCD with knob and SD Card, as you can buy for example at\r\nreprapdiscount.com can even be mounted. Because I do not own an LCD, I take over mainly the\r\nmeasurements and the great idea for the reset knob from Chri, find under\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28767."
