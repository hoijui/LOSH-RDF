function: "Double sided keychain; Autobots on one side, Decepticons on the other. \r\n\r\nI had original made it using a mill, but I have since updated the model (size and hole adjustments, since mine broke after two years on my keyring). It was carved from a solid piece of acrylic material (0.125 inches thick).\r\n\r\nThis was not scanned. I imported the appropriate pictures, and then traced the lines to make the features. \r\n\r\n2.3 is meant to be printed\r\n\r\n2.2 has a 0.125 inch border so that it can be milled"
