function: This is my favorite. My high school engineering team was tasked with designing a themed chess set. We went with Star Wars. I got to design the A wing, the y wing, and the Mon Calamari Cruiser. I was most proud of the A wing. It had been challenging to make, but had turned out well in both model and print. My only (slight) regret was the guns were too fragile, and soon broke off and were lost.
