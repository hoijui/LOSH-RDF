function: "The Lily\r\nby William Blake\r\nThe modest Rose puts forth a thorn,\r\nThe humble sheep a threat'ning horn:\r\nWhile the Lily white shall in love delight,\r\nNor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the poem I would have put on the back if it hadn't been so small. Instead, I milled it out of acrylic from one solid piece. It was used as a necklace center piece as a gift to my girlfriend at the time. \r\nCalla 4 can be printed as a pendant."
