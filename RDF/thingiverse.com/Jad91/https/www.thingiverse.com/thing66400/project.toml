function = "A bunch of different insignias from the star wars universe.  \r\nI was experimenting with making files that I could both laser cut and 3D print.   \r\nOpen the SVG file; each insignia has it's own layer and can be easily separated.   \r\n\r\n***Don't mind the apparent scribble in the bottom left corner. As I said, I separated them in to layers, so that I could pick and choose which one to use, and I also tried putting a bunch in the lower left corner so they'd all have the same origin and be easier for manipulating when I imported them into OpenSCAD\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nEdit June 13, 2017:\r\nI realized the file format wasn't really user friendly, so I redid it and added a few more symbols."
