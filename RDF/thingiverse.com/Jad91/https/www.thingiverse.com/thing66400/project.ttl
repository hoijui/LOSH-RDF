I was experimenting with making files that I could both laser cut and 3D print.   \r
Open the SVG file; each insignia has it's own layer and can be easily separated.   \r
\r
***Don't mind the apparent scribble in the bottom left corner. As I said, I separated them in to layers, so that I could pick and choose which one to use, and I also tried putting a bunch in the lower left corner so they'd all have the same origin and be easier for manipulating when I imported them into OpenSCAD\r

Edit June 13, 2017:\r
I realized the file format wasn't really user friendly, so I redid it and added a few more symbols.""" ;
