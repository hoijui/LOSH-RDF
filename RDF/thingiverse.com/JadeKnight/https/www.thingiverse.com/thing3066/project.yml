function: "This is a basic spool holder I designed in Sketchup, after seeing some of the other spool holders here. My version is very simplistic, being just a triangle style frame held together by 1/4\" wooden dowels.\r\n\r\nYou'll need a wire or rope spool from a hardware store, or another type of spool to utilize this holder. I am designing a printable spool that will be compatible with this holder, which I will add to this thing when I have it finished.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal holes do have a bit of an 'unsupported overhang' at the top, however mine printed without any issues (as you can see in the image). Your mileage may vary ;-)."
