function = "I printed Emmetts gear bearing and noticed it is a good heart for planetary gear. So I customized it with three planet gears and designed the handles. Holes by drilling and assembled with screws.\r\n\r\nEmmett, can you add holes to your gear bearing planets? (And maybe the handles to the customizer too) The result could some day be snap-on planet gearing."
