function: "My nut got stuck while wearing in the threads. Luckily I had a 3D printer so that I could print the remedy! I am sure that this have and will happen to more of us, so here you go, fitted wrenches!\r\n\r\nThe inside dimension is 47,5 mm to give a snug fit around bbuonomos bolt and nut found at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4880\r\n\r\nI have included the Solidworks part files as well if you want them.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1:\r\nAfter printing and testing the first wrench I redesigned it and now it prints in less than half the time, and looks cooler :D"
