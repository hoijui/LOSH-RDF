function = "A fully working proof of concept ratchet mechanism made to fit some of the bolt heads found on thingiverse.   \n\nIt's quite sturdy and works surprisingly well! It would be fun to measure the load it can take, I'm guessing plenty!  \n\nThe springs I made works but I have not put much time into making them perfect. Since I like to show the insides to friends the springs should have had a quick release or something."
