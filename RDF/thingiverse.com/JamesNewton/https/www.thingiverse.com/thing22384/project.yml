function: After John made the very nice clip on fan mount for his Maker Gear Mosaic, he mentioned that it could be parametric in OpenSCAD, so I thought I would take a shot at making such a version. It's no were near as nice looking as the original, but smooth curves like that are tough in OpenSCAD... at least for me.
