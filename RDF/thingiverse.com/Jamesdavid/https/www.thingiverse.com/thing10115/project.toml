function = "You need a board holder that is X by Y mm and mounts to holes that are W by Z mm?  This is your script!\r\n\r\nTypically when I need something like this, I am trying to match a board up with a mount that has a different hole spacing.  In this SCAD file, you specify the dimensions of the board, and the distance between the center of the mounting holes.  The script and your 3d printer does the rest."
