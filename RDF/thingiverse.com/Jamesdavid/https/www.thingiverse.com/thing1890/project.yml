function: "I wanted a heated build platform, but I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t have a way to work with metal.  Thus, I designed this Aluminum with NiCr heating element heated build platform to be put together with little modification from parts that can easily be ordered online or picked up at a local store.\r\n\r\n2010-02-28 - UPDATE: Tested it and it works great.  The corners do not melt and, in fact, provide an easy way to handle the hot build platform.\r\n\r\n2010-04-07 - UPDATE: I covered the AL with Kapton tape (1\" strips) and it seemed to work much better than the Lexan, but then my extruder started having \"issues\" so I am fixing that.  I did not re-print the four \"standoff\" pieces when I did this, but one could download the scad file and change the variables to 0 for the lexan height since the small gap is not necessary."
