\r
What I like about this print is how it fails.  The overhangs are pretty much impossible, but through perseverance the honeycomb design eventually overcomes all obstacles.  I thought this was a good metaphor for perseverance in everyday life (mistakes can be built on to achieve success), and I was also reminded that wasp nests and beehives embrace imperfection.""" ;
