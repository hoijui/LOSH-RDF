function: "Looking at the stretchlet, I started doing some experiments printing things that have very thin walls.  For this object I used a honeycomb structure to fill out a sphere, and I made the bottom flat so it would print.  \r\n\r\nWhat I like about this print is how it fails.  The overhangs are pretty much impossible, but through perseverance the honeycomb design eventually overcomes all obstacles.  I thought this was a good metaphor for perseverance in everyday life (mistakes can be built on to achieve success), and I was also reminded that wasp nests and beehives embrace imperfection."
