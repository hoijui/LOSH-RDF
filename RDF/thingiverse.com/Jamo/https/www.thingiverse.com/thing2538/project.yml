function: "A simple printable (mostly) Tesla turbine I made for the make contest to win a makerbot. I'm sorry about the bad previews, they're exports from SolidWorks.\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\nBesides the Printer you need a tap set and a drill. \r\nThe disks and the spacers should be 5 layers thick. \r\nThe alternate Box1-pilot hole part replaces the 1/2in inlet and outlet holes with a .1in pilot hole. (now that I think about it, this should help with sag yes?)\r\n\r\nI have no idea how well it will work, if i understand 3d printing correctly, the disks may warp badly which would ruin the turbine. The plastic probably wont hold up to very high rpm ether."
