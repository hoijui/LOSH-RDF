function = "a small rocket made to fit a rocket engine, type A10-3T. The fit turned out a liiittle tight, but i have now added .5mm to the diameter in the model-.stl. I printed it with 1% infill, but that probably isn't necessary. Also no extra skins. 0,5mm layer thickness. Turned out almost perfect.\r\n\r\nI can change the model quite easy, if people have ideas for minor alterations."
