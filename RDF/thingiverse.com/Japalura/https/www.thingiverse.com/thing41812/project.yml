function: "This is a derivate of the key cam helmet holder by jfpion (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39890) check there first for instructions !\r\n \r\nI love the 40$ cheap and awesome Keycam 808 #16 so why not put two on your helmet and film in 3D stereo. \r\nI used the Thing from jfpion and put two of them together. \r\nI also changed it so it is printable without support. You have to glue the center piece upside down into the holder, it can not fall out by itself though.\r\nI made the main plate smaller but you can use the original one too.\r\n \r\nYou only need 'center piece A', if you dont have a 40mm M5 you might use 'center piece B'  with two shorter screws instead."
