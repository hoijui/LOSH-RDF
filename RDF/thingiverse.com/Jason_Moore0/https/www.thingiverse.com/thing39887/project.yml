function: "Happy new year to all. Here is a layout of parts to make a dice tower. I have not built this. I dont have a laser cutter. I built these plans from scratch, after seeing the tiki tower.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to make one, please send Me a pic at least.  I will add your pic to the images here and note you for reference. I dont know if or when I'll be able to make this myself.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Hello all, Recently fellow Maker skier_forever made my tower from what looks to be black acrylic. It looks sweet. go check out the pics on his profile. and thanks, Skier-Forever. http://www.thingiverse.com/skier_forever"
