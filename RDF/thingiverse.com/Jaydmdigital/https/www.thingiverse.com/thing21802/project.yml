function: "I roast my own coffee. I store it in mason jars (canning jars) and needed a funnel that would allow me to pour the beans into the jars.\r\n\r\nI can't find my store bought one, so I designed my own. This one fits outside the jar. I am including the scad file so feel free to make one for whatever size you need."
