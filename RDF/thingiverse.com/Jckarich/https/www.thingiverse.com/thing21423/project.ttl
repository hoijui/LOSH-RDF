headphones are not the more comfortable but more\r
important than this is the fact that is headphones allow\r
you to isolate from the rest sometimes but what if you\r
could decide either tu use your headphones inside or\r
over you ears? you could still be hearing what happens\r
around you and still listening to music at the same time.\r
This adapter can hold you in ear headphones just a little\r
over you ears, and the shape intents to be open to\r
ambient sounds so the will mix in with the music.""" ;
