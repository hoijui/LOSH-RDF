function: "I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m probably not the only one who thinks in-ear\r\nheadphones are not the more comfortable but more\r\nimportant than this is the fact that is headphones allow\r\nyou to isolate from the rest sometimes but what if you\r\ncould decide either tu use your headphones inside or\r\nover you ears? you could still be hearing what happens\r\naround you and still listening to music at the same time.\r\nThis adapter can hold you in ear headphones just a little\r\nover you ears, and the shape intents to be open to\r\nambient sounds so the will mix in with the music."
