\r
This is a first pass at this, I haven't gotten to cutting it just yet as two or three parts are looking rather fragile and I need to look at some build pics to see if that's going to be a problem or not!\r
\r
If you beat me to cutting one out (which is likely!) then I'd love to hear how it goes.""" ;
