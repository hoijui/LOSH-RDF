function: "I want a MakerBot, and I've got a ShopBot (that we've done a lot with - http://becausewecan.org). So I took the Makerbot laser-cut chassis file, and tried to make it into something a CNC router can cut out.\r\n\r\nThis is a first pass at this, I haven't gotten to cutting it just yet as two or three parts are looking rather fragile and I need to look at some build pics to see if that's going to be a problem or not!\r\n\r\nIf you beat me to cutting one out (which is likely!) then I'd love to hear how it goes."
