function = "This is a clip on attachement to my wooden window blinds, it allows me to hangs a sheet to darken the room.\r\n\r\nI have a projector and a screen, but the sun shines through the blinds degrading my viewing contrast during the day.  This allows a dark sheet to further block the sun without permanantly changing the blinds.\r\n\r\nMy contrast is much better, while still allowing me to easily open the windows."
