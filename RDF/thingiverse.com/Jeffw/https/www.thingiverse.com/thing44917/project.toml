function = "This is a 2 piece swiveling mount for a Grundtal Spotlight, available here:\r\nhttp://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50119351/\r\n\r\nI needed to defuse the lamp light against the ceiling but I wanted an adjustable angle.  The 2 half circles allow 180 degrees of rotation.  Currently the fit is snug, and a doubled over twist tie \"pin\" is keeping alignment.  \r\n\r\nIn the case that over time the fit becomes loose, I will replace the twist tie with a screw and wing nut. As of now, this is not needed."
