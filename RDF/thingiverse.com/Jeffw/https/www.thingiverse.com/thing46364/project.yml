function: "These 10mm Aluminum extrusion mounts are snapped onto the metal top of the Replicator2 frame. The extrusions are mounted all the way around the perimiter.  Using more mini t-slots I can now bolt whatever I want to the printer conveniently.\r\n\r\nAs my design develops I will probably remove older files to add more current ones, I have done this several times already and several of my photos reflect old designs... but you'll get the idea.  \r\n\r\nAll of the acrylic pieces are expected to change demensions as I work out the details... but the snap on replicator mounts are complete."
