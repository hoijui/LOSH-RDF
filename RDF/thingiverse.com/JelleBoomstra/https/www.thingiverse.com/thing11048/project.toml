function = "I really liked birdhouse X, but it had a fatal flaw: the entrance hole was way too big (IMHO). So I reduced the size of it, it's now 25x40mm, which look much more in the ballpark from what I could gather online. \r\nThe other addition that I made is that I thought it looked like a German Cuckoo clock (the ones with a bird that comes out every hour). To keep it simple I changed the clock to a sundial, with the gnomon serving as perch for the birds."
