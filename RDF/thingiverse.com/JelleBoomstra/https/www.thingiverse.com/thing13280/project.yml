function: I really like the flex box, but it lacked a little in size. So I sized it up, gave it press fitting parts and an unobtrusive snap-lock for the lid. On top of that, it was the last day at work for my colleague Siert (who will be working at Ultimaker from now on), so I made this as a gift. Unfortunately Siert himself was ill at the day of his going-away party/mourning, he will have to find out about my gift through thingiverse :)
