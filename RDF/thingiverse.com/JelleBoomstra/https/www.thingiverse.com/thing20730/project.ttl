I wanted a printable and somewhat aerodynamic housing for it, so I whipped up something in Rhino. Printed at 0.1mm x 1mm on an Ultimaker, it looks quite nice. \r
It snap fits together and has access to all connectors, for the video+power connector, the control board and that one I don't know the function of.  Mounting is intended on a piece of plywood into the groove, glued with hotglue (for this revision, I did not like an external nut+bolt)""" ;
