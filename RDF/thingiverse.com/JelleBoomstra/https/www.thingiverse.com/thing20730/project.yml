function: "The sony camera module I bought from http://www.securitycamera2000.com/products/600TVL-SONY-SUPER-HAD-CCD-D%252dWDR-Color-Board-Camera-with-OSD-Menu-DNR.html had obviously no housing. I wanted a printable and somewhat aerodynamic housing for it, so I whipped up something in Rhino. Printed at 0.1mm x 1mm on an Ultimaker, it looks quite nice. \r\nIt snap fits together and has access to all connectors, for the video+power connector, the control board and that one I don't know the function of.  Mounting is intended on a piece of plywood into the groove, glued with hotglue (for this revision, I did not like an external nut+bolt)"
