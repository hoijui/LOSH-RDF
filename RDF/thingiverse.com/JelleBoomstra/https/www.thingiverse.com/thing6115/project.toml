function = "This is my version of the mantis router, http://makeyourbot.org/mantis9-1 as designed originally by David Carr. This design is adapted to metric sizes (do away with Henry IV's thumb!)and enlarged to a groundplate of 30x30 cm. The working volume is slightly more than 190 x 130 x 40 mm, depending on how precise you work."
