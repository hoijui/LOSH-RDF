function: "I just spent far too much of my life making these printable, between fixing mesh issues Slic3r whined about, rotating the objects, and trimming a bit off the arduino bracket that protruded below the Z plane. Thought I would share.\r\n\r\nI uploaded all the individual edited files as well as a plate with all the attached components. \r\n\r\nI'm starting a print now; I'm happy with how it sliced, so I'm hopeful this will actually work.  I'm calling it a WIP until I get a good print out.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
