function = "This is a breakout board for the L293D motor driver chip. It is single sided, and therefore very easy to make. If you don\\'t have EAGLE, you can download the PDF version of the layout.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nI've uploaded gcode for milling the pcb. If the settings aren\\'t optimal for your machine, it should be fairly easy to modify the files."
