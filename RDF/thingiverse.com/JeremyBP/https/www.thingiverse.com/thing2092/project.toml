function = "This is a holder for a NEMA 17 stepper motor. It should be compatible with most motors of that size, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nUPDATE!!\r\n\r\nThis was designed for wall mounting the motor, for an AS220 style drawbot. Since my motor has a small shaft coming out the back, I designed some spacers to allow the mount to sit flat."
