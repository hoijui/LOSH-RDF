function: "This is a cool robot wheel I designed during my lunch period. :) It is scalable, But if You scale it, remember to adjust the axle hole size. I usually make mine at 50% size.\r\n\r\nThis might actually make a decent flywheel if made of metal.\r\nIt was supposed to be a pulley, but made a better wheel.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI added a wheel with five spokes instead of three. It is also smaller."
