function = "I love my makerbot, but the ABS fumes are a bit much for me. I needed a bit more ventilation, so I started using fans. They were large and loud, however, so I went out and bought a fan. I got a 120mm computer fan (ThermalTake Hightst Performance 120mm fan) and designed these brackets to hold it. It sits in thee opening on the left side of my 'bot, and blows most of the fumes out the window. :D\r\n\r\nVideo of the print: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8w2asyvB1U"
