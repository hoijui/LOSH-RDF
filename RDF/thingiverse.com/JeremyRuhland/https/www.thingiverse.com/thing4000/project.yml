function: "The eye of Ionytrix, Farore Nightclaw's wonderful latex hive-mind coyote. \r\nhttp://www.furaffinity.net/view/2372027/\r\nI created this as a birthday present for zir, and I'm open sourcing it so that others can make their own!\r\n\r\nIo's eyes are made of LEDs which spin and blink in patterns, I hear it's quite hypnotic. When I first saw the picture of Io tearing one of its eyes out to get a better look at it I wondered if the blinking would continue outside of its body. I guess it does! @_@\r\n\r\nBuild video: http://www.vimeo.com/14773621\r\n\r\nIonytrix is owned by Farore Nightclaw http://www.furaffinity.net/user/farorenightclaw\r\nEye of Ionytrix is a derivative work released under CC-By-SA"
