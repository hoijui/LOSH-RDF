The original link is http://youtu.be/01rWylsUFTU .  \n\nI also uploaded my slic3r config that I'm using right now. Feedback on how to improve it is welcome!  \n\nUPDATE: If you have been making nozzles like crazy, but need a place to keep them check out the http://www.jerrill.com nozzle case at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:71322"
