function: This is a calibration object, similar to other thin wall box objects.  The walls of this model really are 0.5mm thick.  Despite their name, similar objects previously published here apparently have 0.25 mm thick walls.  With a 0.5mm nozzle, it seems reasonable to try printing walls actually 0.5mm thick.
