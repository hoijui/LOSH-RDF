function: "This Thing currently includes two derivatives of dnewman's monochrome geometric egg thing.\r\n\r\nThe first file (cubses-5stripes) describes 5 rows of 16 cubes in 5 paths total (1 per row) for speedy egg drawing. The original script produces 4 paths per cube with can really slow down an eggbot with all the ups and downs. There are three layers for optional multi-color eggs. The cubes are larger for drawing with Ultra File Sharpie markers.\r\n\r\nThe second file (cubses2) describes a 9x20 cubed egg decoration in one path. Drawing the whole thing in one path saves a lot of time. The thumbnails are deceiving because they only show the first row; the rest of the rows run off of the document. There's an artifact at the end of each row where it draws over the last cube to get to the next row. I might fix this eventually. This cubes are the small original size cubes, they are a little small to be drawn clearly by a UF Sharpie, but the pattern is still nice.\r\n\r\nHappy Easter"
