function = "Everytime i lose my lighter. So i made some a holder which can keep my lighter next to my pack of cigarettes. \r\n\r\nThe hole for the lighter is for a standard lighter which can be bought everywhere. For the pack of cigarettes i think it fits only Marlboro since i don't think all the brands use the same size of package."
