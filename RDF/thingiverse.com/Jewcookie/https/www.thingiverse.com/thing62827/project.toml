function = "This is a 6DOF headtracking clip i made for use with Freetrack. It uses the default settings for a 3 point clip in freetrack.  \r\nFor people unknow to headtracking. This LED clip is used in combination with a Wiimote or a webcam. A piece of software translates your headmovement into motion in games. For example, if i look right my view will pan to the right in my flight sim.  \r\nThe software can be downloaded here http://www.free-track.net/english/  \r\nFor best result use a Wiimote since the infrared camera in the Wiimote is pretty good."
