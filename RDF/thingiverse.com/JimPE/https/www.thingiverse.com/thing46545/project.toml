function = "A fun thing to have.  I have never seen one except in sketches.  You can tell your friends that they inspired it.  It is not a reflection of me.  Approximately 1.2 inches 3 cm OD.  It was a challenge to design due to needing a spherical helix.  If you rotate the screw ball on your screen by holding down an arrow key it looks real cool if it rotates about the center axis. Have fun."
