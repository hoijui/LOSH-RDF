function = "I designed this Adapter in order to connect an Nema 17 stepper motor to an aluminium profile. (see pictures for that :) ) \r\n\r\nThis part works as a bracket to change the holding screws from the front to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe four front screws for attaching the motor to the plate are M3x10mm. The holes in the ground fit M5 screws.\r\n\r\nEdit: I uploaded a second rounded version for bstott :) I know that its still not perfect since the critical parts are not rounded but I had little time to redesign the whole thing to make it more stable..."
