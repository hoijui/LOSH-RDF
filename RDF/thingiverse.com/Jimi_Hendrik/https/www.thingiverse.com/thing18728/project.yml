function: "I build the spaceship from the popular game \"mass effect\" for a friend of mine. (nevermind, he got the game as well :-P )\r\n\r\nThe model is made mostly out of Acrylic, but the brackets need to be printed (guess there are some easier methods as well, but i had little time and the printer was available) \r\n\r\nFeel free to share!\r\n\r\nPS I broke some part of the red plastic you can see on the picture, this was my mistake :)"
