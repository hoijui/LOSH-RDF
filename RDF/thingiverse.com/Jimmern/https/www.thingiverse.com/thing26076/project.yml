function: "Scanned sculpture from the Vigeland Sculpture Park (Frognerparken) in Oslo, Norway. Granite sculpture near the monolith of a man and woman leaning on each other back to back.\r\n\r\n\"Scanned\" with 123D Catch, and partially cleaned up in the 123 app, with some final cleanup in FormZ.\r\n\r\nLack of a view from above has given them somewhat flat heads. This was a first try at this technique.\r\n\r\nEdit: .Stl file updated, scaled and placed on bed for printing.\r\n\r\nEdit2: Cleaned STL with Nettfabb Cloud, reduced file size."
