function: I created a mud tire built around a small rim. The tire has tread on the top part. The rim had 8 holes around the middle. I created this becuase I like quading and off-roading and I though this would be a fun thing to do. I also thought it would provide challenges and obsticles that I wanted to learn how to overcome.
