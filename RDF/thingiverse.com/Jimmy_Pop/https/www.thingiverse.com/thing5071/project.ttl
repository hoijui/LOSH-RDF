Notice this is the first version and as you will see there are a few things which should be improved: the size should be a bit bigger than it is (you may scale it and give feedback on that) and the geometry should be rounded a bit, I made the model by hand extruding parts from a cube and wanted to keep the model with a low polygon cound, but I think I went too far on that." ;
