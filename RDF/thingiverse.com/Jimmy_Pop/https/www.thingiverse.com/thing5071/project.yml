function: 'I took the glasses designed by daewootech to be cut using a laser and created a 3d model which can be printed using a RepRap machine or a Makerbot. Notice this is the first version and as you will see there are a few things which should be improved: the size should be a bit bigger than it is (you may scale it and give feedback on that) and the geometry should be rounded a bit, I made the model by hand extruding parts from a cube and wanted to keep the model with a low polygon cound, but I think I went too far on that.'
