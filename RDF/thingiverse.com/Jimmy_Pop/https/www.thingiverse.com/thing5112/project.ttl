    okh:function """This is a 50cl bottle holder for the fridge. It can be used alone or connected in series for better holding a number of bottles. It may work for wine bottles and 33cl bottles too, but I took as a reference a 50cl bottle and haven't tried it yet with other sizes.  

I am REALLY happy with the mechanism I used to be able to connect this thing in series with other copies of itself. It works quite well even without cleaning the shape with a knife after printing it. Also it can be put into place either by sliding the pieces or by pressing them together and they don't break easily.  

EDIT: there's an improved version of this thing which optimizes the use of material and holds the bottle much better: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5117""" ;
