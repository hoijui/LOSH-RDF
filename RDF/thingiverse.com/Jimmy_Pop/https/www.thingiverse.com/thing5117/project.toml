function = "This the first revision of the original bottle holder with a series of improvements suggested by different people. It is a bit smaller than the previous version, allowing to save a bit of plastic while holding the bottles closer to each other to save space. I also added more connection point so not only you can connect the holder in series but you can also put different rows in parallel to hold the bottle from two points instead of one, making it possible to stack the bottles on top of each other to save space.\r\n\r\nThis version also prints faster and even though maybe the use of material could be further optimized, I do like it very much."
