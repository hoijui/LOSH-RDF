function = "Unprinted/untested Design! This is intended to hold two rechargable AA batteries. Which way you place them indicates whether or not the battery is charged, as displayed by the graphic on the front. OpenSCAD file included that can be configured to any battery size.\r\n\r\nI have a box full of loose rechargable batteries. I never know which are charged and which are not, so I'm hoping printing out a few of these holders will end that problem."
