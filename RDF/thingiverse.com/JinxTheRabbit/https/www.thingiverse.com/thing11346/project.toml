function = "Ok, I'm all for house parties, especially when there's a saucy, sexy, redhead engineer babe that tells you she wants to see your \"makerbot\" in action...\r\n\r\nThis, my maker-friends, is when you need to take a millisecond (or 60000) to ponder what might go wrong. Will she be impressed by your feed rate, or will she marvel at your layer thickness? \r\n\r\nOr, will she be impressed by both and, with a single stroke of her dominant hand, clear the desk of your (pro) soldering iron, calibration cubes, hex wrenches, your Bamboo Fun (pen) tablet, and FULL GLASS OF RED WINE, only to satisfy her technically-motivated libido? \r\n\r\nTake a moment (1000 ms max). She's hot. She's also left-handed, which means if your MakerBot is located to the left of your workspace's epicenter, your makerbot just might get lucky. Let's consider the trifecta of the maker-male's inner drive: #1 Downstairs. #2. Upstairs. #3 Your 3D printer (these are in no particular order)\r\n\r\nWith a quick flip of a switch and a tug (lol) of two (arguably three) cables, your 3D printer is saved. That takes care of #3. As long as you're cognizant of #3's future, #2 doesn't care (its tipsy enough anyway since you decided to put your FULL GLASS OF RED WINE right next to your 3d printer..), which leaves #1. Good ol' #1. He's fine. No comment.\r\n\r\nThis is your fair warning, maker-community!\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nJinx"
