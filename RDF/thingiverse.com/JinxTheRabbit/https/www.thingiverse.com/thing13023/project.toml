function = "Problem: I recently tried to print out Scooter's \"HBP Leveler Part 1A\" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9094, however the support material for the overhang wouldn't stay put during my print, which resulted in a spaghetti pile on my HBP. \r\n\r\nSolution: I added a small raft under the support material using OpenSCAD. Now this part prints like a champ.\r\n\r\nSide note: I take no credit for Scooter's HBP Leveler thing, which is pretty awesome. I only take credit for not having my ToM calibrated as well as Scooter's (thus necessitating this noobie crutch).\r\n\r\nUpdate1: Added an STL that has insets for the round box-head bolts that come with your makerbot. I didn't have any flush bolts, so this was a must for me :)\r\n\r\nUpdate2: Made the insets for the coupling bolts 1.75mm instead of 3mm and removed the inset for the bolt used with the magnet. This allows you to use the smallest box-head bolts that came in your burrito while allowing for enough clearance for the bolts coming from the HBP.\r\n\r\nUpdate 3: Added a palette of thumb wheels. Enjoy the time this will undoubtedly save.\r\n\r\nUse Better_HBP_Leveler_Part1_A_MagnetSupport.stl !"
