    okh:function """The MK6+ is great, but the stock configuration assumes the filament's diameter remains constant.  If the filament gets thinner, the pressure will drop off rapidly and extrusion will stop.  If it gets thicker, steps will be missed, loud noises will be made, and extrusion will slow down.  Either situation can cause a ruined or weakened output.  I was tired of having to babysit it, and I had two extra springs in my Wade's hardware kit, so I designed this spring adapter.\r
\r
Before I installed it, my MK6+ would print for around 30 minutes, on average, before needing tightening or loosening.  Since I've installed it, I've printed for more than eight hours without intervening.  It took my machine from "high maintenance" to "fire and forget.\"""" ;
