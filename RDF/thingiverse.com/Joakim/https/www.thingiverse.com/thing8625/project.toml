function = "A while ago i saw the 8163 Xfollower - and i became interested.\r\nI have designed a replace of the \"idler\" side plywood for the Xcarraige. \r\nIt uses two Ball Bearings (Outer = 8 mm,Width = 4mm,Inner = 3 mm). \r\nThe bronce bushings has to be taken out.\r\n\r\nThis is a reversible modification as you can go back if you need it.\r\n\r\nThe definition is in SCAD and VERY parametric, so you can trim the device as you need. \r\n\r\nAfter installation it might be nessary to re-shim the buildplatform, using the calibration script. \r\n\r\nI have no time for doint the extensive performance measuremnts for the MOD, i hope that others will do something about that. \r\n\r\nI hope the Thing will do some good."
