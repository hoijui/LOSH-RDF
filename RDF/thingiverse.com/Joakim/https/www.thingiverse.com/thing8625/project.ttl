    okh:function """A while ago i saw the 8163 Xfollower - and i became interested.\r
I have designed a replace of the "idler" side plywood for the Xcarraige. \r
It uses two Ball Bearings (Outer = 8 mm,Width = 4mm,Inner = 3 mm). \r
The bronce bushings has to be taken out.\r
\r
This is a reversible modification as you can go back if you need it.\r
\r
The definition is in SCAD and VERY parametric, so you can trim the device as you need. \r
\r
After installation it might be nessary to re-shim the buildplatform, using the calibration script. \r
\r
I have no time for doint the extensive performance measuremnts for the MOD, i hope that others will do something about that. \r
\r
I hope the Thing will do some good.""" ;
