function = "With small printer like Huxley there's no point trying to bolt large filament spool at the side.. so I made this simple self-standing thingy. Originally I hoped the leg-parts alone would be enough, but this spool is a bit too large so I had to design those raiser feet. \r\n\r\nI have used this with Ultimaker 5Lbs spool (4043D natural) and will make adjustments for others as needed."
