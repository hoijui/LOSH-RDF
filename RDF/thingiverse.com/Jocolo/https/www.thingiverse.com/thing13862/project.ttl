Is important that if you want to separate in different parts, you have to do a small axis by way of union between those parts.\r
The axis methos is usefull to unite with your chassis.(Note: the chassis ,which appears here, is back down,then when you have printed the chassis, you're going to realize of that the correct way is the opposite). \r
Enjoy your print!""" ;
