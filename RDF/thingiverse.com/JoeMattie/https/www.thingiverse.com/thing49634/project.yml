function: "This is a spin-off of MikeyB's excellent 3D Printed Quadcopter.  I have made a number of upgrades and modifications.  \r\n\r\nThe arms are now solid.  I ran several tests and the solid arms only weigh around 1.5 grams heavier when printed at 25% infill and are more rigid. \r\n\r\nI beefed up the landing gears after having a few of mine break, and rotated the motor mounts by 45 degrees so that the wiring is neater.   The ESCs mount on the bottom and are enclosed by the ESC covers.  \r\n\r\nThe wiring is contained by the snap-in sidewall covers.\r\n\r\nThe top cover protects your electronics, and has a removable window for those of us with KK2 boards to facilitate tweaking the settings without having to disassemble the quad.  \r\n\r\nI also modified the top plate to accept an FC mounted in either X or + orientation.\r\n\r\nI will update this thing as I continue to mod and update my quad.\r\n\r\nAs of right now, this is 100% tested and working in PLA.  I printed the ESC covers and other cosmetic parts in ABS."
