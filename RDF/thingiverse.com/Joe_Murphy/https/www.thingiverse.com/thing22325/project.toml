function = "Here is a simple Tilt-Shift adapter which will attach to any micro four thirds camera body and hold a Nikon Series E 50mm lens. This adapter will creates a tilt-shift effect or miniature effect in your photos (see examples below). This is intended to be a more durable and cheaper solution than both DIY and commercial lens adapters ($2100). This was designed to be part of the \"Make It Real Contest\" on instructables so if you dIg it - follow this link and vote for my project. Thanks!"
