\r
it's meant to be mounted at the right side of the y-stage (instead of the x-rods end plates).\r
\r
unfortunatelly the chain links are a bit too small to fit the x-cables (the ones for the build paltform plus the one to the x-endstop) into :-(\r
the 'cabin' thing where the y-moving chains are sliding inside is a bit tight as well...\r
-- so consider it as a proof of concept only!\r
\r
I included all the files needed to build those - just in case anyone want to derive from this - any comments much appreciated!\r
(don't look too close at the Inventor files - those are real messy right now as I am far from being an Inventor specialist...)""" ;
