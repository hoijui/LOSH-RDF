function: "this is my thoughts of those professional-looking cable chains as found at the big industry roboters...\r\n\r\nit's meant to be mounted at the right side of the y-stage (instead of the x-rods end plates).\r\n\r\nunfortunatelly the chain links are a bit too small to fit the x-cables (the ones for the build paltform plus the one to the x-endstop) into :-(\r\nthe 'cabin' thing where the y-moving chains are sliding inside is a bit tight as well...\r\n-- so consider it as a proof of concept only!\r\n\r\nI included all the files needed to build those - just in case anyone want to derive from this - any comments much appreciated!\r\n(don't look too close at the Inventor files - those are real messy right now as I am far from being an Inventor specialist...)"
