    okh:function """this is an OpenScad script that will create Domino tiles for you!\r
\r
you only need to specify the size of each tile, the maximum 'eyes' you want (most common = 6; max. supported by now = 9) and the number of tiles to skip (for bigger sizes that cannot be created in a single run).\r
\r
the main goal of this script is the placement of the domino tiles and calculation of the needed eyes-count on each single tile...\r
the outline of one tile isn't optimal yet - you are very welcome to create better ones (those are the modules one_brick to create the outline and eye to create one single eye at the top of the script).\r
[btw: the small pieces in the first picture are from an earlier/simpler design; I didn't tried the actual design with the small pieces yet]\r
\r
because OpenScad does neither have working variables nor allows recursive module calls, the maximum amount of eyes is '9' (plus: the eye-placement for big counts like 12 or 18 could be messy).""" ;
