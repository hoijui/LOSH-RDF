function: "this is an OpenScad script that will create Domino tiles for you!\r\n\r\nyou only need to specify the size of each tile, the maximum 'eyes' you want (most common = 6; max. supported by now = 9) and the number of tiles to skip (for bigger sizes that cannot be created in a single run).\r\n\r\nthe main goal of this script is the placement of the domino tiles and calculation of the needed eyes-count on each single tile...\r\nthe outline of one tile isn't optimal yet - you are very welcome to create better ones (those are the modules one_brick to create the outline and eye to create one single eye at the top of the script).\r\n[btw: the small pieces in the first picture are from an earlier/simpler design; I didn't tried the actual design with the small pieces yet]\r\n\r\nbecause OpenScad does neither have working variables nor allows recursive module calls, the maximum amount of eyes is '9' (plus: the eye-placement for big counts like 12 or 18 could be messy)."
