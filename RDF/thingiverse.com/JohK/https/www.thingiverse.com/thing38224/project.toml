function = "**UPDATE**: Version 2 of the drinkpond has been out in the wild for quite a while now and I haven't received any complaints whatsoever. If you want to have a drinkpond, you should chose version 2 over version 1.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Version 2 of the drinkpond available now with 5mm higher water level and a cutout to reduce amount of plastic needed and hopefully reduce ABS warping. ATM untested, print at own risk.  \r\n\r\nThis is a cat drinking pond that takes soda bottles (like coke, pepsi, etc) with a pco028 thread as a reservoir. The water level is kept constant without the need for permanent monitoring on your side.  \r\n\r\nAll corners and edges are nicely rounded so your tippy-toe doesn't hurt itself - also it looks much better.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL**** the cat: \"Yay, I can haz water *purr*\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGot inspired by the \"pond for small animals\", my thing is a complete redesign though."
