\r
UPDATE: Version 2 of the drinkpond available now with 5mm higher water level and a cutout to reduce amount of plastic needed and hopefully reduce ABS warping. ATM untested, print at own risk.  \r
\r
This is a cat drinking pond that takes soda bottles (like coke, pepsi, etc) with a pco028 thread as a reservoir. The water level is kept constant without the need for permanent monitoring on your side.  \r
\r
All corners and edges are nicely rounded so your tippy-toe doesn't hurt itself - also it looks much better.  \r

L**** the cat: "Yay, I can haz water *purr*"  \r

Got inspired by the "pond for small animals", my thing is a complete redesign though.""" ;
