function: "Early concept for a fully symmetric belt-driven extruder carriage for upgrading Prusa Mendel. Belt-driven means there's no stepper motor on the X-carriage, so it can be much lighter and move much faster.\r\n\r\nIt has two X-belts that are controlled by one stepper on each side.\r\n\r\nIf both belts move in the same direction, the X-carriage moves in that direction too. If both belts move in opposite directions, the extruder moves but the X-carriage stands still.\r\n\r\nx_motion = (stepper1 + stepper2) / 2\r\nextruder = (stepper1 - stepper2) / 2\r\n\r\nWe'll need new firmware to control x_motion and extruder independently by setting the correct speed for each stepper motor for the two belts.\r\n\r\nstepper1 = x_motion + extruder\r\nstepper2 = x_motion - extruder\r\n\r\nThis design attempts to reduce the effects of the torque that's required to move the extruder:\r\n\r\n* It is based on the excellent VertX (vertical x-axis) by watsdesign with LM8UU linear bearings: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10711\r\n* It uses a pretty large timing belt pulley on the back of the carriage.\r\n* The two belts are entering the carriage very close together and perfectly parallel."
