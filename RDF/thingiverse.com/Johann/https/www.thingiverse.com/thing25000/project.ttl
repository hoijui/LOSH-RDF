\r
This jig is designed to work with plywood pieces of 350x300 mm. You may be able to drill both (top and bottom) at the same time.\r
\r
12 mm (or maybe 9 mm) thick plywood is recommended to make the frame as strong as necessary. 6 mm thin plywood may be okay if your plywood is very good, and you are planning to make a back/side frame anyway, or if you are building a mini Rostock.""" ;
