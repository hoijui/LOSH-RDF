The only pieces needed are 4 new wood panels and 2 smooth rods. \r\n\r\nHow much bigger is it?  The Replicator 1 build volume is 300 cubic inches.  The Replicator 2 is 410 cubic inches.  (Unofficial) Replicator XL?  500 cubic inches (err...498 I think).  \r\n\r\nI also figured if I was in there editing files, I might as well make it look a little more like the Replicator 2, so all of the â€˜windowâ€™ shapes have been changed to reflect the â€˜new look.â€™  \r\n\r\nEnough talk, letâ€™s get to the photos!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jabella/8129250268/in/photostream \r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jabella/8129224609/in/photostream/ \r\n\r\n\r\nThe smooth rods I used are:  http://www.mcmaster.com/#6459K112   (8mm x 400mm)\r\n\r\nBig thanks to Bruce Wattendorf (of Giant Ultimaker fame)  for helping with my meager DXF editing skills.    Thanks also to Dan and Jetty for helping after I spent hours messing with broken firmware."
