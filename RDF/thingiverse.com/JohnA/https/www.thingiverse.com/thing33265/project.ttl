All the Rostock printers made me want to print some taller files - hereâ€™s your chance.  \r
\r
Just for a bit of history on MakerBot Z-axis print heights:\r
\r
- Cupcake CNC: 100mm\r
- Thing-O-Matic: 120mm\r
- Replicator: 150mm\r
- Replicator 2: 155mm\r
\r
And to check in on some competitors:\r
\r
- Printrbot Plus: 203mm\r
- Ultimaker: 220mm\r
- Series 1: 230mm\r
\r
With the swapping of just 6 pieces*, a Replicator 1 can be made into the (Unofficial) Replicator XL - with a Z-axis build area of 250mm.    The only pieces needed are 4 new wood panels and 2 smooth rods. \r
\r
How much bigger is it?  The Replicator 1 build volume is 300 cubic inches.  The Replicator 2 is 410 cubic inches.  (Unofficial) Replicator XL?  500 cubic inches (err...498 I think).  \r
\r
I also figured if I was in there editing files, I might as well make it look a little more like the Replicator 2, so all of the â€˜windowâ€™ shapes have been changed to reflect the â€˜new look.â€™  \r
\r
Enough talk, letâ€™s get to the photos!\r

The smooth rods I used are:  http://www.mcmaster.com/#6459K112   (8mm x 400mm)\r

Big thanks to Bruce Wattendorf (of Giant Ultimaker fame)  for helping with my meager DXF editing skills.    Thanks also to Dan and Jetty for helping after I spent hours messing with broken firmware.""" ;
