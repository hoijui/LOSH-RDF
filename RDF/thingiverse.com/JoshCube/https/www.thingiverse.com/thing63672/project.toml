function = "Replacement ear hook for Samsung Bluetooth ear pieces.  Samsung ships it with a spare hook because they know it will break in 6 months.  Why buy more when you can print them?\r\n\r\nRemixed because:\r\n\r\n1) I needed it.\r\n2) I needed an excuse to make myself learn FreeCad.\r\n\r\nCouldn't figure out how to make a stl file solid for editing in FreeCad, so I just slapped Jinx's model on the virtual workbench and basically traced it.\r\n\r\nWhat's different:\r\n\r\n1) Slightly smoother shape.\r\n2) Rounded off the edges for comfort.\r\n3) Opened the keyway slightly to slip on a little easier.\r\n4) I spent 5 hours remixing what Jinx probably did in 5 minutes."
