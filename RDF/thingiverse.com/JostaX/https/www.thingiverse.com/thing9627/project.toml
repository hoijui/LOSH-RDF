function = "After the fifth time when the from-the-store, cheap plastic hook broke, I designed and made my own. I use it to hang my computer headset under my desk when I an not using it. The hook can be also used as a wire clip, to organize the wires. \r\n\r\nThere are two versions, smaller 20x10mm and 30x15mm. The larger one is the one I am using for my Logitech USB headset. \r\n\r\nThe part is designed using SolidWorks 2011"
