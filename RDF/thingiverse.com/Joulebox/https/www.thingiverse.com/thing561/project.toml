function = "This is a derivative of the monkeybot on thingiverse. I made numerous edits to achieve a snap fit so glue would not be required. I added small sacrificial bumps to the \"fit\" pieces so the fit would be tight. I changed the tail, head and other pieces. I made the cat head version first and as you can see his minions came to his defense. I made a version with fork and spoon for a Paella party we threw this weekend and everyone put together their own forkbot while under the influence of Sangria."
