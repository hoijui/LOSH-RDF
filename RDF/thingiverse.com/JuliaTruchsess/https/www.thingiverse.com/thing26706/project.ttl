    okh:function """The filament feed mechanism in the Up! tends to run hot, which can lead to feed failure when printing PLA, due to "pre-melt" and stripping of the filament. This Thing conducts a jet of cooling air from a compressed air source such as an airbrush compressor into the feed gear chamber, making PLA printing possible. While I've found the cooler to be essential for PLA, I use it all the time now even with ABS because I figure it can't hurt.\r
\r
There are two other Up! feed mechanisms on Thingiverse involving forced air cooling:\r

Drew Peticlerc's \r

\r
and Eurisko84's\r

\r
Unlike those alternative feed mechanisms which are intended primarily to accommodate variations in filament diameter, this Thing simply adds cooling to the stock feed mechanism.\r
