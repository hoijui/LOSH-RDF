function: "The filament feed mechanism in the Up! tends to run hot, which can lead to feed failure when printing PLA, due to \"pre-melt\" and stripping of the filament. This Thing conducts a jet of cooling air from a compressed air source such as an airbrush compressor into the feed gear chamber, making PLA printing possible. While I've found the cooler to be essential for PLA, I use it all the time now even with ABS because I figure it can't hurt.\r\n\r\nThere are two other Up! feed mechanisms on Thingiverse involving forced air cooling:\r\n\r\nDrew Peticlerc's \r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16712\r\n\r\nand Eurisko84's\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18010\r\n\r\nUnlike those alternative feed mechanisms which are intended primarily to accommodate variations in filament diameter, this Thing simply adds cooling to the stock feed mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis Thing was created with TinkerCAD; you can edit it yourself here: https://tinkercad.com/things/2Y4tHjY0eE1-bolt-on-feed-gear-cooler-for-up-start-plus"
