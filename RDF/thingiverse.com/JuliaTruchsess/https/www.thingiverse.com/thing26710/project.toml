function = "Having gone through a nasty nozzle clog or two I don't want to ever have to repeat the experience if I can help it. This Thing helps reduce the probability of a clog due to dust etc. by passing the filament through a small chunk of open-cell foam. The foam is held inside the Thing so that you don't have to deal with a loose piece of foam every time you change filament.\r\n\r\nRather than offset the guide to the spool's edge as is often done, I designed this guide to mount on the spool's centerline and pivot in a self-adjusting way to the amount of filament on the spool.\r\n\r\nThis Thing also provides air connections for feed mechanism forced-air cooling schemes such as this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26706\r\n\r\ngiving you a stable anchor point for the air feed hose and allowing you to disconnect the compressor hose without disconnecting the hose that feeds the extruder head.\r\n\r\nThis Thing was created with TinkerCAD, you can edit it for your own purposes here: https://tinkercad.com/things/7TdiCS8fsuQ-filament-guide-head and here: https://tinkercad.com/things/0FKbVaAoFds-filament-guide-bracket."
