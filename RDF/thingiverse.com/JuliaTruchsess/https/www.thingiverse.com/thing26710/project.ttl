    okh:function """Having gone through a nasty nozzle clog or two I don't want to ever have to repeat the experience if I can help it. This Thing helps reduce the probability of a clog due to dust etc. by passing the filament through a small chunk of open-cell foam. The foam is held inside the Thing so that you don't have to deal with a loose piece of foam every time you change filament.\r
\r
Rather than offset the guide to the spool's edge as is often done, I designed this guide to mount on the spool's centerline and pivot in a self-adjusting way to the amount of filament on the spool.\r
\r
This Thing also provides air connections for feed mechanism forced-air cooling schemes such as this:\r

giving you a stable anchor point for the air feed hose and allowing you to disconnect the compressor hose without disconnecting the hose that feeds the extruder head.\r
