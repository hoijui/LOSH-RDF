function: "I recently purchased a M350 Universal Mini-ITX enclosure to hold a compact workstation for 3D rendering purposes.  As I am tight for space, the case had to be as small as possible and preferably mount to my 19' widescreen monitor.  \r\n\r\nThe M350 seemed to fit the bill, but it was only after I purchased it that I thought to check the mounting holes on my monitor... Doh, there is more than one VESA standard and my monitor and case did not match.\r\n\r\nSo I have created a printable adaptor that is as parametric as I can make it.  As well as having variables for the key attributes you may need to change such as mounting hole sizes and the height of the adaptor, their are also 3 different styles of mounting plate you can generate using the scad file.\r\n\r\n1.  Cross.  The mounts are held in place by two crossed beams\r\n\r\n2.  Outer Ring.  The mounts are contained within a ring which has optional oval cut-outs\r\n\r\n3.  Full Strength.  (Photos) This has both the outer ring and internal cross members for full support.  I am no engineer, but I am pretty sure this is the strongest option of the three.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option to switch between generating the mounting plate and a much smaller calibration piece.\r\n\r\nAlthough designed to mount an ITX case to a VESA75 equiped monitor, I am sure that this design can be used for other purposes as well.  Hence the amount of adjustment possible via Openscad.  \r\n\r\nI printed mine in PLA and it seems strong enough to hold my ITX case and electronics."
