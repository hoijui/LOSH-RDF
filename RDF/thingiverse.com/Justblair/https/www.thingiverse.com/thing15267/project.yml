function: "This is my torch holder.  I designed it to compliment my Parametric Battery Dispenser (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15149) and it mounts to the inside of a cupboard door for convenient access. \r\n\r\nThe design is sized to fit a LED Lenser M7 Torch but is highly parametric so can be used with just about any torch.  I am sure that it could be used to hold many other tools as well.\r\n\r\nI designed it to use double sided sticky foam to attach to the inside of a cupboard door but I have also included options that create mounting holes either horizontally or vertically.  This as well as the mounting plate being fully parametric (You can choose between two corner styles as well), means I am confident that the design will suit many tastes.\r\n\r\nThe clasp part of the holder is also parametric so you can choose a thickness and also opening size that suits your materials and printer capabilities.  The default values work well printed in PLA at 35% infill, 3 skins.  This seems to be flexible enough that the torch can be pulled through the clasp without damaging the finish of the torch or stressing the plastic.  YMMV\r\n\r\nIn the pipeline are a host of other door mounting fittings, I intend to organise all my most often used tools in this manner."
