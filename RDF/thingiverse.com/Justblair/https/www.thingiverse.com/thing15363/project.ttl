I am growing to love OpenSCAD as a creative tool for 3D design but I do find that it's text editor lacks many of the basic features that I appreciate when writing code... Namely:\r
\r
Auto-Completion\r
Syntax Highlighting\r
Collapsible Outline levels\r
Line Numbering\r
Automatic Tabbing\r
Search and Replace\r
Block Tabbing using the tab key.\r
\r
I was pleased to discover however that you don't need to put up with the standard text editor.  There is a feature that allows you to conveniently use the text editor of your choice with OpenSCAD.  My editor of choice is Notepad++ a fast well featured open source text editor.  You can download it from http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ \r
\r
Notepad++ supports many different programming languages but not unfortunately OpenSCAD.  It does however have the facility that allows you to create your own language file which I have included here.\r
\r
This is definitely a work in progress as I have had to make a few compromises due to the limitations of Notepad++'s language editor.  I dare say other more experienced coders opinions will differ as to how best to syntax code the OpenSCAD language.\r
\r
I am currently working on adding auto-complete functionality to notepad++ as we speak.  I have included a working though not complete file called openscad_removethisbitandcopy.xml.  Currently most if not all functions will auto-complete, what is going to take me longer is adding call-tips to all the functions which would be nice though is not critical.\r
\r
**** Edits *****\r
13/5/2012  Added extension type to openscad.xml so that Notepad++ will now automatically detect language when .scad files are opened.  Thankyou CrazyJaw, saved me some time there.""" ;
