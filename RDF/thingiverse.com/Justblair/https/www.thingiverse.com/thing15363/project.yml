function: "This guide is for Windows Users.\r\n\r\nI am growing to love OpenSCAD as a creative tool for 3D design but I do find that it's text editor lacks many of the basic features that I appreciate when writing code... Namely:\r\n\r\nAuto-Completion\r\nSyntax Highlighting\r\nCollapsible Outline levels\r\nLine Numbering\r\nAutomatic Tabbing\r\nSearch and Replace\r\nBlock Tabbing using the tab key.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to discover however that you don't need to put up with the standard text editor.  There is a feature that allows you to conveniently use the text editor of your choice with OpenSCAD.  My editor of choice is Notepad++ a fast well featured open source text editor.  You can download it from http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ \r\n\r\nNotepad++ supports many different programming languages but not unfortunately OpenSCAD.  It does however have the facility that allows you to create your own language file which I have included here.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a work in progress as I have had to make a few compromises due to the limitations of Notepad++'s language editor.  I dare say other more experienced coders opinions will differ as to how best to syntax code the OpenSCAD language.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on adding auto-complete functionality to notepad++ as we speak.  I have included a working though not complete file called openscad_removethisbitandcopy.xml.  Currently most if not all functions will auto-complete, what is going to take me longer is adding call-tips to all the functions which would be nice though is not critical.\r\n\r\n**** Edits *****\r\n13/5/2012  Added extension type to openscad.xml so that Notepad++ will now automatically detect language when .scad files are opened.  Thankyou CrazyJaw, saved me some time there."
