I had planned on producing a torsion box for my Y-Axis motor since seeing Lanthans example(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11017).  However I realised that using the much more compact synchromesh cable pulleys left plenty of stepper motor axle.  So I created a torsion box that instead of holding a pulley within a bearing, grips the 5mm axle directly.  As the 5mm axles are machined to very low tolerances, I can achieve very precise constraint on the stepper motor axle.\r\n\r\nThe design uses the 695ZZ miniature bearing a readily available item from ebay, but as the scad file is parametric you can of course alter the bearing trap to suit what you have available.  \r\n\r\nThis design is a derivative of Spacexula's Y Bracket, which in turn is a derivative of Prusa's I believe.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to, you can also print a reverse bearing trap which is designed to constrain the motor axle at the other end for motor designs that allow this.\r\n\r\nI also included options in the scad file to print a calibration piece so that you can fine tune your hole sizes to achieve good tolerances.\r\n\r\nI made a short recording of the mount in action... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdSNRCEeU64"
