function: "I recently replaced the 5mm timing cables for the X and Y axis on my Reprap Prusa with SynchroMesh Cable.\r\n(https://sdp-si.com/eStore/PartDetail.asp?Opener=Group&PartID=84751&GroupID=768)\r\n\r\nI used the pulleys (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15923) shared by Granz initially with a 15 tooth pulley.  \r\n\r\nLooking at the pulley in situ it was very obvious to me that it is very much more compact than your average 5mm belt pulley.  \r\n\r\nA plan was hatched.  I had planned on producing a torsion box for my Y-Axis motor since seeing Lanthans example(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11017).  However I realised that using the much more compact synchromesh cable pulleys left plenty of stepper motor axle.  So I created a torsion box that instead of holding a pulley within a bearing, grips the 5mm axle directly.  As the 5mm axles are machined to very low tolerances, I can achieve very precise constraint on the stepper motor axle.\r\n\r\nThe design uses the 695ZZ miniature bearing a readily available item from ebay, but as the scad file is parametric you can of course alter the bearing trap to suit what you have available.  \r\n\r\nThis design is a derivative of Spacexula's Y Bracket, which in turn is a derivative of Prusa's I believe.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to, you can also print a reverse bearing trap which is designed to constrain the motor axle at the other end for motor designs that allow this.\r\n\r\nI also included options in the scad file to print a calibration piece so that you can fine tune your hole sizes to achieve good tolerances.\r\n\r\nI made a short recording of the mount in action... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdSNRCEeU64"
