function: "This is a part that I altered from the Reprap Prusa so that I could use it for a special varient that we are building on the 19th and 20th of October at Glasgow Sculpture Studio.\r\n\r\nThe build is on webcam at http://bambuser.com/v/3073509 for just now.  We will be releasing final plans for the printer over the next few days, but get your metalwork gear out as that is a welded steel printer."
