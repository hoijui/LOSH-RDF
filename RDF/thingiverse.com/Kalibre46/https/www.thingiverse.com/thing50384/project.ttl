\r
The Space Navigator 3D mouse by 3DConnexion is a great bit of kit and has a lovely bright blue LED ring in the base. What isn't so lovely is trying to get to sleep with that bright blue LED ring in the same room if you happen to have it in a bedroom and leave your PC/Mac switched on overnight.\r
\r
To get around this issue I created a nice little hat for it. It also contains a little notch for the cable to go through.""" ;
