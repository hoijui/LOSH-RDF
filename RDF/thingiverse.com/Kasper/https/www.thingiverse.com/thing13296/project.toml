function = "I found the basic design for this King Leonidas shield on Google's 3D Warehouse but can't for the life of me find it again to give credit.  It still needs to be tweaked a bit to get the fill I'd like to make it more solid yet still have some detail.  Feel free to play with it and repost your variations.  \r\n\r\nI'd like to start a catalog of all things Spartans, preferably form the Battle Of Thermopylae and the movie 300."
