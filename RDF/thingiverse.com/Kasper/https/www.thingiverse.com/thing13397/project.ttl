    okh:function "This is a mash-up of sorts of a generic trophy I found on Google 3D Warehouse and RossThomson's Basketball (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3403).  I printed the ball in 2 halves, glued together, & placed on top of the trophy.  The trophy itself is a bit flimsy since I chose not to infill, will try again.  Also you'll notice if you load the file that mine is only printed up to the last 10% or so...that's because the extruder knocked the print over towards the end so I stopped it there and cut away the filament-gone-wild.  Next time a bigger raft is in order as well." ;
