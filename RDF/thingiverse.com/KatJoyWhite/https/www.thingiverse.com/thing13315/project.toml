function = "A button - for clothes! (not for dropping cubes on to open doors)\r\n\r\nThere are 2 parts so that you can either create a traditional button with 2 holes and one colour, or you can make a multi-colour button with no holes visible on top. The top is designed to be slightly smaller than the recess in the bottom so you can cover it in some sort of material for a fabric-centre button. (Or you can cover the whole button in fabric, which is what I've done so far)."
