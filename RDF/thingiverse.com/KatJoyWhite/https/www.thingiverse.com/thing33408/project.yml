function: "I dressed up as Miss Scarlet from Cluedo (The boardgame 'Clue' for the Americans) for a recent Halloween party. I has a red dress and a bloodied candlestick and finished it off with this last clue - a pendant made in the shape of the room blueprints from the room cards. \r\n\r\nI made the dining room and the ballroom because my friend came with me as Prof Plum."
