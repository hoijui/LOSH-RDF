function = "This is a shower ring that's based off of one we had in our shower. I made this in FreeCAD and printed it on my RepRap.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Even though I have this connected to a master link and then another shower ring, this piece has enough flexibilty to be put directly on the shower rod and still clamp shut. I printed it at 30% infill."
