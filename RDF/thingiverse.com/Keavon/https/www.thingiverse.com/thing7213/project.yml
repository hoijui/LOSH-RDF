function: "If you ever tried to print the whistle with the ball in the middle (which is not entirely necessary) but were unable to get the roof to print right, then this is the solution.  \n\nI just turned the ball into a center column which allows for easier gap bridging.  \n\nThis is a derivative work of Whistle by Zaggo, thing #1046. I can't seem to be able to find out how to officially link them."
