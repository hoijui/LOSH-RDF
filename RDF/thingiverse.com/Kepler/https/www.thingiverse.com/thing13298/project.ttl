    okh:function """This is a fully printable mobile robot I designed and built last year. However, it wasn't very useful until JuliÃ¡n MarÃxadn Mato added some electronics and wrote some code to control it with a gamepad. Now that we can say it's finally 100% functional, we'd love you to play around with one too!\r

There are, of course, things to be improved: using more powerful servos, strengthening some parts, adding wireless comms, etc. All that will come in the (near?) future.""" ;
