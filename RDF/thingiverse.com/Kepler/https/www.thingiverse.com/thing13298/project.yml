function: "This is a fully printable mobile robot I designed and built last year. However, it wasn't very useful until Juli\xC3\xA1n Mar\xC3\xADn Mato added some electronics and wrote some code to control it with a gamepad. Now that we can say it's finally 100% functional, we'd love you to play around with one too!\r\n\r\nTo see it in action, check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54MXA22bOmQ\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, things to be improved: using more powerful servos, strengthening some parts, adding wireless comms, etc. All that will come in the (near?) future."
