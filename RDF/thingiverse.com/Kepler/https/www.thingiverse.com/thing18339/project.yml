function: "This is a small robotic claw designed to pick up a can of Red Bull Shot. It was really an exercise to make the simplest possible mechanism that would get the job done, with the least number of parts and as small as possible. It works quite well, even though the pincers could do with a little bit more friction for a better grip (add rubber bands?)\r\n\r\nCheck it out at: http://youtu.be/IM5oRUVfCBY"
