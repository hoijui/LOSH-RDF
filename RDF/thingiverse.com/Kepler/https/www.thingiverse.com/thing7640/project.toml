function = "This caterpillar track is the first step towards designing and building a printable mobile robot. My finished robot will have four of these modules, but many other designs are possible. A single caterpillar can function on its own as a simple robot that can move forwards and backwards; two modules can be joined together to form a tank-like machine, etc.\r\n\r\nThis thing is designed to work with a Futaba 3003 servo (modified for continuous rotation) and uses O-rings to make up the transmission and the caterpillar itself.\r\n\r\nTransmission O-ring: 3mm thickness, 60mm diameter\r\nCaterpillar O-rings: 3mm thickness, 124mm diameter\r\n\r\nThis O-ring system was chosen because it was easier to prototype, but it has evident drawbacks. In future revisions I will change it to a \"solid\" rubber track.\r\n\r\nNote that the pictures of the printed robot at the bottom of the page are missing the reinforcement parts. I will upload new pictures as soon as I modify it!\r\n\r\nVideo of the robot in action!!\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efXHjjU-yYg (Simple test)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVgXtljqaAQ (Highest inclination: 36รยบ)\r\n\r\nUpdate! (17/4/2011)\r\nUploaded an HD artistic rendition of the UniTrack created by my brother Hasier Goitia. Expect more images and videos after the Easter Break!"
