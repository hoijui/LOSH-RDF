function: "At my university we have a Makerbot Thing-O-Matic which has been aptly named \"Madre\" (\"Mother\", in spanish) because it will print the necessary parts to build a second generation of 3D printers (several Prusa-Mendel printers).  \n\nI decided to create a small sign that we could place on the printer. I printed the letters separately from the background, in different colors. The background has the shape of the letters indented so that they can be fitted inside. I was amazed by how well it turned out!"
