    okh:function """My wife and I use an electric toothbrush. Rather than leave the brush heads lying on the vanity top, I thought it would be nice to have a little stand for them. This model supports up to three heads and has been tested with Oral-B brush heads. It should fit other brands.\r
This is the first thing I have published, and I hope you enjoy using it. It might be better to break up the model into 3 separate pieces and glue them together, but it worked fine enough as is.\r
I have uploaded version 2. I added a place at the bottom that will collect water that may drip from the heads, and I also put a decorative sunrise on the back.""" ;
