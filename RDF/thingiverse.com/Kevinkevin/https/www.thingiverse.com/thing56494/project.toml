function = "This is an iPhone 5 case based off of the \"Slim iPhone 5 Snap-On Case\".  I added a pattern of squash racquet silhouettes.  Perfect for fans of the (hopefully) Olympic sport.  I've uploaded the SketchUp file as well, I personalized mine further by setting my name in the side of the case."
