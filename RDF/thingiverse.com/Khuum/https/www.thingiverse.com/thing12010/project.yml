function: "This is my Makerbot Mascot that I made for a school project (year 10) I think the overall design is good, apart from it may not be printable. \r\n\r\nThis is the fastest robot in the world, it gave up it arms to increase it's leg power and therefore makes it faster. it's ears aerent only there for fashion but it is there for super speed. it unleashes fire out of it and makes it faster."
