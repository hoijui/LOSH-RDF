function: The Y belt on the Orca is terribly difficult to tension, you have to get underneath the build platform and carefully adjust the belt by pulling it in, and even at that, its still very difficult to do. This is a replacement for one (or both if you so desire) for the end pulleys. This is actually the first iteration of the design, it worked well, and I don't think it really needs any changing.
