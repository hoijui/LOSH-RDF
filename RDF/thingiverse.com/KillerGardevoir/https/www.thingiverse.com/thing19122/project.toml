function = "Its an adjustable variation of the Heavy Duty printable filament holder.  I was preturbed at close the filament spool had to be to fitting exactly on the hooks, any smaller or larger than the small or large settings made it impossible to put a medium sized spool of PLA (PLA is VERY springy and doesn't like taking on new shapes) on it, I liked the design, but thought it could use a rework."
