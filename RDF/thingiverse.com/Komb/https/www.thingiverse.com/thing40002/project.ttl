Beefed-up Fan mount and added nut traps to it.  

Ducted Fan add-on - Thing: 899166  

12-05-2014   
Added new idler that works with non Eckertech hobbed bolts. May help with 1.75mm. Included modified .scad file so you can adjust as needed.  

I like the Ecsktruder better than the Gregs, Wades, hinged, .....  

But attaching it to the Wallace required some cutting and an extender for the smaller J-heads.  

So, I melded the Extender to the Ecsktruder Base.  

Now it's one print and the filament has less distance to travel.  

Note: The extender edge is slightly off the bed. The print worked for me, but your milage may vary. If soemone can help me get the plate side verticies lined-up, I'd apreciate it.  

UPDATE: Now with a grove for easier wire placement. Sorry, still not fixed the other problem.  

UPDATE 2: Moved the HotEnd mounting holes down! Now all the vents on the small J-Heads are exposed and there is more clearance below the X-Carriage. Fixed 90% of the printing problem!  
Also enlarged the hot-end opending. Still snug but much better.  

UPDATE 3: Now with recesses for the hot-end screws!""" ;
