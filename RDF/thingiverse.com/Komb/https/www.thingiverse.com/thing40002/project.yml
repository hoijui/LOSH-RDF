function: "Note: Designed for 3mm Filament  \n\n07-03-2015   \nBeefed-up Fan mount and added nut traps to it.  \n\nDucted Fan add-on - Thing: 899166  \n\n12-05-2014   \nAdded new idler that works with non Eckertech hobbed bolts. May help with 1.75mm. Included modified .scad file so you can adjust as needed.  \n\nI like the Ecsktruder better than the Gregs, Wades, hinged, .....  \n\nBut attaching it to the Wallace required some cutting and an extender for the smaller J-heads.  \n\nSo, I melded the Extender to the Ecsktruder Base.  \n\nNow it's one print and the filament has less distance to travel.  \n\nNote: The extender edge is slightly off the bed. The print worked for me, but your milage may vary. If soemone can help me get the plate side verticies lined-up, I'd apreciate it.  \n\nUPDATE: Now with a grove for easier wire placement. Sorry, still not fixed the other problem.  \n\nUPDATE 2: Moved the HotEnd mounting holes down! Now all the vents on the small J-Heads are exposed and there is more clearance below the X-Carriage. Fixed 90% of the printing problem!  \nAlso enlarged the hot-end opending. Still snug but much better.  \n\nUPDATE 3: Now with recesses for the hot-end screws!"
