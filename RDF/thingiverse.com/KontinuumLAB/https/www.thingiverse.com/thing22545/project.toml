function = "The Kontinuum Garden is a highly automated, rotating hydroponic system, designed to be almost entirely 3d-printed.\r\n\r\nIt's a true food-factory. Extremely water and energy efficient, and equipped with a simple DIY LED-growlight, and a 3D-printed pump system. The capacity will be for 60 plants.\r\n\r\nWe are making the Garden because we want to change the way people think about food.\r\nWe want to use 3d-printer technology to make sustainable automated food-production available for all people, everywhere.\r\n\r\nOur hope is that the garden will help people around the world be more independent and grow their own food.\r\n\r\nWe are also building the printer which will make this. \r\nThe \"Kontinuum Reprap\" is our design for a reprap with a print area of roughly 1 meter squared, allowing it to print one garden in only 4 prints.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are funding the development of the Kontinuum Garden and Kontinuum Reprap on Indiegogo.com/Kontinuumgarden\r\nPlease go check it out."
