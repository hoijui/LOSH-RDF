function = "This is a simple case for a flash drive.  It is meant to be a replacement for the original plastic housing for the circuit board.  I had a few lying around that were bare and could do with some durability.  I made it to be the right size for most flash drive boards.  The internal size fits a board of 2 inches by 5/8 and is 3/16 thick.  It can be shortened after printing or before.  I used solidworks and included the file.  I designed it with the intent to print it, but i guess it could be milled also.  \r\n\r\nI have not made this as my printer is not yet fully assembled, and I am new to making printable things.  Please let me know if there is something wrong that prevents it from printing."
