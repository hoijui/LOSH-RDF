function: "In the spirit of Rahsaan Roland Kirk, we designed a mouthpiece for the Anarchestra that was supposed to play 2 instruments at the same time.  Then we printed a prototype on a 3D printer in ABS plastic, and attached it to 2 homemade musical instruments.  However, the experiment did not work.  We could only get sound from one, but not both, of the instruments (from the pipe with the hole closest to the mouthpiece).\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could get the mouthpiece to work by tweaking the design.  Specifically, we might add a separator in the middle -- between the arc and the reed holder -- in the throat of the dual mouthpiece.  That separator might be as thin as a razor blade, and would be added lengthwise (parallel with the blowing air, in order to avoid creating additional turbulence).  Perhaps the 2 resulting new chambers in the throat cylinder would also have to be enlarged, for acoustical reasons.\r\n\r\n(If one could print the dual mouthpiece in glass (or maybe see-thru plastic), he might blow smoke through the transparent dual mouthpiece to see the turbulence, and then redefine the design to get rid of that turbulence)\r\n\r\nThere are other flaws in the design:\r\n\r\n*  The slope of the reed holder needs to be adjusted so that the reed fits snugly on the dual mouthpiece, without leaving a gap. \r\n\r\n*  The housing of the reed holder section needs a slight bulge around its circumference, so that the metal reed holders can slip over the mouthpiece housing, and securely hold the reed to the mouthpiece.\r\n\r\n*  Also the tip of the mouthpiece needs to be rounded slightly, whereas in our design the tip is straight.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone is welcome to download the file and improve the design.\r\n\r\n\r\nRahsaan Roland Kirk:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVU34lV3fVc#t=00m22s\r\n\r\nAnarchestra:  http://www.anarchestra.net/index2.php\r\n\r\nMore creations on my Posterous blog:  http://krrrl.posterous.com/"
