function = "Tri-Track robot chassis is based on Sublime 100mm wheel base track system.  This design incorporates dual servo motors that are mounted above the chassis.  This design allows for mounting a robot body or arm between the tracks. The battery pack and electronics will be moved as the design progresses.\r\nFrame has been significantly strengthened to accommodate for the added stresses and to increase weight capacity.\r\n\r\n UPDATE \r\n\r\n12-20-11\r\nAdded platform base for mounting robot body or arm.\r\n\r\n12/21-11 Added additional files\r\n\r\n1-08-12\r\nRendered BaseLeft and BaseRight in two pieces, this enables them to be printed on a MakerBot. The two piece files are: BaseleftP1, BaseleftP2, BaserightP1, BaserightP2\r\n\r\nThere are errors in the Tri-Track Frame file.  This fils is still printable.  We are working on correcting errors.\r\n\r\n1-12-12\r\nRedesigned and added New Tri-Track Frame for Solid Axle construction. File Name: Tri-Track Frame For Solid Axle v1\r\n\r\nShort video of Tri-Track in motion:\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/KcNyt-GK2NU\r\n\r\nMy plan is to build a two armed robot around this motorized platform.\r\n\r\n CREDIT \r\n\r\nOriginal Track design by Olalla\r\nSee http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8559\r\n\r\nServo Mount is by Hoeken.  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5165 This is printed horizontally for strength."
