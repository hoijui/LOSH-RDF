function = "A customizable filiment odometer.\r\nChoose the number of digits you would like displayed and the units (cm and inches).\r\nAlso because I'm a nerd feel free to express your values in either Decimal, Oct, or Hex (no binary at this point but if there is desire for it let me know and I'll design custom gears to replace the Decimal option)\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not have a functioning printer so this is very much a work in progress, let me know if there are any problems with printing or the mechanism and I will do my best to resolve them.\r\n\r\nDesign inspired by ErikJDurwoodII but this is very much a seperate project to his work"
