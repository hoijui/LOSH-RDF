function: "Printed Paint roll to customize your tapestry. \r\nThis hacking project was made in collaboration with ADEO a group that owns many tool brands such as Dexter. We brainstormed as a team and came up with many funny ideas to hack products selected among a thick catalogue.\r\n\r\nI got to work on printed accessories for standard 120mm paint rolls."
