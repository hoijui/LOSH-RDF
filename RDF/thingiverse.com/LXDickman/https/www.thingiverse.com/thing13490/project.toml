function = "A threeway 60 degree pipe joint for 1/2 inch schedule 40 pvc pipe.  4 of these should make an Isosceles pyramid, or a PVC TeePee.  I'm really hoping somebody takes this idea and makes it better.  And other variants could produce scaffolding, or a really big tinkertoys set.  Break out of the 90 and 45 degree rut the Hardware store imposes on you."
