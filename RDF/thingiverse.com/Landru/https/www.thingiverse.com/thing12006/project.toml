function = "This is an adequately close model of Magneto/Shaw's helmet from x-men first class. Total print time is about 25hrs.   \nDesigned for a 7.5\" head width. In hindsight it is a bit too big, and I would scale it by 7/7.5 if I were doing it again.  \nThe first one was printed on a Fablicator.  \nwww.fablicator.com"
