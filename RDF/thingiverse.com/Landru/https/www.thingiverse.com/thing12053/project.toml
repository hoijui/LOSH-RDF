function = "This is a spring designed for 3d printing. \r\n\r\nWatch the video to see it in action!\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxwbQSMbEIA\r\n\r\nThe more you scale the spring, the smaller the spring constant. \r\n\r\nIncreasing your filament width increases the spring constant. \r\n\r\nThe spring can be used in tension or compression, but it must be fairly short with comparatively thick filament width to be used in compression. \r\n\r\nIt can be made extremely flexible and it is very fun to play with. \r\n\r\nIt's form was discovered by accident, as it was originally auto generated support for the middle of a hollow cylinder. \r\n\r\nI'm still perfecting the design but it works quite well in it's current state. \r\n\r\nI will be uploading different sizes (and source files shortly) over the next few days. \r\n\r\nThe spring was prototyped on a Fablicator.\r\nwww.Fablicator.com"
