function = "This is an exactly proportional copy of the companion cube from portal, as traced from a screenshot. \r\n\r\nThere were a few cubes already on thingiverse which I've printed out dozens of, but they all had some issues with printability or proportionality. I think I've solved all the problems with this version. \r\n\r\nThis version is flat bottomed, and has no significant overhangs over 45 degrees.  \r\n\r\nIt is carefully designed in Solidworks so any changes can be quickly and easily made. I also included step files since Solidworks is pretty unfriendly to a lot of other programs. \r\n\r\nThe default size is exactly 1in^3\r\n\r\nThe Cube in the thumbnail was printed by a Fablicator. \r\nwww.Fablicator.com"
