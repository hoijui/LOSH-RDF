function: "I've been looking for one of these a long time, but was unable to find a printable model anywhere. I finally gave in and heavily modified the terminator skull found at: http://grabcad.com/library/terminator-head   \n\nand made it a single, solid mesh, learning how to use blender in the process.   \n\n\n\nBe aware, printing one of these on a self replicating printer may be a really bad idea. Hopefully the end of the world isn't open sourced ;)  \n\n\n\nThe original was printed on a Fablicator.  www.Fablicator.com"
