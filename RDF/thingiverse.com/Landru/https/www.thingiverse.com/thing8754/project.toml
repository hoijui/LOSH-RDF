function = "NEW! as of June 17.\r\n\r\nThis is now a complete modular rocket system!\r\n\r\nPick a nosecone, body tube(s), fincan, nosecone coupler, and voila! A semi custom printable rocket!\r\n\r\nI plan to be adding new sections on a regular basis so check back often! Feel free to leave feedback if there is some feature you'd like to see that isn't up yet :)\r\n\r\nImportant dimensions to make compatible modules:\r\nTube Outside Diameter - 1.75in\r\nTube Inside Diameter -  1.667in\r\nCoupler Tube Outside Diameter (tight): 1.663in\r\nCoupler Tube Outside diameter (looser): 1.659in\r\n\r\nNOTE: The designs are closely based on the Legacy design and should work well, but many of them are still untested. I'm working on it, though."
