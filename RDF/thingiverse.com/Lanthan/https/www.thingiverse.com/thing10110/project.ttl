    okh:function """I have built a custom sliced wade's extruder (more on this later) that can develop quite some pressure. Since I do not have a lathe, I dremelled the bolt (M8x8) using the method described by Elk http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9291. This initially worked well, but I was confronted with early failure of the bolt (see picture) and I wasn't quite satisfied with the precision obtained with that method (picture), so I built this small indexer. This is to be manually rotated after each hobbing cycle. \r
An obvious further development would be adding a stepper (a quick release coupler, anyone?) but I'd need to care about changing the parallel port interface or configuring emc-arduino.""" ;
