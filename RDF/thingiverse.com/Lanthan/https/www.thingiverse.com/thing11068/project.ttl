There is ancestry for this thing in Thingiverse, as a case for including a drilled out and tapped M5 nut to secure a pulley on a motor shaft has already been published. Cannot happen to find that design right now.\r
\r
* This method addresses concerns of slippage along smooth rods: the trapped nuts on the idler and motor ends of some of the Mendel x-end designs are held by very few layers of plastic. This drastically limits the pressure one can appply to fix in place the smooth rods. Symptoms might include the need to frequently adjust / re-tension the x axis belt. Some designs address this by closing the rod channel ends, but rod length may then be an issue. \r
\r
Alternative solutions dealing with plastic:  to significantly increase the number of layers under the trapped nuts; a printed collar piece like http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2454 (but less pressure can be applied with that one); bolted brackets (like Selis Mendel), closing out the ends of the rods channels (but rod length issues may arise then); commercial shaft collars (expensive!), etc.\r
\r
* This low cost solution will allow you to tighten and secure the smooth rods with significant pressure. To secure a Prusa Mendel's X rods you'll need to prepare 4 of those. Can come handy in many other situations. \r
\r
Note: I drilled them at 180 degrees for expediency, but have learned since then that the optimal solution would be 90 degrees between the screws. drilling the center of faces 120 degrees apart might be an acceptable compromise.""" ;
