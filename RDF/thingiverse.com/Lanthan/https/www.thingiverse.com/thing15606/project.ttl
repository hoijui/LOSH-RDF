Selis Mendel features a plywood or acrylic plate there, Prusa Mendel has nothing. I am too lazy to cut plywood right now, so here it is. \r
\r
Inspired by Lateral support for Prusa by Miro87043 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14606 , this solution is, I believe, more comprehensive with a full triangulation, while staying out of the way and keeping the filament needs reasonable: about 40 grams for both side pieces, and 28.5 grams for the top assembly.\r
\r
This part has been thought as an unobtrusive upgrade: no need to dismantle your pyramid amid much fear and loathing, the thing has brackets to bolt it over the existing studding. This comes at the cost of slightly more filament and just a few bolts.\r
\r
The top part has some residual flexibility along the X axis. This might help with dampening, or not. Alternatively the part can be printed as a box, or massive by editing the dxf and re-exporting the stl from openscad. The code is a huge mess, in a big need of cleanup and parametrization.\r
\r
Update 20120109: Thanks to http://www.thingiverse.com/Justblair 's excellent work, a finalized version has been uploaded (all.stl and the openscad revised files).""" ;
