The fit is quite close, and with some Teflon spray they appear to work great!\r\nThis has still to be mounted and tested. Notice the tidy desk ;-)\r\n\r\nOther available sources are Makerblock's build http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16384 \r\n\r\nJohnA's gondola:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12557"
