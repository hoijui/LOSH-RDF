It was a fairly involved process, since the closest material I could find is 6.7 mm thick beech plywood: so I adapted the thickness of the slots and similar. I also introduced some small mods, documented in the pictures. By order of perceived usefulness:\r
\r
* Brass bushings scavenged from discarded printers (my preferences go to Epson, the older, the better). X and Y holes for bars adapted consequently. Y axis is 8 mm brass rod (brass on brass = smooth as silk, we'll see how long it lasts), X axis bars are 9.5 mm chromed and polished printer carriage bars. Bushings are press-fit, after good alignment I put a couple of drops of  cyanacrylate glue on the perimeter, then a layer of epoxy-metal.\r
* Added M3 threaded bar right under the bushings, allows to better adjust alignment of the bushings to the bars, a good adjustment significantly reduces friction.\r
* Added rubber feet to the bot (from another discarded printer)\r
* Added 10 mm height to the lower compartment since I am having issues with placing my power supply because of the increased thickness of the panels, and reversed the cutouts and drill holes in the power panel. (notice this is only in the plans)\r
\r
Notice that I am using the Z stage adapted for the ACME screws http://abella.net/?page_id=306\r
\r
As the build goes on, I am quite happy with the results of the cut. \r
\r
IMHO the dxf files could still be improved. Because of tool size correction, I could not use the 1/8 cutter directly - emc2 barfs at the 1.5 mm radius cuts when informed the cutter diameter is 3.1 mm\r
\r
Update 20101020: While mounting the X carriage to the body, I discovered that the clearance to the bottom is insufficient (this is due to the increased thickness of the plywood), so I shaved off 1 mm in the X_left_right and in the X_rib dxfs. I replaced these files in the uploaded set.""" ;
