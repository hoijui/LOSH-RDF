function = "This is jjshortcut's mini servo gripper (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2415) routerized and adapted for 6.7 mm plywood. I am using a 1.5 mm spiral cutter in 1 mm passes.\r\nIt appears to work great mechanically speaking (now need to make that servo shield....). Be sure to get metal gear mini servos instead of plastic geared ones, those are way too easy to destroy.\r\n\r\nNote: A further iteration of the design with improved gears can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5034"
