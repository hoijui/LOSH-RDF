function: "This one might help with those oh so lovely soldering fumes getting in your eyes nose and lungs. There are some quick instructables ( see for example http://www.raphnet.net/divers/fume_extractor/index_en.php or  http://www.instructables.com/id/Solder-Fume-Extractor/ ) dealing with the same question, but I was aiming for a more durable solution.\r\n\r\nI used 6.7 mm plywood, a salvaged computer fan (ths particular Antec one measures 91.6 mm ). It features a three speed selector, but I doubt I will use it with anything less than the HI setting.\r\nThe 12V power supply is recycled from an old portable CD rewriter."
