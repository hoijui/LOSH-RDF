function = "This is a smalll breakout board featuring two logic-level MOSFETS for driving any sorts of heaters, DC motors, solenoids etc. It has been successfully tested as a spindle driver with 32 KHz PWM and a 27 V power supply.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen any problems with noise / signal stability (tested with an Arduino duemilanove).\r\n\r\nThe MOSFETS are placed on screw terminals to simplify replacement operations just in case some experimental manipulation happens to release the magic smoke.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the schematics and pcb drawing files are in gEDA (not Eagle) format."
