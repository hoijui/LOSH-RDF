function: "This is my printable replacement for the stock reel holder that handles reels with smaller hole diameters. \r\n\r\nI bought several batches of PLA which came on reels with ~37mm diameter openings. They don't fit on the stock holder, but they fit on this one quite nicely.\r\n\r\nThe STLs I uploaded will fit reels up to ~6.5cm wide and down to a ~37mm diameter hole. You can easily modify the length to handle wider reels via the OpenSCAD file. \r\n\r\nVersion 2 (V2 files) has a slightly wider gap between the tongues that fit onto the Ultimaker in order to address the issue encountered by Owen. I haven't tried printing the new version, so if you do please let me know how it turns out. If I get confirmation it fixes the issue I will delete the old version."
