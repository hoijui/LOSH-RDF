function = "This is a set of tile trays for the board game Small World that replaces the tray included with the game.\r\n\r\nI found that with the included tray you had to split up certain races (skeletons) and either split up several other races or have their tiles sticking up above the lip of the tray. \r\n\r\nThe slots in these trays are specifically sized to the number of tiles for each race. \r\n\r\nThe set of three trays also take up less space in the box and are more robust."
