\r
I found that with the included tray you had to split up certain races (skeletons) and either split up several other races or have their tiles sticking up above the lip of the tray. \r
\r
The slots in these trays are specifically sized to the number of tiles for each race. \r
\r
The set of three trays also take up less space in the box and are more robust.""" ;
