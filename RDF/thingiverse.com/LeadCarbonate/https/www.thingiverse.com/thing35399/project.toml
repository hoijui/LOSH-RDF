function = "Show your holiday confection comrades your Paradox Interactive love with this Paradox Interactive logo cookie cutter.  It's sure to inspire a coup for the last one.\r\n\r\nThis is the second (printed) iteration of the design.  It was successfully printed but has not yet been tested.  PDXCC mark 3 was tested and produced the cookie pictured but was too thick.  The mark 8 design has a more tapered cutting edge and is shallower allowing for a better impression in the dough."
