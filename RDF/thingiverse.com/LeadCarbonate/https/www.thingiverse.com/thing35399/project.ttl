\r
This is the second (printed) iteration of the design.  It was successfully printed but has not yet been tested.  PDXCC mark 3 was tested and produced the cookie pictured but was too thick.  The mark 8 design has a more tapered cutting edge and is shallower allowing for a better impression in the dough.""" ;
