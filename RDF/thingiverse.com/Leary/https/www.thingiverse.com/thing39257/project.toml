function = "My MendelMax is configured such that it sits on my bench with the Y tensioner facing me, and the X stepper on the right side with the belts in the front. I use Ultibotâ€™s  excellent fan duct http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29985 also. In my configuration the fan is at the front, which obstructs my view of the hotend. I wanted to be able to mount the fan in the back so I made this.\r\n\r\nI used SketchUp to do this. The SketchUp project is also attached."
