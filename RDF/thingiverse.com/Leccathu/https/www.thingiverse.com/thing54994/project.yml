function: "This is a model of the marine mosasaur Tylosaurus proriger, found in the Western Interior Seaway in North America, and found at lengths of up to 35-40 feet. Stomach contents found associated with Tylosaurus have included fish, sharks, smaller mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and flightless diving birds. Due to so many tylosaurs depicted eating more charismatic plesiosaurs, etc., I went against the grain and depicted a prey item a little less famous, though still interesting; an unspecific species of fish under the genus Pachyrhizodus, which have been discovered at lengths up to three feet.\r\n\r\nMedia: ZBrush 4R4\r\nTime: ~4-5 hours\r\n\r\nCreated by Stephanie Dziezyk/\"Leccathu\" 2/22/2013"
