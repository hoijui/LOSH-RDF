function = "A test print to help you figure out how much clearance you need for two printed parts to fit into each other.\r\n\r\nThe main peg is a 5mm x 5mm cube. The peg board has holes of the following dimensions:\r\n\r\n4.8mm x 4.8mm\r\n4.9mm x 4.9mm\r\nâ€¦\r\n5.8mm x 5.8mm\r\n\r\nIn my print, the 5.1mm x 5.1mm slot ( 0.05mm clearance per side) gave a good and very tight fit - perhaps for permanent connections. The 5.2mm x 5.2mm square (0.1mm clearance per side) gave a good generally-useful fit."
