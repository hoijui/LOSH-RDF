function = "A test print to help you figure out how much clearance you need for two printed parts to fit into each other.\r\n \r\nThe main peg is a cylinder with a radius of 5mm. The peg board has holes with radiuses of the following dimensions:\r\n \r\n2.5mm\r\n2.55mm\r\nâ€¦\r\n2.95mm\r\n3.0mm\r\n \r\nIn my print, the 2.65mm gave the best generally usable fit, with 2.70 still acceptable."
