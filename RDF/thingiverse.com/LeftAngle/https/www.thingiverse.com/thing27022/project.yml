function: "This puzzle was described on my Instructables page,\r\n\r\n>http://www.instructables.com/id/A-Diabolical-Puzzle/<\r\n\r\nbut since I've been having such a great time giving these away to strangers, I'm adding it here.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to make the 2 pieces into a pyramid.  It can be done, but it's not as easy as you might think.  A great ice breaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: \r\n\r\nAdanA took cymon's comment about cutting the pieces in half and ran with it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29082\r\n\r\nExponentially more difficult and more likely to win lunch bets.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of that movie where a hitchhiker had the idea about doing the guy who invented the \"6 Minute Abs\" one better by coming up with \"5 Minute Abs\".\r\n\r\nWell here's my entry into the multi-pyramid puzzle war... No, it's not 6 pieces, just 4 cut a different way."
