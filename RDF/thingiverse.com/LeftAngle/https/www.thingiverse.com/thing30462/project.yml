function: "As Comedian Jack Black says; \"This is hard\" \r\n\r\nThis grid replicates the layout grid illustrated in your ReplicatorG file and puts it onto your real-life build platform.  It makes it far easier to determine where on your platform the build will take place.  I believe Makerbot's  build platforms are made one at a time, so this is file is dimensioned to fit my plate.\r\n\r\nAlso...\r\n\r\nif you use glass as your substrate, it's common practice to clamp it to the aluminum platform with spring metal clips.\r\n\r\nClips sit above the build surface and require careful planning on where they're placed.  Also, glass isn't a perfectly rigid material. Glass is actually quite flexible and if your aluminum plate isn't perfectly flat, glass will take on the plate's shape when it's clamped to it (thicker is better here).\r\n\r\nThe holders in this file sit below the build surface and hold the glass by its sides.  No vertical pressure is applied so the glass stays completely flat."
