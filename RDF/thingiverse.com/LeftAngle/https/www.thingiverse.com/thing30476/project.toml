function = "A few crashes into the top of the Replicator's Z axis stop started throwing off the build plate's home position.  I discovered the Z axis stop switch was held in place by it's mounting lugs in a sheer position.  Whenever the carriage missed the switch, the motor continued to drive the stage upward, bending the switch up with it.  I needed to repair the stop switch.\n\n Pulling the stop was easy...\n\nPutting it back wasn't.  The right-most bolt is located directly behind the Z axis drive screw.  My fingers are fat and my eyesight is failing.\n\n2 hours into trying to thread nuts, spacers and circuit boards into place, I gave up short of removing the Z axis motor and took another route to solving my problem.\n\nThe trouble is, I didn't make it with my printer (no Z axis stop, remember?).\n\nI'll show you what I did with pictures and throw in a bonus project for the required download:)"
