Trouble is 6+ hours of full time GPS use tends be a major drain to the battery. In previous years I had purchased commercial versions similar to this, they only lasted about a year, and were not as high capacity as I was able to build here. \r\n\r\nI found that I was able to keep my phone running for about two and a half days with this battery pack. \r\n\r\nBattery - http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8484\r\nCharger/Booster - http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10300"
