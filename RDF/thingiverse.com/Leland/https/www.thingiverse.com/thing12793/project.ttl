\r
A group of friends and I go hiking every year and I like to plot our trips using the GPS in my phone and the Google Tracks application. Trouble is 6+ hours of full time GPS use tends be a major drain to the battery. In previous years I had purchased commercial versions similar to this, they only lasted about a year, and were not as high capacity as I was able to build here. \r
\r
I found that I was able to keep my phone running for about two and a half days with this battery pack. \r
