function = "A friendly looking Makerbot mascot entry. Designed to be both fun to assemble and printable with out any overhangs. I know some overhangs are allowed but I decided to challenge myself to zero. The wheels can stamp little \"M\"s in dirt, or clay or be rolled on an ink pad.\r\n\r\nI originally wanted to make a little cat train, hopefully I'll be able to finish it in time to submit it to the contest."
