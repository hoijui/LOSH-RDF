function: "This is a replacement oil barrel for the board game \"Power Grid\" by Friedmann Friese and Rio Grande Games.\r\nI have always wanted pieces that looked more like what they are supposed to be than the wood tokens included in the game.  Although the oil barrel piece looks pretty good out of the box, I decided to spruce it up a bit by adding bands around the drum to make it look more like a real oil drum.\r\nThis barrel is the same size as the stock piece, so it should integrate seamlessly into your game."
