function: "Last night, my wife needed a circle template for an art project she was doing.  This took about 15 minutes to make in total, from design to finished product.  And that is why 3D printing is awesome.\r\n\r\nThe largest hole is 4cm diameter and they decrease in diameter by 0.5cm to a minimum size of 0.5cm.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested, I could take a stab at parametrizing this in OpenSCAD."
