function = "This is a replacement oil barrel for the board game \"Power Grid\" by Friedmann Friese and Rio Grande Games.\r\nThis is the piece that I dislike the most in the base game.  It's a brown wooden cube.  So I wanted to create a piece that more closely reflects the game's art for the coal resource, namely a large pyramidal pile.\r\nI am not quite satisfied with the look of this piece on account of how it looks more like a pile of cannon balls than anything else."
