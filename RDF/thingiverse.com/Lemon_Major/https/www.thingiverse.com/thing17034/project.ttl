I am marking this as "in progress" as I have neither printed this thing yet, or designed the spoon.  But I'm running out of time to make this my thing-a-day for Saturday, so here we are.\r
Be careful about storing food in ABS.  I'm sure that there's not much that could go wrong here, especially since this is for dry food, but I can't guarantee there won't be any possibility of contamination.  Use your best judgement.\r
\r
-Edit- I have replaced the original version of the bowl, since it had a fillet on the bottom that doesn't print well without support.  The new version has a 45 degree chamfer.\r
\r
-Edit- I have added a new version of the bowl with a chamfer on its rim.  This allows the lid to sit more comfortably.  I have also uploaded a spoon for this bowl ( thingiverse.com/thing:17156 )""" ;
