function: "This is a replacement garbage piece for the board game \"Power Grid\" by Friedmann Friese and Rio Grande Games.\r\nI modelled this after the weird plutonium containers from \"Back to the Future.\"  These would look great if it were possible to print the outer cylinder in clear PVA and the inner in red, but I haven't the ability to do so."
