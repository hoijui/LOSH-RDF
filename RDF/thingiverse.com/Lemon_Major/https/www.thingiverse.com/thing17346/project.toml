function = "This is a standard military lettering style stencil in 28pt font.\r\n-Edit-  The 28pt stencil is way too small to print reliably on my machine.  I have uploaded a 48pt stencil as well, which works a lot better.  If you have your profile tuned to give really high x and y resolution, you might be able to get the original stencil to work.  If not, try the 48pt model."
