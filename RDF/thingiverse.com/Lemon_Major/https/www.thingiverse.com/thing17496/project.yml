function: "This is a governor, similar to what was once used on steam engines.  It is meant to be attached to the drive train of a rotary device.  As it spins, the arms are pulled upwards by centrifugal forces, causing the plunger in the center to move down.  Normally this would be used to apply a brake to the device, slowing it down.  Esentially, it's a primitive form of speed regulation.\r\n\r\nI built this without any application in mind, so it lacks attachment points and so on."
