function = "This is a derivative of Emmett's Screwless Heart Gears (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12208).  I did this mostly as an exercise in figuring out Emmett's OpenSCAD code, and using it to gear-ify a shape that isn't a cube or a heart.\r\nI picked Wootfish's stellated octahedron (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3219) as the base shape, but the code is versatile enough to make many solid bodies into gears.\r\n\r\nI am a little disappointed in the final product, as it kinda looks like a spiky pile of nonsense regardless of the orientation of the gears.  That being said, it was a fun exercise, and the prints are really cool."
