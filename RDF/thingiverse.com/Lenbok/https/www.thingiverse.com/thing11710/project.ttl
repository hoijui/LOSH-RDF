\r
Share your techniques to allow mesh-newbies to making this (and other objects) printable.\r
\r
For fun, I tried slicing and printing it, but skeinforge was complaining all the way. It actually printed fairly well considering - the main problem was that somewhere near the top skeinforge decided to stop creating infill, so the top of the back and hindquarters had no support as they were closing over.""" ;
