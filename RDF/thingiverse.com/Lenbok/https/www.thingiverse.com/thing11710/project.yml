function: "This is a model that I would like to use to get feedback on model cleanup techniques. Being designed for animation rather than 3d printing, there are bunches of protruding triangles, self-intersecting triangles, possibly some faces oriented the wrong way, maybe holes too.\r\n\r\nShare your techniques to allow mesh-newbies to making this (and other objects) printable.\r\n\r\nFor fun, I tried slicing and printing it, but skeinforge was complaining all the way. It actually printed fairly well considering - the main problem was that somewhere near the top skeinforge decided to stop creating infill, so the top of the back and hindquarters had no support as they were closing over."
