function = "This thing has a couple of replacement dishwasher parts: \r\n\r\n- The runner/slider that attaches the upper rack to the slider rails. The original had wheels at two heights but we only ever used the top wheel.\r\n\r\n- Replacement cutlery basket bottoms. The grid is a two-level deal to keep the cutlery ends distributed on the bottom of the basket rather than all ending up in the corners."
