function = "Wade's original geared extruder block is too big to print on a makerbot.\r\n\r\nI remade the extruder block in OpenSCAD so that I could then carefully downscale parts of the extruder block to make it manageable.  (I was inspired by the guy who used OpenSCAD to \"patch\" the original STL to take a BfB hot end, but for what I wanted to do it seemed better to recreate the whole thing)."
