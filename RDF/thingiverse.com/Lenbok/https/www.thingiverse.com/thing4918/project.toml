function = "When printing raftless it can be helpful to add a bounding box type extrusion on the first layer of the print, kind of like nophead uses (see http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2010/01/hot-metal-and-serendipity.html\r\n). This outline gives the extruder some extra time to begin extruding properly before beginning your object, and so you get an early verification of where your object\r\nwill sit on the platform.  Being a plugin you can turn the outline on and off as part of your usual skeinforge profiles."
