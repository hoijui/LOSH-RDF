function = "I just upgraded to a Nexus 4 so needed to upgrade my car mount as well. As well as the snap-fit phone holder, I added a customizable air-vent mount. These use the same M3 attachments as my Galaxy S car holder, so the phone holder / mount points are interchangeable with those (e.g. if you wanted to use the air vent mount with the snap-fit Galaxy S holder).
