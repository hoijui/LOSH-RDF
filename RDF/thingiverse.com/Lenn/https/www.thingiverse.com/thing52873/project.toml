function = "This reel holder design keeps your PLA dry.  \nPLA is very susceptible to moisture, it is essential that it is kept dry to prevent problems. http://www.shini.com/ep_edm/en/contect_246.html  \nThe main problem I had was the extruder blocking, especially with older filament. Newly unpacked filament worked properly for a few hours but started blocking within a day.  \nNow I have been printing without problem for over a week.  \nMk8 upgrade without cutting for REP 2 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35810 ,  \nadding oil to the filament as described at  \nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:103729 and  \nSurface Finish Calibration Test Shape http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39050  \nalso helped greatly."
