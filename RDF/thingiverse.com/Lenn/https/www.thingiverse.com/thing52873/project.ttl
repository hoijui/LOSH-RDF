    okh:function """This reel holder design keeps your PLA dry.  
PLA is very susceptible to moisture, it is essential that it is kept dry to prevent problems. http://www.shini.com/ep_edm/en/contect_246.html  
The main problem I had was the extruder blocking, especially with older filament. Newly unpacked filament worked properly for a few hours but started blocking within a day.  
Now I have been printing without problem for over a week.  
Mk8 upgrade without cutting for REP 2 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35810 ,  
adding oil to the filament as described at  
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:103729 and  
Surface Finish Calibration Test Shape http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39050  
also helped greatly.""" ;
