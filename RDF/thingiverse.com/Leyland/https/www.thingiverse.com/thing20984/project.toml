function = "This is the first prototype of my 3d mouse. It was created to test out the precision of the sensors and lacks a grip and buttons.\r\n\r\nTo see it in action:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taLBV3AzXNk\r\nin stereoscopic 3d:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyEZV3lYuxE\r\n\r\nI am using a Phidget I/O board and 3 of their potentiometers.\r\n\r\nThe demo program was created in python using the phidget library, pygame, and pyopengl.\r\n\r\nTo hold it on to the table I am using Rotoscan's Clamp with some Sugru for grip:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12616\r\n\r\nI think for now I will explore the software side of things, I'd like to integrate alternative input support into Blender 3D, and maybe try to use Kinect to see what the quality of 3d tracking is. The reason I created this now is that I have actually wanted to create this several years ago (before Kinect, before Arduino), and had the Phidget i/o board and potentiometers sitting in storage for a long time and the difficulty for me was in creating the frame, and now that I have a 3D printer it is much easier to create things like this."
