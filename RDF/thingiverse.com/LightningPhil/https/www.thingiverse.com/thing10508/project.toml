function = "Extruder and stepper cooler.  Sends some air through duct to filament drive gear.\r\n\r\nThe idea of uber ventilation is to keep the filiment cool and prevent it stripping.  The sides of the cowel allow the air stream to stay near the stepper.\r\n\r\nIf this works well then it'll be time to print it in glow-in-the-dark ABS and apply some UV LEDs."
