This has to happen though!\r\n\r\nA Van de Graaff generator is essentially a box, a tube and a ball with some gubbins that connect it together and move the charge about.\r\n\r\nA box, tube and ball are easy.  With a 3D printer, so are the gubbins.\r\n\r\nWhen I get more plastic (3 days from now!) the beast will come to life.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, the ball can be picked up from homebase from about Â£20."
