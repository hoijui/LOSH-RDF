function = "Hold a caliper and 3 hex keys neatly on the front of the makerbot.  Now I can find them!\r\n\r\nEveryone needs a caliper.  Much easier to read a digital display than guess fractions of a mm.  The hex keys come with the makerbot.  Seemed a good holder to put them all together in one place.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, I have a small holder for a craft knife and a tourch.  Might draw them again, but didn't keep the STL's.\r\n\r\nThis was my first go at using Solid Works.  Far easier than expected!  :)"
