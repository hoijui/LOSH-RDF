function: "Derivative of a toy.  Challenges the idea that nostalgia must be bought back from corporations...\r\n\r\nI've tried to make this file parametric.  The idea was to have the gripper and handle resize automatically depending on the dimensions of the arms.  That kind of was implemented but you will have to play with some hard coded values to make it work properly.  I could use some help with this if anyone is up to it. I'd like to make it snap together as well..."
