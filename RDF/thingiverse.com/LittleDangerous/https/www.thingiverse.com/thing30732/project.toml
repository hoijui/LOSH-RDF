function = "This thing is a fan mount to cool off a TrackIR 4 sensor.  These units get very hot, they're barely touchable where the processor is after they've been on a while.  I've lost one unit already (probably to heat) and now that it's out of warranty, I can't afford to lose another, so I designed a little removable fan mount to cool it.  A slightly breeze is all that's needed to drastically reduce its temperature and extend its life."
