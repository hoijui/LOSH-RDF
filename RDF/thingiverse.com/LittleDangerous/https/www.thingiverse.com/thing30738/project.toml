function = "These C clips are designed to clamp onto 8MM threaded rod.  These can replace nuts in a lot of situations.  They clamp very well, do not slid on the rod, don't rotate easily, and are easy to add and remove.\r\n\r\nI designed these for my spool & mount system (not yet uploaded) to replace the tedium of adding/removing nuts on long lengths of threaded rod."
