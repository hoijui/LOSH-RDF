function = "This is another printable filament spool & matching mount, but with style!  There are plenty of others out there, but most were too small to hold the filament I usually buy and were blocky looking.  Mine has a faceted, stealthy look and is customizable, to hold different filament spool sizes, without having to make changes to the printed parts, you just need to cut the threaded rods to different lengths.  The mounting system is designed for the Reprap.\r\n\r\nThis design was inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8331"
