function = "I designed this power supply mounting bracket to fit my PSU which had a different mounting hole arrangement than the ancestor part this is based off of.  The ancestor part was designed for PSUs with 2 mounting holes on both sides.  However my PSU has 3 holes on one side and none on the other, but it did have 4 holes on the bottom, so I designed a combination of brackets to fit each unique mounting situation.\r\n\r\nSource files inside zip."
