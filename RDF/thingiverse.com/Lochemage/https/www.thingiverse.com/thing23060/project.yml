function: "Update July 23, 2012:\r\nUploaded a more stable version 3 of the fan mounts that are solid between the two screw mounts for the fan.\r\n\r\nUpdate May 21, 2012:\r\nI don't know why I didn't think of this in the first place, but I've made a version 2 of the previous mounts that print flat on their backs instead of standing up.  This gives them a more solid structural support and will hopefully keep them from breaking easily.\r\n\r\nUpdate May 16, 2012:\r\nI've also uploaded a 20 and a 30 degree angled version (named with the postfix 20d and 30d) of the mount in case you want your fans to aim downward.\r\n\r\nThis is a 40mm fan mount meant to be mounted on the bolt(s) that connect the extruder block to the X-Carriage on the MakerGear Prusa and is meant to be inline with the X tracks."
