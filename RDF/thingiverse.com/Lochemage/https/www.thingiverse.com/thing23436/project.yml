function: "Update Dec 16, 2013:  \nUpdated the Arduino code with a new option called BLINK_TEST.  The blink test is a debugging option that will blink all lights in sequence from top-left to bottom-right, column by column.  Each light should activate for one second, turn off, and then the next light in the sequence should continue the pattern.  This is intended to debug and ensure that all wiring is correctly assembled.  If a light fails to blink, or the wrong light activates when it shouldn't, you most likely have a wiring issue with either the LED that should have been lit, or the LED that was lit out of sequence.  \n\nUpdate May 21, 2012:  \nI've uploaded a Fritzing file that illustrates the schematic for the Binary Clock.  Download Fritzing here http://fritzing.org/.  I'm not alltogether sure how the schematic and PCB views are supposed to look, so I mainly paid attention to the breadboard view.  If anyone feels inclined to update it, please send it my way!  \n\nI decided that I wanted to learn how circuit boards worked, so I picked up an Arduino UNO starter kit and went to work.  \n\nAs my first project, I thought it would be neat to have a little home made binary clock on my desk at work, so I decided this would be my first project.  The white light represents Am, yellow show the current hour, green are minutes, and red are seconds.  \n\nIf you are familiar with binary, you'll understand what the lights mean, otherwise check this out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system.  \n\nHere is a small video showing it in action http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXBh5Zqhoss&list=FLSD1-_SkYPcnzfSHYnXrqcw&feature=mh_lolz  \n\nThis is still a work in progress because I plan to also design a 3D printable case for it."
