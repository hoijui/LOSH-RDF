I've created a version 2 of the double battery cover that is designed to look better, enjoy!\r
\r
Update June 06, 2012:\r
After a little experimentation, I found it is easier to assemble if your batteries are facing negative side up, and the button feels better if you clip the top LED lead short enough that it just crosses the center of wedge on the underside of the button.\r
\r
I'm always a fan of having handy flashlights on my keys, I find plenty of uses for them.  I've taken Roland's motorcycle keychain and modified it so it can house an LED light!  The only things you need, other than printing the plastic parts, are an LED, a small plastic tube, and one or two batteries of either CR2032 or CR2016.""" ;
