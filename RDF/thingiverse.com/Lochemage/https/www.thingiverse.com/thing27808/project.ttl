    okh:function """This is my take on the bowdens mount for dual extruding on the MakerGear Prusa (along with my previous upgrade on the Z-Axis).\r
\r
I've taken the 2 Extruder Mod by dob71 and redesigned the hotend mount for easier assembly.  I have also resized everything to fit 1.75 filament.\r
\r
The X-Carriage has a wider opening to give enough room for both hotends.\r
\r
Just as a note, I have been using this setup for about 2 months now (as of Aug 02, 2012).  I've mostly used it as a single extruder because I haven't gotten a concrete way of generating dual-extrusion gcode yet (working on it).  The print quality isn't perfect, but it isn't bad either (in fact, the pictures you see are all from a second set printed while using my first set).  I ended up using a slow retraction of 10mm to remove the blobbing and nozzle drip.""" ;
