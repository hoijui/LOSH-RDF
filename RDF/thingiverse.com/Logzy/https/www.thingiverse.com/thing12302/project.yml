function: "This is a forced cooling enclosure i created to suit the Gen 6 electronics.\r\nThe fan duct is glued onto the main cover as im too lazy to change it to a snap on, plus glued could have several advantages.\r\n\r\nThe cover snaps onto the base and a 40mm fan is attached to the fan duct.\r\nThis creates a wider higher pressure flow of air for cooling in the important places.\r\n\r\nIt provides good forced cooling keeping the board cool."
