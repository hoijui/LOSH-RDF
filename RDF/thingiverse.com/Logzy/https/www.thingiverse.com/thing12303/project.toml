function = "A LED lighting solution for the print bed / print head.\r\nThis uses an adhesive strip of LED's which run at 12Vdc so you can connect them to a cooling fan supply etc.\r\n\r\nThe LED's are cleverly made so you cut the strip on the line marked in modules of 3 and they only cost $2.95 per 3 LED segment.\r\n\r\nI used two strips of 3 LED's and then stuck them with the adhesive backing and a tiny amount of silicone to the underside of the travelling x axis carridge.\r\n\r\nAlso comes with free printable trolley coin for pupping in the grocery trolley at the supermarket instead of using a $1 or $2 coin.\r\n(Because i had to add a file that wasn an image to publish)"
