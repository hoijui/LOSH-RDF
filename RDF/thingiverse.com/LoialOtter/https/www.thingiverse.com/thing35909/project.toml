function = "This is an idler with teeth to increase the ability to hold the tracks in place. If attached to a power source somehow they'd be able to drive the treads but that was not my intention (I'll be making one of those soon based on this design).\r\n\r\nThis is for: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35668\r\n\r\nThe length between points was found to be different than expected through trial and error.\r\n\r\nSorry - Had to update... it helps to double-check that the hub doesn't interfere with the gear part of it. Now fixed.\r\n\r\nAnd one more fix - I should really test before releasing my items. hehehe. Adjusted outside diameter of teeth down quite a ways. Adjusted width of teeth up a bit and made angle a little better for printing."
