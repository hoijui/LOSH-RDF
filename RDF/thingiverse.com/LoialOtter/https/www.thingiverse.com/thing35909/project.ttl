\r
This is for: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35668\r
\r
The length between points was found to be different than expected through trial and error.\r
\r
Sorry - Had to update... it helps to double-check that the hub doesn't interfere with the gear part of it. Now fixed.\r
\r
And one more fix - I should really test before releasing my items. hehehe. Adjusted outside diameter of teeth down quite a ways. Adjusted width of teeth up a bit and made angle a little better for printing.""" ;
