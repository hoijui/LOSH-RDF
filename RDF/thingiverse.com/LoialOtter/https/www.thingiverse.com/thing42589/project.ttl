    okh:function """This is an operational pneumatic/hydraulic cylinder. The main goal with this was to make a cheap and easy to produce cylinder for use on interesting projects. It's also a proof of concept.\r
\r
I've used central vacuum tubing as it's very cheap ($6.50/12ft section) and is rigid. Other pipe can be used and the OpenSCAD files have variables at the beginning to customize the parts.\r
\r
There are mounting holes (optional) on the front and back faces along with (again, optional) the sides of both the front and back.\r
\r
This was developed and built using my overly large 3d printer called Tiny. See https://ottersoft.ca/ for details and news.""" ;
