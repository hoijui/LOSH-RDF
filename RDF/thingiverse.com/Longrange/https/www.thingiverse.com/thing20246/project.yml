function: "This part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/things/hooLZxdcdNI\r\nThis is my second build in tinker cad and i must say it is a really nice program for beginners. I have done some modeling in Blender, and Sketchup whitch have much more capabilities than tinkercad, but tinkercad's click and drag system makes everything really simple. this is my second build, took me about 1hr. my first print i am saving to upload until later. this is just to show what tinkercad can and can't do."
