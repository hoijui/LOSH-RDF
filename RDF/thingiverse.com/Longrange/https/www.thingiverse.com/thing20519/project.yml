function: "This part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/things/emhMfSIzXL1\r\nthis was my first idea bot's for makerbot. i really like the Tinkercad program... it is a very easy to learn 3d modeling program, i have not used any tutorials on it and i have figured it all out. i think this program would be a great tool for example a teacher that want's to teach their students about 3d printing can teach them this program very easily. i would highly recommend this program to anyone that wants to get into 3d modeling."
