you still may use this for legacy purposes but I highly encourage you to use the new script  




Hello everyone, this is an idea that i have had for quite a while but have never been able to implement until now with the MakerBot customizer. what this does is it will generate gears/cogs based on parameters that you give it from the command line. at the moment it can generate standard gears, cogs, single helix gears, and double helix gears. the double helix is a little messed up. but i just learned openSCAD tonight so i'll try to fix it later (you could just make a single helix and then use another software to make it into a double helix)  
Please Please Please give me some feed back as to if you would like to see anything added (more parameters, more types of gears, etc...)  
Thanks for viewing  

btw i will change the licence once the competition is over with""" ;
