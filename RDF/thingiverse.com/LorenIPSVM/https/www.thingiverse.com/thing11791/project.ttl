\r
Heads will ROLL! (off the automated build platform after they are finished printing)\r
\r
REPLICANT - g is an open book; instead of smiling or frowning it just prints what it is thinking. It can take on many forms, and can impersonate anyone. It also can print new sneakers for itself when they go out of style.\r
\r
Design and print as many faces / expressions / customizations as you want and plug them into the automated build platform- to print a head that fits just print out the short pegs by Tbuser on Thingiverse and mod the head to fit on the peg. Attach to the hole punched out in REPLICANT -gâ€™s automated build platform. \r
\r
Also 3mm filament should be chopped and placed in the back of the arms and connected to the body in the 2 small holes in back.\r
\r
Print REPLICANT - g in UV reactive green because that is what the g stands for (also gangster, gcode)\r
\r
If you print in red it will be REPLICANT - r , if you print in blue and black he will be called REPLICANT - b&b\r
\r
thank you Tbuser of thingiverse and also Bothacker for the skull version I show in the pic- (also Steve Colbert in the second image)\r
\r
I have started uploading heads that fit inside - all you need is to print a small peg from Tbuser's bot toolkit and it should attach to the hole in the ABP\r
\r
I'm a total noob here - to thingiverse and thing-o-matic, but I tried to stay within the guidelines of the bot challenge.....because I want a thing-o-matic...............badly!!!\r
\r
9-26-11 Bre's head has been updated to have a centered hole in the bottom- sorry about the last one, I think the booloean must have nudged off center before I exported it.""" ;
