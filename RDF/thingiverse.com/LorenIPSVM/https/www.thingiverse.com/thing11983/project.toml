function = "this is REPLICANT - gâ€™s lilâ€™ bruddr (little brother)-\r\n\r\nIf you think you gave your parents grief writing on the walls with crayons, you ainâ€™t got nothin on this guy who writes everywhere in ABS.\r\n\r\nprint in UV reactive red if you dare, but be careful around black lights....\r\n\r\nHis shoes leave the makerbot logo wherever he goes, and printin him is simpler than my other entry because all his body parts will fit on a makerbot 100mm x 100mm plate (except for head)\r\n\r\nat this scale he is compatible with Tbuserâ€™s robot toolkit parts- I created a t-joint for the legs based off his peg design too.\r\n\r\nspecial thanks to NYCdesigner from thingiverse who printed out REPLICANT - g and posted some good pics, so I had some other thoughts about making a smaller version that could be printed quicker."
