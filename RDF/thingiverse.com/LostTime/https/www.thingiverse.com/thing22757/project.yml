function: "Old ammunition boxes are great for all hobby purposes like fishing, camping and so on. They are water and dust tight, cheap and durable.\r\nI've created this box to store small parts like fishing gear, spare parts for model aircrafts, cars or any other outdoor product.\r\nIt fits nicely into an standard ammo box (cal. 300x7.62 or 840/930x5.56 or 100x.50) and it has 3 big compartments for big tools and parts and 5 drawers of different sizes for all those easy-to-lose parts. 3 of those drawers are dividable by a divider.\r\nA latch stops the drawers from opening."
