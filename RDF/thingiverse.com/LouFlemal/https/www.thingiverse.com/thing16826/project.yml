function: When they went to turn on the Jib in one of our studios, they noticed that the power button was missing. I went to ShapeSmith and cranked out a quick replacement. (The original was green, but I had red loaded, so...) This button will fit any of the Jimmy Jib pushbuttons. They DO have a tendency to get lost, so I'm going to print out a few more.
