function: I've found myself using Canadaduane's thing 13045 pretty often, and had been keeping it in Helmi74's thing 19549, but I was always looking around to find where I'd last put it. I decided to create a new holder that I could stick on the front of my Thing-O-Matic so I always had it right at hand.
