function: "This is inspired by these hand cut paper snow flakes  \nhttp://mattersofgrey.com/diy-star-wars-snowflakes/  \nIf SOPA becomes law, they will use things like this to censor all of thingiverse and the internet. http://boingboing.net/2011/12/15/get-your-war-on-vs-sopa.html  \nLest you think this is impossible, remember how George Lucas treats the word droid as if it is his personal property.  \nThis design is optimized for glow in the dark ABS but you could probably also laser cut it.  \nNote: printer is down for repairs so a picture of a printed version will have to wait until tomorrow."
