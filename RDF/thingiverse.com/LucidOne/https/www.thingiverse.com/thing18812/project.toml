By attaching a 12V DC power supply, the splitter is also useful for using a modified Kinect or a TurtleBot arm independent of the robot base. #6-32 mounting holes align with the 0.75\" hole pattern on the top of the TurtleBot.\r\n\r\nPCB Files on github\r\nhttps://github.com/IHeartRobotics/TurtleBot/tree/master/PCB_Power_Splitter"
