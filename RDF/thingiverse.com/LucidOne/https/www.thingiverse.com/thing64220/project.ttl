    okh:function "At I Heart Engineering, there have been a few issues in which the TurtleBot 2 was damaged during shipping.  The problem is that we currently do not manufacture our own boxes, in fact we still cannot manufacture our own boxes.  However, what we can do is come up with our own structural packaging solutions to protect our products working within the constraints of \"stock\" boxes acquired from elsewhere.  The first effort was directed at protecting the Kobuki base of the TurtleBot 2 during shipping.  Currently, the shipping department modifies the already existing Kobuki packaging to fit inside of the \"stock\" box and foam inserts to protect the plates.  Our question now, is how to create support for the Kobuki base using our digital manufacturing tools, or if you prefer, the Epilog Helix Laser." ;
