function = "This is the LED ornament topper that was a collaboration between CCCKC Hackerspace and Hammerspace Hobby & Community Toolshop (our new home) in Kansas City. It is a fun, quick 4 soldering point ornament insert. The LED cycles between several colors and modes with each on and off cycle. We decided to keep it awesome by printing the body and using only two components (LED and battery holder) and copper wire to extend the leads to create the ornament hanger and integrated switch!\r\n\r\nWe created this holiday-themed project as a fun way to create a gift and learn to solder at the same time! We hope you enjoy it and please customize it! It is a blank canvas and ripe to become many different characters and uses. One thought is to NOT trim one of the copper leads and have two swirls at the top, tapping those together to become a switch. Slap some googly eyes and BAM, reindeer! And don't forget Hanukkah! Turn these upside down and make a Menorah with 9 prints. You get the idea. Let those derivatives fly and feel free to improve it!\r\n\r\nI used Autocad 123d - http://www.123dapp.com mainly to learn this program a little more, try it, you might like it!\r\n\r\nCowtown Computer Congress of Kansas City - http://C3KC.org\r\n\r\nHammerspace Hobby & Community Toolshop - http://www.hammerspacehobby.com\r\n\r\nNOTE: We specified two different LED's to choose from. Radioshack has an LED in store that works but we ordered ours from http://microelect.net/ over the phone. Yeah, over the phone!"
