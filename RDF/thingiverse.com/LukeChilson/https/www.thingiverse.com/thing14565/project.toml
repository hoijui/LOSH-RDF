function = "Artec has quite the fancy collections of 3d Scans over at http://www.artec3d.com/gallery/3d-models/ .\r\nThis model is of the scan of Soppho's Head. I think this model is absolutely beautiful and was thrilled to find it. The STL has been given a flat bottom and fixed for holes in netfabb.\r\n\r\nI printed her in White PLA from ProtoParadigm. At arms length she looks like she was cast in plaster.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Added a slic3r friendly version by richrap that is half sized and tilted back 5 degrees."
