function: "This is a brief cheat sheet from a blog post to get people up and running with PLA on the MK7. It's very likely the numbers will be similar for the new Replicator crowd that have the MK8 as I believe only the nozzle has changed. If you've got a Replicator try out some PLA and let us know.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning on printing PLA on the Thing-O-Matic with an MK7 or a Replicator you will want to read the related post as it goes into significant detail including step by step instructions. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.protoparadigm.com/2012/04/thing-o-matic-mk7-pla-set-up-and-troubleshooting-mk8/"
