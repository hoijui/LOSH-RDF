\r
Cubby screws into your wall acting as a general wall hanger AND small storage area for keys, sunglasses, anything. This is the first of its kind i've seen which is surprising considering how simple and obvious the idea is once you see it.  \r
\r
By posting my own version, I in no means intend to take away from the original; only to spread this good idea so others can see it. The injection moulded version is sure to be smoother, stronger and larger than a printed version anyways.\r
\r
I will happily remove this thing should the original creators feel there has been IP infringement, though the simple geometry of the device means controlling its creation by others will be difficult.""" ;
