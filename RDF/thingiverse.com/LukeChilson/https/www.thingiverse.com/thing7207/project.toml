function = "Topography of a lake and mountain made in blender using a heightmap to displace vertices. It ended up being a great exercise for my new ToM and looks pretty awesome. I printed mine at .3mm thickness and would be interested to see it in different colors, larger build or smaller thickness. I made this several years ago and have lost the original heightmap, if I stumble across it I'll upload it as well. The STL file ended up being fairly massive, if anyone knows how to drop it down without any detail loss I'll do it. The blender file includes an object or two that I was using in a water simulation and thought I'd leave them in should anyone care to play around with it."
