function = "This will guard your Thingomatic's Y-axis idle pulley from those pesky cords and cables wanting to slither behind it and wreak various amounts of havoc. I can now trust that long prints won't suffer from slipped steps due to cables from my heated bed getting caught. If you haven't installed a drag chain and/or do a lot of hacking on your bot I highly recommend installing this on your machine."
