function = "This rail will bolt to 20mm T-slot ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9013 ) and is being tested as a replacement for steel rod and rail. PLA is recommended to avoid warping and curling during cooling. If using ABS turn down the speed for that first layer and cook it into the bed. A bit more info is available on the reprap wiki here,  ( http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Betzbot ) with more to be coming soon."
