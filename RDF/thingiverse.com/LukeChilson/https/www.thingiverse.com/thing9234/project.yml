function: "When calamity strikes and desperation sets in it's time to kludge. My MK6 hotend and I had developed a very destructive relationship, and this time I was sure she was never coming back. But when your friend needs a shiny new Mendel one must work with what one's got. In this case, one had a piece of 1/4 inch aluminum and nichrome wire. This hotend is about as unsafe as you can get, do not use it unless you keep the entire bucket brigade on retainer. Perks to this nozzle include:\r\n\r\n1. Heat-up time of 20s\r\n2. Glowing metal\r\n3. Increased alertness via fear of death\r\n\r\nIf you are desperate enough to repeat this folly, please tell us. Or at least your wife, girlfriend, friends, neighbors...maybe update your will.\r\nI see we already have one thing tagged kludge...well here's another."
