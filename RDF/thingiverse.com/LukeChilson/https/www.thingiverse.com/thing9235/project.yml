function: "After a brief and well, fiery romance with http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9234 I said my goodbyes, bit the bullet and looked at my old MK6.\r\n\r\n\"Hello MK6 hotend.\" I said\r\n\"I hate you.\" Came the reply\r\n\"I wanted to love you, but you came apart at the seems.\" \r\n\"As if you would know, when was the last time you touched me.\" She countered\r\n\"I could see it, your resistors cracking and going to bits.\"\r\n(Tearful dialogue continues, segway into abrupt technical jabble)\r\n\r\nThis is a rework of the stock MK6 that embeds the power resistors in the steel in an MK6 PLUS-esque fashion. It heats up quickly and gives a bit more room for a cooling fan.\r\n\r\nIt has printed spectacularly for 12 hours, but I cannot speak for the long term success so keep that in mind, should anything happen as I continue printing that would be pertinent I will update. \r\n\r\nThis is an all or nothing process that cannot be undone. Once you start, you must finish or have a backup plan ie. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8094  ."
