function: "This is a snap together mount for a skate bearing (608, dimensions 22x7x8mm).\r\n\r\nThese bearing are cheap and are easily available in high precision (ABEC 7, etc.).\r\n\r\nI haven't printed this as I'm still waiting on my Solidoodle so if anyone is game enough to give it a go, feel free to make some suggestions if there's anything that can be improved upon.\r\n\r\nI have also uploaded a horizontal version (thing: 34590, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34590)"
