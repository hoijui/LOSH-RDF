function: "The Aleph Objects bed mount system is a bed mount mod for the Prusa Mendel.\r\n\r\nThe Aluminium Bed Mount Plate design is an aluminium plate with pre-drilled and tapped holes to mount boltable PLA bushings, the Prusajr PCB heated print bed, belt clamps, and Y-axis opto flag. This mount plate is designed to fit onto a Reprap Prusa Mendel 3D printer.\r\n\r\nThis bed mount design requires the y-axis bar clamps to be turned upside down. It would be thought that Z-axis distance would be lost; however, because there is no needed wooden plate, this design actually gives a tiny bit more z-axis clearance.\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended you use the belt stand-offs (belt_standoff.stl) to make the y-axis belt line horizontal. We've also made a y-axis printable opto-flag that can be mounted onto the aluminium plate.\r\n\r\nBoltable PLA Bushings: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10647\r\nPrusajr PCB heat bed http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3919\r\n\r\n**The y-flag needs to be rotated. I'll replace it shortly.**\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n-Parts and files: GPLv3\r\n-Images: CC BY SA"
