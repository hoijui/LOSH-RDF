function = "This is a 12 tooth T5 pulley. The pulley has also been made to use two M3 nuts and two set screws.\r\n\r\nNote: if you are switching from the standard 8 toothed Prusa Mendel pulley you will need to reset your X and Y axes steps/unit in your firmware. You can use the handy dandy RepRapCalculator by Prusajr to find your steps/unit: https://github.com/prusajr/RepRapCalculator\r\n\r\nUpdate: The stl file has been updated with smaller nut traps. We've added the native Solidworks file and a STEP file for those who want to import it into another CAD software.\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n-Parts and files: GPLv3\r\n-Images: CC BY SA"
