function = "Wanting to move away from the cast x-ends but also liking the clamp style, we designed some new ones to work with the boltable PLA bushings. These are interchangeable with the standard Prusa or cast Clonedel x-ends.\r\n\r\nThis x-end set calls for a little extra hardware, but no glue and the ability to change out bushing easily makes up for it.\r\n\r\nHardware:\r\nx8 M3 20mm SHCS\r\nx8 M3 12mm SHCS\r\nx24 M3 washers\r\nx16 M3 Nyloc nuts (or regular nuts)\r\n\r\nThese x-ends use the boltable PLA bushings rather than the glue in PLA bushings. You can find the boltable bushings here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10647. Also, we have made Igus bushings holder for these x-ends too: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13229\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n-Parts and files: GPLv3\r\n-Images: CC BY SA"
