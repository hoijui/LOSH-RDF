These files are only in .stl as we do not currently have access to FreeCAD because of licensing issues between Fedora and OpenCascade. If someone using FreeCAD wants to make these in FreeCAD it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\nAdded double bearing idler that does not need fender washers."
