function = "**NOTE** 1/31/2012: We've updated the design by making the clamps a bit tighter. We found that the smooth rod grooves had a very tight tolerance and would not clamp the rods tight enough in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis is a small update to the AO X-ends. The only major change is the bushing mount wall is beefed up good bit. The clamps are the same but have been uploaded here for ease of downloading the parts.\r\n\r\nWanting to move away from the cast x-ends but also liking the clamp style, we designed some new ones to work with the boltable PLA bushings. These are interchangeable with the standard Prusa or cast Clonedel x-ends.\r\n\r\nThis x-end set calls for a little extra hardware, but no glue and the ability to change out bushing easily makes up for it.\r\n\r\nHardware:\r\nx8 M3 20mm SHCS\r\nx8 M3 12mm SHCS\r\nx24 M3 washers\r\nx16 M3 Nyloc nuts (or regular nuts)\r\nFor the idler\r\nx1 M8 30mm SHCS\r\nx1 M8 Nyloc\r\nx2 M8 washers\r\nx2 Fender washers\r\nx1 608 bearing\r\n\r\nThese x-ends use the boltable PLA bushings rather than the glue in PLA bushings. You can find the boltable bushings here: thingiverse.com/thing:10647. Also, we have made Igus bushings holder for these x-ends too: thingiverse.com/thing:13229\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n-Parts and files: GPLv3\r\n-Images: CC BY SA"
