    okh:function """**NOTE** 1/31/2012: We've updated the design by making the clamps a bit tighter. We found that the smooth rod grooves had a very tight tolerance and would not clamp the rods tight enough in some cases.\r
\r
This is a small update to the AO X-ends. The only major change is the bushing mount wall is beefed up good bit. The clamps are the same but have been uploaded here for ease of downloading the parts.\r
\r
Wanting to move away from the cast x-ends but also liking the clamp style, we designed some new ones to work with the boltable PLA bushings. These are interchangeable with the standard Prusa or cast Clonedel x-ends.\r
\r
This x-end set calls for a little extra hardware, but no glue and the ability to change out bushing easily makes up for it.\r
\r
Hardware:\r
x8 M3 20mm SHCS\r
x8 M3 12mm SHCS\r
x24 M3 washers\r
x16 M3 Nyloc nuts (or regular nuts)\r
For the idler\r
x1 M8 30mm SHCS\r
x1 M8 Nyloc\r
x2 M8 washers\r
x2 Fender washers\r
x1 608 bearing\r
\r
These x-ends use the boltable PLA bushings rather than the glue in PLA bushings. You can find the boltable bushings here: thingiverse.com/thing:10647. Also, we have made Igus bushings holder for these x-ends too: thingiverse.com/thing:13229\r
