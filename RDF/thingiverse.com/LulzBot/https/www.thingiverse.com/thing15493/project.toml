function = "Added an update that has a flange and nut slot. This version can use a hex head bolt and a wing nut. So, no tools needed to loosed or tighten.\r\n\r\nWe've had a few Z-couplers break during shipment so we made these clamps that hold the x-axis from moving. This file is actually just the new bar clamp from the Prusa iteration 2 with one hole made smaller for an M4 screw. Simple part for a simple job.\r\n\r\nHardware:\r\nx1 - M4 30mm SHCS\r\nx2 - M4 washer\r\nx1 - M4 nut"
