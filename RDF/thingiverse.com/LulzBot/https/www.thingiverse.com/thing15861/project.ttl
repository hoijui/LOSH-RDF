    okh:function """We made a redesign of the Z-axis parts as we wanted to beef up the Z axis mounts. The Z motor mount was beefed up as the original was a bit thin and cracked a bit too easy. The bottom Z mount was more stable and is able to hold a 608 bearing for an 8mm drive shaft. The bottom Z mount was also moved from sitting on the table surface and M5 nut captures were added. The z clamp are also different as they are a little shorter than the standard Mendelmax Z-clamps.\r
\r
All of the hardware is the same except you will need two extra M5 10mm screws for the bottom Z-mount. We used x4 M5 14mm screws for the clamps. The M5 14mm screws were actually what we had to use with the standard parts so you may already longer screws there.\r
