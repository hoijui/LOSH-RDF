function = "We have been wanting to make an adjustable z-endstop holder. Tommyc's Z-stop companion seemed to be a much easier fix so we adjusted the design to fit our printers. You will need a little extra length on the X-axis smooth rods to mount the activator. \r\n\r\nWe also removed the trigger arms on the mechanical endstop. The arms tend to bend giving differing points of triggering. The Z-stop activator hits the trigger rather than the trigger arm.\r\n\r\nHardware:\r\nx1 m3 40mm SHCS\r\nx2 m3 12mm SHCS\r\nx3 m3 nut\r\nx2 m3 washer\r\nx1-2 springs"
