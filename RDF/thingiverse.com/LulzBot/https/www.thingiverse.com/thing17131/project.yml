function: "This is a switch mount that we have been using on our LulzBot Prusa Mendel builds. The switch is a snap fit housing. The mount snaps onto the M8 threaded rod and is tightened with 20mm M3 screws and M3 nuts.\r\n\r\nThe switch is used in line with the power supply live wire (black wire). If the switch is turned off, all 12V power to the printer is turned off.\r\n\r\nYou can find the switch we use on mouser here: http://ca.mouser.com/ProductDetail/E-Switch/RE111C1121/?qs=S%2fCBhQS5rCobvMSGNwXBhA%3d%3d"
