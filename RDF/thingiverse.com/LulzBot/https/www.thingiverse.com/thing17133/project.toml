function = "This is a switch mount that we are using with our MendelMax test builds. The switch is the same snap fit switch that we use with our Prusa Mendels. The switch mount has two holes to mount onto the extrusion where ever you like.\r\n\r\nThe switch is used in line with the power supply live wire (black wire). If the switch is turned off, all 12V power to the printer is turned off.\r\n\r\nYou can find the switch we use on mouser here: ca.mouser.com/ProductDetail/E-Switch/RE111C1121/?qs=S%2fCBhQS5rCobvMSGNwXBhA%3d%3d"
