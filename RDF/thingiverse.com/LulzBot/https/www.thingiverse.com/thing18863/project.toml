function = "This is an update to our MendelMax Z axis mounts. It puts the Z motor on the bottom. This also gives the MendelMax a little more head room as the motors no longer stick up off the top of the printer.\r\n\r\nThis part will be seeing some updates shortly, but this version is working on a few of our MendelMax builds."
