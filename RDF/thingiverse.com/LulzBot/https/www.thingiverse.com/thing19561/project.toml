function = "We are currently using these Y axis plates on our scaled down MendelMax builds. These Y axis plates fit the standard MK1 PCB heat bed. There are holes for mounting standard mountable PLA bushings and wider holes for Igus pillow block bushings.\r\n\r\nThis was designed to work on the MendelMax aluminum extrusion design. However it is possible these plates could work on a Prusa Mendel."
