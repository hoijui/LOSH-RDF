function: "Str\xF8mg Lump Leaks is a ceiling lamp designed by Lamp Lumps (LL). \r\n\r\nThe used technique is the self-supporting interlocking of pieces (without glueing, screwing or nailing) of 547 different pieces of polypropylene routed with a three-axis CNC. \r\n\r\nThe conception and materialization are mixed by using digital and analogue means. \r\n\r\nThe first name Str\xC3\xB8mg is the junction of the English term strong with the Danish surname Str\xC3\xB8m. Strong, because it is a robust three-dimensional puzzle witch form is the result of small variations in each of the pieces. Str\xF8m, because this work is a homage to Holger Str\xF8m and his IQ Lamp. \r\n\r\nThe Lump Leaks surnames suggest, for instance, the leaking drops of water or the leaking of information. The abstraction of the concept results, morphologically, in a piece that is the materialisation of the metaball modelling technique that was widely used by pioneers of digital media in architecture in the 1990's."
