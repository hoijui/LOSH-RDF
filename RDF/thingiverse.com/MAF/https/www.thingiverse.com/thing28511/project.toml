function = "Based on \"ArduSnake library: Locomotion of modular snake robots\" by ObiJuan. (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21401)\r\n\r\nBy means of Bluetooth communication, the 4 characteristic parameters of the 2 oscillators, can be modified: amplitude, frequency, phase and offset.\r\n\r\nWith the sign of the phase value, you can change the movement direction: forward or backward. If the oscillators have the same value of phase, movement is not achieved.\r\nBy varying the offset value (midpoint of the oscillations) the device can move in different directions.\r\n\r\nA video can be found here: http://youtu.be/MMdTZWX3w0k\r\n\r\nMore info in my Blog: http://madebyfrutos.wordpress.com/2012/08/14/water-oscillators/"
