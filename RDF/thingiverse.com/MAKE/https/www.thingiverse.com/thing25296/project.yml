function: "Derived from Chris Connors' Mendocino Motor, this is a Make Labs modified version that was published in the pages of MAKE magazine vol. 31. Now with a mini propeller to put on the motor's shaft! \r\n\r\nThe Mendocino Motor floats in its own magnetic field and converts light into electricity and magnetism, which are then converted into the motion of the motor. It provides the satisfaction of creating an amazing bit of technology, and the opportunity to explore magnetism, electromagnetism, electric motors, solar power generation, and personal manufacturing."
