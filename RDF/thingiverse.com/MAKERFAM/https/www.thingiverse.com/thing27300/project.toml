My daughter will be doing a week of ArduSat space science in 2013 when this launches (proud Dad).\r\n\r\nFor space science enthusiasts, see the links below for more background on the ArduSat project:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space?ref=live\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/NanoSatisfi/307866409295499\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nanosatisfi?feature=watch"
