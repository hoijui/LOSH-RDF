function = "This is a 3D model of a squirrel that I found on Aim@Shape [1]. It was uploaded by MPII and is actually under the MPII Institute License, which you can view by clicking on the download link on the things page at Aim@shape.  \nI flattened the base and cleaned up some artifacts on the tail that I'm guessing were the result of scanning.  \nThis is the most work I've ever done on a model (I used Netfabb and Blender to clean it), so I learned a lot, and he came out very cute. My print came before I caught an error in the model, which caused the bandana looking line. It slices correctly now.  \n[1] http://shapes.aimatshape.net/view.php?id=105"
