    okh:function """I wanted to upgrade my Thing-o-Matic to linear bearings, so I started to look around at replacement parts. I quickly found MakeALot's X carriage (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9420) and planned to build it.\r
\r
But as I continued to look around at other parts, I found emmett's Truly Automatic Thing-O-Matic (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20383) and really liked the idea of being able to fix some of the issues with the ABP and have the ability to quickly put it on using tomlombardi's Quick Change Build Platform (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14747).\r
\r
But that platform didn't use linear bearings, and no one had a version that did. So I decided to see what I could do.\r
\r
The original Quick Change Build Platform files were made in Solidworks, which I neither own nor know how to use. So I used Netfabb Basic to take a ton of measurements, and re-created the platform in OpenSCAD. With that done, I cut out areas to hold four LM6UU linear bearings and enough space that it should be possible to get snap rings onto them to hold them in place.\r
\r
I compared my shape and the original and they are nearly perfect matches, so this should fit just fine. After installing linear bearings on my bot I decided I didn't like the noise, so never ended up printing this.""" ;
