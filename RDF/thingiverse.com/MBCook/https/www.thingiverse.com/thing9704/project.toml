function = "I've been starting to print raftless, but I was having a terrible time adjusting the M3 nuts on my HBP to get it level and flat. My needle nose pliers don't fit in my ToM well and I didn't want to keep taking the X platform off just to make small adjustments. I was about to search Amazon to find a small wrench when I realized I could make my own!\r\n\r\nThe file is parametric. Fill in the width of your nut (the STL file is set for an M3), the thickness (the wrench will be 20% thicker) and you'll get a nice wrench.\r\n\r\nFor bonus fun, you can set the size smaller and the wrench comes out pretty cute. If you set the nut diameter to something like 4.2 (which I did by accident) it looks great but is still pretty tiny."
