    okh:function """I've been starting to print raftless, but I was having a terrible time adjusting the M3 nuts on my HBP to get it level and flat. My needle nose pliers don't fit in my ToM well and I didn't want to keep taking the X platform off just to make small adjustments. I was about to search Amazon to find a small wrench when I realized I could make my own!\r
\r
The file is parametric. Fill in the width of your nut (the STL file is set for an M3), the thickness (the wrench will be 20% thicker) and you'll get a nice wrench.\r
\r
For bonus fun, you can set the size smaller and the wrench comes out pretty cute. If you set the nut diameter to something like 4.2 (which I did by accident) it looks great but is still pretty tiny.""" ;
