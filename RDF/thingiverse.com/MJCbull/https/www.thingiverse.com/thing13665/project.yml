function: This was a test file for me to attempt to transfer a file from sketchup into an svg so i could laser cut it. It was quite successful after discovering the plugin Slicemodeler designed by TIG. So, making it in sketchup i ran it through gimp so it could be generated into a jpeg and exported into roland cut studio from which i sliced it.
