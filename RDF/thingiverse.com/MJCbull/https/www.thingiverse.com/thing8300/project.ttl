    okh:function "These pieces were designed to fit inside the inner ring of a CD.The hole in the middle of both pieces are the correct size to snuggly fit a pencil through. The piece in the back fits the disc better than the one closer in the picture. This is still in the process of being worked on, but i have managed to make mine functional for a rat trap car project usign the pencil as an axel for cd wheels. This piece obviously could have other uses though. I have printed these pieces with multiple colors and have had issues with the density differences among them. Some are thicker, some are thinner. I have yet to find the perfect one." ;
