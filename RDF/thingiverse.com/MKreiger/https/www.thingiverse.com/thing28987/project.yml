function: "Revised from ASTM Tensile Test Specimen @ thingiverse.com/thing:13694\r\n\r\nThe change for this specimen is an added cylinder on one corner to create a starting/end point for the layers. This tensile specimen is for a current research project & is associated with benefits for anyone who wishes to collaborate by contributing sets of 10 of tensile specimen.\r\n\r\nThis a specimen for tensile testing in accordance with ASTM D638 \"Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Plastics\". It is a Type 1 specimen to be made from rigid plastic.\r\n\r\nTensile testing of RepRap printed specimens is being performed at the Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology Research Group http://www.mse.mtu.edu/~pearce/Index.html. Specific information about the testing can be found here www.appropedia.org/Mechanical_testing_of_polymer_components_made_with_the_RepRap_3-D_printer."
