print it - srew it on - put it on a cup or another bottle and let it drain\r

###dimensions###\r
outer diameter of bottle thread: 26.65mm\r
inner thread diameter: 24,4mm\r
thread pitch: 4mm\r
thread length: 13mm (25mm for bottle-bottle)\r

groove for cup (bottle to cup version):\r
outer: 91mm\r
inner: 81mm\r

If you're asking yourself why I designed 2 parts instead of one which fullfils both jobs: if I would have made the thread of the bottle->cup 25mm you would have drops of your liquid in the thread when draining in a cup... ;-)""" ;
