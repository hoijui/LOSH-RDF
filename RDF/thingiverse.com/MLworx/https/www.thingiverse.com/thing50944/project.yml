function: "Ever tried to completely drain a bottle with a low viscous fluid (e.g. silicone -> expensive!)?\r\n\r\nprint it - srew it on - put it on a cup or another bottle and let it drain\r\n\r\n###dimensions###\r\nouter diameter of bottle thread: 26.65mm\r\ninner thread diameter: 24,4mm\r\nthread pitch: 4mm\r\nthread length: 13mm (25mm for bottle-bottle)\r\n\r\ngroove for cup (bottle to cup version):\r\nouter: 91mm\r\ninner: 81mm\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're asking yourself why I designed 2 parts instead of one which fullfils both jobs: if I would have made the thread of the bottle->cup 25mm you would have drops of your liquid in the thread when draining in a cup... ;-)"
