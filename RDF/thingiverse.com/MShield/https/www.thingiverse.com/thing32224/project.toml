function = "This is a wall hanger for an Envi wall heater (http://www.envi-heat.com/). It has holes for a standard wood screw if you want to permanently mount one. However it is really sized to use Scotch Command Strips (http://www.command.com/), which allows me to remove the heater and hangers in the off season."
