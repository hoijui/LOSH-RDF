function: I recently got access to a laser cutter, so I was pretty excited to try this out. Cutting it was a learning experience in a few ways, but mostly about learning how to manipulate dxf files. The attached file is the file I used to do the cut. The box in blue is 2 feet by 4 feet, the size of the cutter I use.
