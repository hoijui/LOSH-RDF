function: "Look, I don't smoke, and I don't want people smoking around me. So I find it annoying that I can't buy a car with no lighters. I asked at my car dealership, and those plastic plugs cost 30 bucks! So here's my attempt to put Audi out of business.\r\n\r\nThis has not been printed or tested yet. I may have it go too deep, it may be too hard to pull out, etc...\r\n\r\nrev 1: I realised I used diameters where I needed radii. so its now narrower. Also, i made it hollow, so it'll use less plastic."
