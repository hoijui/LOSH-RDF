function = "A few months ago, I read on rep-rap.org about a design for an extruder that used plastic pellets rather than filaments. An auger drove the pellets into the hot end. That auger was made using copper wire and some pipe, but I thought it would be a good idea to make a printable one... And then I forgot about it.\r\n\r\nRecently, I was walking down Roncesvalles, which has been undergoing massive roadwork for about 2 years now. Across the street from my butcher was a machine for extruding road curbs in cement. At the part where the cement is fed into the machine, there was a large exposed auger... So I took a closer look, and it was in segments that were clearly bolted together. I thought: PRINTABLE!"
