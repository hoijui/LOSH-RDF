I tried again. When the first attempt failed, I peeled off all the RTV and it turned out I had put about 1/16 inch of insulation on it... I redid it, this time making sure I applied it thicker. I also did about 3 passes. I have much closer to a quarter inch of RTV on it, and its printing well. As I type this, I've been printing for 1 hour, 23 minutes without the shutoff kicking in, and the M3s through the acrylic are not too hot to touch. Neither is the RTV.\r

*update*\r
So far, so bad. It really didn't insulate enough. My ToM heated up and ran for a few minutes (maybe 10) before the safety shut-off cut out. Its weird because it seemed to me that the insulation itself wasn't too hot. To my finger, it was cooler than the extrusion tip. Looks like I need more, or a different silicone, assuming it can be done with silicone at all.\r
*end update*\r
\r
I started building the new hot end, and decided I didn't like the insulation. its the least professional bit, imho. So I went looking for an alternative. This is my first try: RTV. Its good up to 370C and vulcanizes, as it sets, in 24 hours.\r

Ok, so it doesn't look any better, but its mine, ya know?""" ;
