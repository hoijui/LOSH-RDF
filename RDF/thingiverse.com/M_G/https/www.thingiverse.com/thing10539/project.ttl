\r
This OpenSCAD script will generate a simple replacement button for an Oven-Grill-Hob/Oven-Broiler-Range\r
\r
To Do:\r
add support structure to aid printing\r
\r
Warning:\r
This structure is far narrower than you should really attempt to print with a Makerbot/Reprap style printer\r
If you do attempt to print this you will need some external support and possibly to print several of them at once or else enable cooling\r
\r
Changes from previous versions:\r
\r
0.2\r
 - 	moved code to a module\r
 - 	added array generation and flip ability\r
\r
0.1\r
 - 	first attempt\r
\r
Attention:\r
I did not design this part, it is from a commercial object but I did create this model of it based on my own observations and measurements. Do with this what you will but I would like some credit for the modelling of this part""" ;
