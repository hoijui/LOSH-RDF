function = "This OpenSCAD script prints a WIMU holder for the WIMU defined in 2011-08-16_Alex_WIMUv3_tyndall_generic_device_packaging_v1.3.scad\r\nThe file is parametric and allows you to choose all relevant variables:\r\nLength, breadth, corner radius and fit tolerance of device to be held.\r\nWidth, thickness and tolerance or belt/strap used. Holder height, thickness, separation between locations & desired loop hole axis/axes.\r\n\r\nSeveral .stl versions are given below with loops on the short, long and both axes\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n0.8.4\r\n\r\nDate:\r\n2012-02-23\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nyou will need the mouse_ears_test.scad file in the same folder for the mouse ears to compile with the version 0.4 and above .scad file properly\r\nYou will need \"WIMUv3_v1.5_2011-11-28_tyndall_generic_device_packaging_v1.4stacked.st\" in the same folder for the ghost of the held WIMU package to appear correctly\r\nDimensions beyond version 0.4 file have been changed to match the most recent version of the packaging found here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14298 i.e. 30.6x32.5x38.5mm\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\n\r\nv0.8.4\r\n - \tadded locating arms to help attach top and bottom halves\r\n - \tfixed position of base of cap to allow it to be printed\r\n - \tleft covers over cutouts to help with printability\r\n - \treduced print volume of cap using 3d cross shaped difference\r\n - \tfixed tiny elevation error for cap\r\nv0.8.3\r\n - \tadded cap\r\nv0.8.2\r\n - \tadjusted tolerances to get better fit\r\n - \tinternal cutout size now correctly defined using twice the tolerance value\r\nv0.8.1\r\n - \tfixed code so that north and south cutout locations were swapped to make sense\r\n - \tresized east hole to fit switch and moved south\r\n - \tvariant for Kieran with strap holes on both axes, 28*3mm, holes for USB and switch, total height 16mm\r\n - \tadded WIMU packaging ghost via .stl import to check location of cutouts\r\nv0.8\r\n - \tadded ability to make cutouts in walls around held objects\r\n - \tAdded cutout for access to uUSB port on Tyndall WIMUv3 device\r\n - \tCleaned up code a bit\r\nv0.7.1\r\n - \tVariant made for Damien with loops on both Axes and low profile\r\nv0.7\r\n - \treduced tolerance on corners from 0.45-0.1\r\nv0.6\r\n - \tincreased tolerance from 0.3-0.45\r\nv0.5\r\n - \tchanged held item dimensions to take account of manufacturing and assembly tolerance i.e. 31.04 32.7 38.66\r\n - \tincreased tolerance from 0.2 - 0.3\r\nv0.4\r\n - \tadded mouse ears\r\n - \tchanged held item dimensions to those of mass produced SLA clear resin WIMUv3 Packaging i.e. 30.6 32.5 38.5\r\n - \tBegan process of fixing up/replaceing old rounded cuboid method\r\nv0.3\r\n - \tadded ability to turn on or off loops on long or short axis and automatically adjust ext_l_holder & ext_b_holder in response\r\n - \tremoved the long axis loop holes\r\n - \tdecreased loop holes size from 30mm->1\" wide belt\r\nv0.2\r\n - \tchanged belt thickness 2->3\r\n - \tadded loop holes on short axis\r\nv 0.1\r\n - \tFirst attempt"
