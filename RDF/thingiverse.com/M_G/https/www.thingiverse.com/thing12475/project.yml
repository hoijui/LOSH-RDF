function: "A cutting template for making covers for the 4 sides of your Thing-o-Matic 3D printer. These can be easily made using A4 sheets of printer transparencies (overhead projector sheets) and a standard 2 hole office hole punch.\r\n\r\nCovering the sides of your printer is not just an aesthetic feature either, it can help improve print quality by keeping in heat and keeping out draughts.\r\n\r\nBy helping keep heat within the body of the printer, the time taken to reach printing temperature is slightly reduced and less strain is placed on the heating elements which may help preserve their lifespan.\r\n\r\nBy helping keep out draughts a more even and consistent temperature can be maintained we can reduce issues associated with uneven cooling such as weak inter layer bonding, cracking, lifting of the base etc. \r\n\r\nThis has been crucial in getting consistent results from our printer as the building we are based in is old and occasionally quite breezy."
