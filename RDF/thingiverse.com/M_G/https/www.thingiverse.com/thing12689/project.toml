function = "Spreadsheet based tool to help convert between the various ring size system (e.g. US+Can, UK+IE+AUS+NZ, IND+CHN, Swiss)and allow you to calculate the ring internal diameter in mm. Also gives linear best fit equations based on data found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_size\r\n\r\nPotentially very useful when combined with the following:\r\nRing Creation Script thingiverse.com/thing:12448\r\nDiamond size shape weight conversion Spreadsheet thingiverse.com/thing:12586\r\nRing metal cost calculator thingiverse.com/thing:12589\r\nfor costing a custom engagement ring or other such tomfoolery.\r\n\r\nNote: A table allowing you to convert between all the different sizing systems is now provided. These converted values are provided as indications only!!! If a size doesn't exist in a system it rounds up to the next available size. Also beware of very small or large sizes as the different systems donâ€™t start and end ant the same points. Check with a professional/the wearer before committing your time/money/etc. to an actual ring. I take no responsibility for incorrectly entered values, erroneous formulae, changes in finger size over time, weight gain/loss or the weather."
