function: "Spreadsheet based tool to help convert between the various ring size system (e.g. US+Can, UK+IE+AUS+NZ, IND+CHN, Swiss)and allow you to calculate the ring internal diameter in mm. Also gives linear best fit equations based on data found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_size\r\n\r\nPotentially very useful when combined with the following:\r\nRing Creation Script thingiverse.com/thing:12448\r\nDiamond size shape weight conversion Spreadsheet thingiverse.com/thing:12586\r\nRing metal cost calculator thingiverse.com/thing:12589\r\nfor costing a custom engagement ring or other such tomfoolery.\r\n\r\nNote: A table allowing you to convert between all the different sizing systems is now provided. These converted values are provided as indications only!!! If a size doesn't exist in a system it rounds up to the next available size. Also beware of very small or large sizes as the different systems don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t start and end ant the same points. Check with a professional/the wearer before committing your time/money/etc. to an actual ring. I take no responsibility for incorrectly entered values, erroneous formulae, changes in finger size over time, weight gain/loss or the weather."
