function: "Current Version: 1.4\r\nDate: 2013-02-20\r\nI am required to write documentation for equipment and devices I build and design so that others can use them proficiently. Hence, here is a formatted sheet which you can fill with information specific to your printer such as Equipment Description, Person Responsible, Authorised Users, Expected Performance & Settings.\r\n\r\nI keep mine in an A4 clear folder sheet on the side of the printer so no-one has any excuse for not having access to the correct settings.\r\n\r\nNote: This A4 clear folder sheet also serves as 1 of the sides parts of the Thing-o-Matic Side Panel Plastic Covers http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12475\r\n\r\nSome samples are provided (the filenames that end in \"A.doc\") and the most recent blank template (filename ends in \"Ablank.doc\"). I hope this will be of some use to you."
