    okh:function """I am required to write documentation for equipment and devices I build and design so that others can use them proficiently. Hence, here is another section of my Work-in-Progress Thing-o-Matic 3D Printer Manual, dealing with Post-Processing of Printed Items such as the following:\r
\r
Removing Parts â€“ Taking the object from the printer and separating individual parts or structures\r
Cleaning-up Parts â€“ Removing rafts, support structures and â€œstringsâ€\r
Refining Features â€“ Resizing holes, rounding edges and sharpening details\r
Assembly â€“ Combining printed and non-printed parts\r
Finishing â€“ Mechanically filing, sanding and polishing as well as chemically or heat treating objects to improve the surface finish\r
\r
To Do:\r
Add pictures\r
Add section on heat treating of parts\r
Add safety gear recommendations\r
Add details for PLA (at the moment it in only based on my personal experience with ABS)""" ;
