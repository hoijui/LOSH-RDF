function = "Most of my acrylic parts have been slightly cracked but stable for a long time. However since I got an MK6 Stepper and have begun ratcheting up the speeds these cracks seem to have grown... One acrylic extruder plate broke the other day (thankfully the MK6 upgrade kit came with a spare). So here are some quickly generated drop-in replacement printable .STL part files for the \"Rainbow bridge\" that supports the MK5/6 extruder. A more printer compatible support design could be made but the convenience of drop in replacement parts should not be over looked!\r\n\r\nOh, note that the largest part comes in 2 halves that lock together like jigsaw pieces. I would recommend gluing or acetoning these together.\r\n\r\nAlso, the narrow slots beneath the nut holes are for M3 washers as otherwise I feel the nut will get pulled into the plastic if you over tighten it.\r\n\r\nTo completely replace your Rainbow bridge you will need:\r\n2x replacement_rainbow_bridge_V1.1_A.stl\r\n2x replacement_rainbow_bridge_V1.1_B.stl\r\n2x replacement_rainbow_bridge_V1.1_cross_brace.stl\r\n1x replacement_rainbow_bridge_V1.1_left_foot\r\n1x replacement_rainbow_bridge_V1.1_right_foot\r\n1x replacement_rainbow_bridge_V1.1_top"
