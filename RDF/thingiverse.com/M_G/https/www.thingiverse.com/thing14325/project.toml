function = "This requires the makerbot 3d scanner \"cyclops\" kit. It does not allow derivatives but it is located here... http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4271\r\n\r\nSorry for poor documentation but the text and photos should be sufficient for those who are interested.\r\n\r\nThese printed parts are used to help the Optoma PK201 Pico Projector fit into the laser cut plywood housing of the Makerbot Cyclops 2.0 3D Scanner.\r\n\r\nThe wheel part allows you to adjust the focus of the projector whil it is in it's housing. It needs to have a rubber band or o-ring placed around it to give it sufficient grip though.\r\n\r\nThe cube part is placed against the bottom right rear corner of the scanner as you look into the lens, and acts to keep the rear of the projector in the correct location.\r\n\r\nSome modifications are needed to the laser cut plywood parts too to accommodate the non-standard projector and these additional pieces. The hole on the rear panel needs to be enlarged, a hole for a bolt to hold the   3D printed focus wheel needs to be made in the bottom panel, a wide slot on the right panel needs to be made for the edge of the focus wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bolt hole for the focus wheel is 3mm in diameter with its centre 26mm from the front edge and 10mm from the left edge of the bottom panel \r\nThe slot on the left panel is 8*30mm with its bottom left corner located 20mm above the bottom edge and 13mm from the left edge.\r\n\r\nThe enlarged slot on the rear panel is 20*62mm with it's bottom left corner located 13mm above the bottom edge and 32mm from the left edge.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to enlarge the hole in the front of the device to allow the lens from the pico projector to project properly. The hole should be rectangular about 20*15mm starting 18mm from the bottom edge and 45mm from the left edge of the front panel."
