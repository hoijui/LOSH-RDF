    okh:function """This OpenSCAD script will generate a single part rack for mounting multiple double-stacked 25x25mm Radio->USB "base station" PCB units. This allows the units to be easily slid into the enclosure where they will be held securely by friction and locked in place by micro-USB plugs which attach at the side. These racks will be acetone-welded into commercial ABS enclosures for a professional looking, low-cost and secure medium scale technology build.\r
\r
This would be of use to someone who wants a modular system for securing multiple stacked PCBs within a larger enclosure in such a way that they can be readily removed.\r
\r
Changes from previous versions:\r
v0.7\r
 - 	simple single stack versions for pole attached units\r
 - 	decrease thickness of layer separator or increase width of cutouts on each side by 0.2mm (measured gap after printing probably due to tolerancing etc.)\r
 - 	add cutouts on bottom to help with sanding runners smooth (sized for standard nail file/emory board width of 12mm\r
v0.6\r
 - 	use rounded cuboid for USB plug cutout to attempt to prevent roof from falling in\r
v0.5\r
 - 	fixed cutout for USB above thicker shorter section by placing difference operation across entire union operation\r
v0.4\r
 - 	added support to thicker section to help it print properly at large z values\r
 - 	added cap and cutout for USB above thicker shorter section\r
v0.3\r
 - 	added support to thin section to help it print properly at large z values\r
v0.2 2011-12-13\r
 - 	make base thinner\r
 - 	make tray walls taller\r
 - 	remove tray lip\r
 - 	a 4 base station unit with mouse ears in a hollow cuboid tray\r
v0.1 2011-12-13\r
 - 	first attempt a 2 base station unit with mouse ears in a hollow cuboid tray""" ;
