function: "This OpenSCAD script will generate a single part rack for mounting multiple double-stacked 25x25mm Radio->USB \"base station\" PCB units. This allows the units to be easily slid into the enclosure where they will be held securely by friction and locked in place by micro-USB plugs which attach at the side. These racks will be acetone-welded into commercial ABS enclosures for a professional looking, low-cost and secure medium scale technology build.\r\n\r\nThis would be of use to someone who wants a modular system for securing multiple stacked PCBs within a larger enclosure in such a way that they can be readily removed.\r\n\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\nv0.7\r\n - \tsimple single stack versions for pole attached units\r\n - \tdecrease thickness of layer separator or increase width of cutouts on each side by 0.2mm (measured gap after printing probably due to tolerancing etc.)\r\n - \tadd cutouts on bottom to help with sanding runners smooth (sized for standard nail file/emory board width of 12mm\r\nv0.6\r\n - \tuse rounded cuboid for USB plug cutout to attempt to prevent roof from falling in\r\nv0.5\r\n - \tfixed cutout for USB above thicker shorter section by placing difference operation across entire union operation\r\nv0.4\r\n - \tadded support to thicker section to help it print properly at large z values\r\n - \tadded cap and cutout for USB above thicker shorter section\r\nv0.3\r\n - \tadded support to thin section to help it print properly at large z values\r\nv0.2 2011-12-13\r\n - \tmake base thinner\r\n - \tmake tray walls taller\r\n - \tremove tray lip\r\n - \ta 4 base station unit with mouse ears in a hollow cuboid tray\r\nv0.1 2011-12-13\r\n - \tfirst attempt a 2 base station unit with mouse ears in a hollow cuboid tray"
