\r
This OpenSCAD script will generate a 2 part holder to attach a Tyndall WIMUv3 to the upright square cross-sectional posts on the moveable sled part of the assassin trainer at Bath University. The size of the bar it is attached to can be parametrically varied\r
\r
Version: 0.9\r
Date: 2012-05-31\r
\r
Todo:\r
 - 	clean up code to make more parametric\r
 - 	test fit and adjust\r
 - 	add "wiggle" for bolts and captured nuts\r
 - 	add option to choose orientation of WIMU holder section\r
 - 	add optional corner fins to prevent thermal stress cracks when printing in black ABS\r
 \r
Warnings:\r
None\r
\r
Note:\r
You will need to also have the modules mouse_ears_test.scad, pivot_1_0.scad and rounded_cuboid_v2.4.scad in the same directory or your library for this to compile correctly\r
\r
Changes from previous versions:\r
0.9\r
 - 	added option to choose position of hinge/bolt holes along sides\r
 - 	added second captive nut section on side for tightening holder to bar\r
0.8\r
 - 	added tolerancing for bar fit\r
 - 	added second bolt pivot\r
0.7\r
 - 	added padding partial cutout between Z axis of wimu and front/top face of wimu holder\r
 - 	added variable for and increased pivot size around hinge pin to 5\r
 - 	added extra mouse ears under wimu holder in attempt to prvent it from curling etc.\r
 - 	increased height of wimu by 0.8 mm as previously printed item despite having a nominal .stl measured height of 31.4 it measured only 30.2 when printed also note average height of 5 wimus measured was 31mm\r
0.6\r
 - 	increased size of side holes to allow for viewing of status LEDs\r
 - 	changed the size of cutouts on WIMU holder section to help with removal of WIMU\r
 - 	added cutout under WIMU holder to help with removal of WIMU\r
 - 	added captive nut section for tightening holder to bar\r
0.5\r
 - 	added WIMU packaging to check location of cutouts\r
0.4\r
 - 	Adjusted position of cutouts around hinge and bolt clamp so that they dont go all the way through the wall to make for easier printing and drilling\r
 - 	Made hinge pin larger to make it easier to insert hinge pin without drilling\r
0.3\r
 - 	Added option to add device holder on side or not using use_holder variable\r
 - 	Fixed large clamp part so that it has correct internal dimensions\r
 - 	Increased height of small cutouts on long side of WIMU hodler so that activity LED can be seen\r
 - 	added comments\r
 - 	Moved everything up onto the build plane\r
 - 	Fixed some translate issues where bar_stock_l and bar_stock_b were mixed up\r
 - 	Moved the hinge and bolt side cutouts so that a thin piece of material would connect the 2 halves\r
 - 	Moved the mouse ears into the union and differecne operations applied to the main clamp body\r
0.2\r
 - 	reduced individual parts count by using the pivot module only twice and using cut lines to split it up\r
0.1\r
 - 	First attempt""" ;
