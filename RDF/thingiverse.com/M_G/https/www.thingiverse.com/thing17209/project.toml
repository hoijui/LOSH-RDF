function = "Someone I know is hand-making a game that uses hexagonal pieces. They are using epoxy modelling clay and other miniature figure making materials. When I saw they were cutting the bases by hand I offered to print simple plastic bases for them or make a convenient hexagon \"cookie-cutter\" so that they would line up with each other better. These pieces are 33mm along a side or 66mm from two opposite points... so they are smaller than Catan pieces (which are 45mm on a side and 90mm across BTW), however as the script is parametric it could be modified to make compatible tiles.\r\n\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\n0.3\r\n - \tAdded proper comments and cleaned up code\r\n - \tImplemented Parametric Variables\r\n0.2\r\n - \tswitched to using 6 sided conical frustrum\r\n0.1\r\n - \tFirst attempt using extruded 6-sided polygon"
