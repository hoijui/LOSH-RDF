    okh:function """A simple 2 part packaging to allow one of our Wireless Inertial Measurement Units to be used as a 6 sided die.\r
\r
Version: 0.4\r
Date: 2012-02-23\r
\r
To do:\r
add option to add mouse-ears to prevent curling during printing\r
fix bottom positioning bugs in rounded cuboid 2.6 module when switching from cylinder-sphere type\r
\r
Warning:\r
Printing the rounded edges on the bottom face is not easy with a makerbot type machine, support structures can be added but this will require removal with a sharp knife/dremel etc. be careful!\r
None \r
\r
Changes from previous versions:\r
0.4\r
 - 	used cross shaped module and difference to make printed object use less material\r
0.3\r
 - 	added pips to each face and supports to hold electronics safely within dice\r
0.2\r
 - 	a simple side by side 2 part hollow rounded cube with interlocking lips to hold them together\r
0.1\r
 - 	first attempt, just a simple cube+sphere minkowski operation\r
Warning: There are definitely a few bugs in the rounded cuboid 2.6 file. Also it will take a long time to generate the first time (up to 10 minutes on an old Pentium 4 machine) as minkowski sums with spheres are very cumbersome\r
\r
Also I have attached a screenshot of a Labview GUI that calculates which side of the dice is facing up.""" ;
