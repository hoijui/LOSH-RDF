function: "A simple 2 part packaging to allow one of our Wireless Inertial Measurement Units to be used as a 6 sided die.\r\n\r\nVersion: 0.4\r\nDate: 2012-02-23\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\nadd option to add mouse-ears to prevent curling during printing\r\nfix bottom positioning bugs in rounded cuboid 2.6 module when switching from cylinder-sphere type\r\n\r\nWarning:\r\nPrinting the rounded edges on the bottom face is not easy with a makerbot type machine, support structures can be added but this will require removal with a sharp knife/dremel etc. be careful!\r\nNone \r\n\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\n0.4\r\n - \tused cross shaped module and difference to make printed object use less material\r\n0.3\r\n - \tadded pips to each face and supports to hold electronics safely within dice\r\n0.2\r\n - \ta simple side by side 2 part hollow rounded cube with interlocking lips to hold them together\r\n0.1\r\n - \tfirst attempt, just a simple cube+sphere minkowski operation\r\nWarning: There are definitely a few bugs in the rounded cuboid 2.6 file. Also it will take a long time to generate the first time (up to 10 minutes on an old Pentium 4 machine) as minkowski sums with spheres are very cumbersome\r\n\r\nAlso I have attached a screenshot of a Labview GUI that calculates which side of the dice is facing up."
