function = "A simple parametric wheel with 5 cutouts made in openscad. In my case it was used to form a piece to insert into the hollow within cardboard wire spools  so that they can fit on meccano axles.\r\nNeeded this as I made the mistake of buying unspooled plastic and once everything became a massive tangle realised I need a spool and somthing to help unfurl the plastic filament. Using a frame made out of mecanno and an empty carboard and aluminium spool from 24 gauge copper wire. This did work but wasn't ideal!\r\n\r\nThankfully now almost all my plastic is bought on spools and there is a purpose built holder for them all!"
