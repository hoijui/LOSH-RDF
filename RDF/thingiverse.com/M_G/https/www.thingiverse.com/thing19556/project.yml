function: "This OpenSCAD script creates a holder for an STM Gyro Eval Board that fits onto the moutign holes on a Gyro_Turntable_Mounting_Plate so that it can be tested on a high speed turntable\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nmay need to trim some stuff from the top of the cylindrical posts as there are many small components adjacent to the screw holes\r\n\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\nv0.4\r\n - \tremoved one of the bolt holes under devices\r\n - \tmake it thicker (from 3 to 5 mm) so it prints better\r\nv0.3\r\n - \tadjusted some values based on callipers based measurements of board\r\n - \tnow it should be realistically sized\r\nv0.2\r\n - \tremoved junk lines\r\n - \tadded cutouts\r\n - \trepositioned parts\r\n - \tadded minkowski sum to round out corners under PCB\r\n - \tmade it into a printable item\r\nv0.1\r\n - \tfirst attempt at laying out parts"
