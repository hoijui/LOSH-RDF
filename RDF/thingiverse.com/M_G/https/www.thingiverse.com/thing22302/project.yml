function: "This OpenSCAD script will generate an upgrade that allows the makerbot to hold a pen (or cutter or laser or drill or other tool) so it can be used as a plotter, this will hold the pen in place with elastic bands so that you don't need the unicorn upgrade or careful vertical alignment and levelling your build platform. Basically pen plotting will no longer be such a chore!\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 0.3\r\nDate: 2012-04-30 ISO Standard YYYY_MM_DD format\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\nadd option to add mouse-ears to prevent curling during printing\r\nadd option to have triangular supports at side of an addon piece for 3rd rear M5 bolt hole\r\nmake rubber band holes bigger!\r\nIncrease base thickness at ends or make glue-on covers for holding M5 nuts in place\r\n\r\nWarning:\r\nNone \r\n\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\n0.3\r\n - \tadded triangular support ribs to side of tower\r\n - \tproperly implemented maximum_pen_diameter\r\n - \tmade walls thicker and pen size larger after the printed holder of version 0.2 failed structurally around trapped nuts during assembly\r\n - \tchanged base shape to make more efficient use of material\r\n0.2\r\n - \tmoved bottom of all parts to build platform z=0 level\r\n - \trounded ends or main support bar\r\n - \tfixed one slightly large node\r\n - \tadjusted m3 nuts to be 2.1*nominal thread diameter\r\n - \tchanged variable names to reduce confusion/ambiguity\r\n - \tadded three square nodes on intelocking cylinders to further constrain motion\r\n - \tReplaced hard coded numbers with named variables\r\n - \trotated hexagonal cutouts on inside of holder to ensure 2-manifoldness and inmprove printability\r\n0.1\r\n - \tFirst attempt"
