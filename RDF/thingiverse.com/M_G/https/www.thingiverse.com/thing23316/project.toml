function = "A 3D mockup of a tantou (Japanese short-sword) I am making as a present for someone and an excuse to buy new tools and learn several new fabrication techniques.\r\n\r\nI plan on eventually building a forge and making the blade in the traditional manner myself. Before I do so I was advised to make it in wood, then aluminium, then plate steel before attempting to forge it from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe blade part (including tang) tend to be 1 tsuba (about 30cm or 12\") long and about 2.5cm 1\" wide and 8mm 1/3\" thick.\r\n\r\nAlthough intended for ritual suicide or personal protection they were often worn as fashion items.\r\n\r\nThe version shown here is an aikuchi type, where the handle, finger guard and scabbard are all flush with each other. These were more dangerous to use but easier to conceal.\r\n\r\nThe wooden version is progressing well!\r\n\r\nNote: all parts including new version 0.3 parts (From February 2013) are included in the zip file!"
