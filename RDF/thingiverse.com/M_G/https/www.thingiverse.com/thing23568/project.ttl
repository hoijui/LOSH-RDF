    okh:function """Many electronic items we make here have tiny little sliding switches for power etc. These are difficult to use with big clumsy fingers and generally when a device is packaged you need to poke a needle or paper clip through a tiny hole in the side near the switch or something similarly inconvenient to activate the switch. Or at least that is how it was until now...\r
\r
This is a simple parametric part that allows you to activate a switch. It can be made fit into a gap between a PCB and an enclosure with it's nub poking through the side of the casing and a slot on the rear catching the much smaller nub of e.g. a small surface mount switch. There should be enough clearance between all sides on the pcb and enclosure for it run reasonably smoothly, also ensure there is enough room at the ends to allow the switch the move along its full length of travel!\r
\r
I've used it in several enclosures and devices to make it easier to turn things on and off.\r
\r
See the picture for an example (the switch catch is the dark grey part)""" ;
