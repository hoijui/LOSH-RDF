This is a part to hold an RF transmission line in the centre of a tube as part of a radio experiment apparatus prototype that is being built here. Nothing complicated, just putting it up here in case it is needed in future and to show that not all designs need to be complicated, well planned, versioned etc. to be an essential part of something incredibly complex. In many ways that is the beauty of low cost 3d printing, exactly what you need made as soon as you realise you need it!""" ;
