    okh:function """OpenSCAD parametric script to generate a basket for holding de-humidifying crystals of the type used in home chemical dehumidifiers\r
I bought several dehumidifiers over the years to prevent mold and mildew from growing in spots around teh house but initially everytime I buy one I was throwing away a lot of plastic waste!\r
Eventually  I found a refillable that takes large tablets of CaCl... however I haven't seen the correct sized tablets for sale since I bought it.\r
I am loathe to buy more plastic non-refillable dehumidifiers just to throw them out after one use.,Eventually I found the loose CaCl cyrstals but I could only pour in a small amount beforethey would fall through the holes in all the previous plastic dehumidifiers I bought.\r
So this basket is designed to be the same size as the refill tablets that fit the previously mentioned refillable chemical dehumidifier. It has lots of narrow slots and holes to allow humid air in and dripping water out, while being narrow enough to keep the crystals in (I hope). It also has a refill hole at the top to fill it with cyrstals once they are gone.\r
Perhaps this will be of use to someone else out there???\r

Version: 0.1\r
\r
Date: 2012-06-08 ISO Standard YYYY_MM_DD format\r
\r
To do:\r
add a lip to each half to help it click together so that it holds together well during gluing or perhaps so that use of glue can be avoided\r
\r
Warning:\r
I am not sure if CaCl crystals will react with whatever plastic you use and have not yet tested this out\r
I have added a thin layer of plastic inside all the cutotus to make it easier to print , if you do not want this then set cutout_cover_t & base_cutout to 0\r
\r
Changes from previous versions:\r
0.1\r
 - 	First attempt\r
 - 	simple 2 part basket with narrow slots on side and radiating slots on base/top. A refill hole is present on the side.\r
