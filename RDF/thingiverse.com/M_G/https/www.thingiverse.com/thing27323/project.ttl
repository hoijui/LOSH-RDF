    okh:function """This OpenSCAD script will generate a 3-5 part hinged clamp which can be used to attach things to pipes or round bars such as handlebars, pencils, canes etc. It also features a mount for a tripod using the lug washer and bolt hardware supplied with the Makerbot Cyclops 3D scanner kit\r
\r
The script is highly parametric but does require you to pull in some premade .stl's at present and is currently sized for 18mm diameter wooden dowel and a cheap Kendo-s200 tripod at present\r
\r
Mouse ears can be added to the base part easily by changing a boolean control variable\r
\r
This is currently being used as part of a wireless sensor network base-station design.\r
