    okh:function """This OpenSCAD script will generate a 2D shape based on two partially overlapping ellipses\r
The radii of both ellipses are controlled by specifying the final width and height of the created shape as well of the ratio of the depths of each side\r
there is also an option for rounding the shape while preserving it's dimensions with controllable radius\r

Version: 1.3\r

\r
Todo:\r
\r
Warning:\r
If band_depth > band_width the alignments might not work correctly\r
If rounding_rad is large compared to band_depth or band_width the shape may just generate as a circle\r
\r
Changes from previous versions:\r
\r
v1-3\r
 - 	added abilty to optionally create 3d lienar/rotate extrusion\r
v1-2\r
 - 	Some more control over centre and rounding in preparation for integration into ring creation script\r
 - 	Fixed some alignment issues\r
 - 	Made compatible with "Customizer"\r
v1-1\r
 - 	uses formula for an arc taken from here http://www.mathopenref.com/arcradius.html\r
\r
v1-0\r
 - 	uses intersection of somewhat arbitrarily sized circles minkowski using a smaller circle for rounding off to prove concept""" ;
