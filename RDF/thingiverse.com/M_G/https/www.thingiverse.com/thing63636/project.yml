function: "This OpenSCAD script will generate a 2D shape based on two partially overlapping ellipses\r\nThe radii of both ellipses are controlled by specifying the final width and height of the created shape as well of the ratio of the depths of each side\r\nthere is also an option for rounding the shape while preserving it's dimensions with controllable radius\r\n\r\nAuthor: Mark Gaffney\r\nVersion: 1.3\r\nDate: 2013-03-19\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n\r\nWarning:\r\nIf band_depth > band_width the alignments might not work correctly\r\nIf rounding_rad is large compared to band_depth or band_width the shape may just generate as a circle\r\n\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\n\r\nv1-3\r\n - \tadded abilty to optionally create 3d lienar/rotate extrusion\r\nv1-2\r\n - \tSome more control over centre and rounding in preparation for integration into ring creation script\r\n - \tFixed some alignment issues\r\n - \tMade compatible with \"Customizer\"\r\nv1-1\r\n - \tuses formula for an arc taken from here http://www.mathopenref.com/arcradius.html\r\n\r\nv1-0\r\n - \tuses intersection of somewhat arbitrarily sized circles minkowski using a smaller circle for rounding off to prove concept"
