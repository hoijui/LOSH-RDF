function = "This OpenSCAD script will generate a 2 part fit together packaging for a device of user selectable size. Any amount of various shaped cutouts, support posts, engraved text and logos can be easily placed on any face using special array variables. Check out the instructions below as well as the examples and comments in the code for more information on how to use them.  \n\nAuthor: Mark Gaffney  \nVersion: 2.6c (versions d e & f are slight modifications for a specific item without proper controls but these will be included in v2.7)  \nDate: 2013-04-04  \n\nToDo:  \n\tadd user controllable flanges and interlocking lip features  \nWarning:  \n\tSome combinations of values, shapes and locations etc. may lead to an invalid or non-manifold shape beign created, preventing you from exporting a .stl  \n\tIf this happens try to remove or change some of the features or values until you get a valid shape and then add them back gradually until you find the offending item, then change it so it doesn't cause a problem  \n\t  \n\tNote: This thing uses  HarlanDMii's\"write.scad\" module http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16193  \n\twhich you will need to have downloaded and located in the directory if you want to run this on your PC  \n        The version I had did not properly implement spacing on 'writecube', a modified version that implements this is included here...  \n\t  \n\tGenerating text can be very slow!  \n\t  \n\tWhen generating a stacked layout it may look like the top is taller than it should be, this seems to be a visualisation bug in OpenSCAD, if you create a .STL it will be perfect  \n\nChanges from previous versions:  \n\nv2.6c  \n - \tImplemented ability to choose box shape i.e. \"cuboid\",\"rounded4sides\", \"rounded6sides\", \"chamfered6sides\"  \n - \tEnsured \"box_type\" module is used in generation of each box_half  \nv2.6b  \n - \tinvestigated and fixed some top lip mis alignment  \nv2.6  \n - \timplements loading external objects (such as .stl files) to place on faces  \n - \timplemented overlooked translation of text on faces from previous version  \n - \tfixed box_t in make_cutouts\t  \nv2.5 (AKA cutouts_on_faces_for_loop-v0_2.scad)  \n - \tImplement tolerancing of connection between 2 halves using lip_fit  \n - \timplement text on faces  \n - \tComplete documentation  \nv2.4 (AKA cutouts_on_faces_for_loop-v0_4.scad)  \n - \tuser provides device dimensions and internal clearance(s), packaging dimensions are calculated based on this  \n - \tpreparations to allow for different wall_t in x,y,z  \n - \timplement posts  \n - \tmouse ears work properly  \n - \t2 halves in \"beside\" layout joined by union  \n\nv2.3 2013-03-23 (AKA cutouts_on_faces_for_loop-v0_3.scad)  \n - \tfixed calls to make_box and half_box modules  \n - \tadded ability to handle \"holes\" array for making cutouts to make_box and half_box modules  \n - \tadded module for rounded cuboid  \n - \tfixed errors on rounded cuboid cutouts's use of a_bit  \n - \tfixed translate errors for making lips on box  \n - \tensured all parts generate on z=0  \n - \tgave top (greenish) and bottom (reddish) different colours for ease of identification  \n - \trotated top in \"beside\" layout to more intuitive orientation  \n - \tadded box cross module and included in hull calculations to ensure box sizes are exact even with low side count  \n - \tadded box_type module to allow choice of different shaped boxes or automatically swap them based on the current variables  \n - \tadded mouse_ears module  \n Note: In stacked mode you may notice the red half looks like it is the full length, this appears to be a visualisation bug in openscad, the part is generated correctly  \n\nv2.2 2013-03-22 (AKA cutouts_on_faces_for_loop-v0_2.scad)  \nbased on My own structure  \n - \tNew format [face_name, shape_name, shape_position[x_pos,y_pos,x_offs,y_offs,rotate,align], shape_size[depth,,,]]  \n - \t - \tface_name (\"N\", \"S\", \"E\", \"W\", \"T\", \"B\")  \n - \t - \tshape_name (\"Square\", \"Rectangle\" , \"Round_Rect\", \"Cylinder\", \"Ellipse\" , \"Cone\")  \n - \t - \tshape_position[x_pos,y_pos,x_offs,y_offs,rotate,align=(\"inside\" or \"outside\")]  \n - \t - \t - \t\"Square\" shape_size[depth, length_breadth]  \n - \t - \t - \t\"Rectangle\" shape_size[depth, length, breadth]  \n - \t - \t - \t\"Round_Rect\" shape_size[depth, length, breadth, corner_radius, corner_sides]  \n - \t - \t - \t\"Cylinder\" shape_size[depth, radius ,sides]  \n - \t - \t - \t\"Ellipse\" shape_size[depth, radius_length, radius_breadth, sides]  \n - \t - \t - \t\"Cone\" shape_size[[depth, radius_bottom, radius_top ,sides]  \n\n - \tpos_x and pos_y are chosen to align with views taken from the North, Top or East faces towards the origin so that they are aligned with [-x,+z], [+x,+y] & [+y,+z] respectively  \n - \trotation is clockwise about the plane of the North, Top or East faces as lookign towards the origin this means they are anticlockwise for the opposite faces(i.e. same convention as above)  \n - \tthese 2 conventiosn are chosen to make it easier to position cutouts that align with oppsite sides. e.g. a box that fits around a rotated ellipse pipe  \n\t  \nv2.1 2013-03-22 (AKA cutouts_on_faces_for_loop-v0_1.scad)  \n - based on kitlaan's array structure, supporting cones and rectangles  \n - from kitlaan's Customisable Electronic Device Packaging http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8607  \n - \t - \trect [ x-offset, y-offset, x-width, y-width, corner-radius, corner-sides, depth, rotate ]  \n - \t - \tcylinder [ x-offset, y-offset, inner-radius, outer-radius, sides, depth, rotate ]"
