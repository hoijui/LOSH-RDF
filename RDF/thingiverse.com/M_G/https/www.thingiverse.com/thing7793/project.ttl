\r
The heights of the smaller cuboids will alternate sequentially.\r
The user can specify the number of rows & columns as well as the length & breadth of the smaller cuboids and the separation between adjacent cuboids.\r
The Number of different heights and the difference in height between smaller cuboids can be specified too.\r
The user can also choose whether or not to add Keyed connectors so that they can print multiple items that can then be easily connected together to for an arbitrarily large grid\r
The overall effect will be like the tread pattern of a mountain bike tyre or a 3D checker board.""" ;
