function: "The battery in my calipers (V303 size) was about to die... but I had no suitable replacement at hand. I did have a box of smaller button cells (V393) that no-one was using anymore. All I had to do was make something to fill in the extra space and keep the smaller battery pressed against the side and bottom contacts. A simple crescent should do!\r\n\r\nFor a more generic button cell adapter script check out http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8413\r\n\r\nNOTE: Parts of this file lie below z=0, this file needs to be moved onto the platform before printing!
