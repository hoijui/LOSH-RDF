function = "This thing provides a way of easily attaching a packaged electronics device to your shoelaces or various other locations. A large rounded rectagular prism cutout holds the packaged device in the centre, at the base of this there are \"arms\" that spread out from the central part with cutouts to pass laces over and a sharp egded raised lip to keep them there. This relies on a friction fit to keep the packaged device in place so if you find that yours is too loose you may need to pad it out with tape etc.\r\n\r\nIn this case it was used with the output of the Customisable Electronic Device Packaging script http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7658\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nyou will need the mouse_ears_test.scad file in the same folder for the mouse ears to compile with this file properly\r\n\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\n0.6\r\n - \treduced tolerance from 0.45-0.3\r\n0.5\r\n - \tFixed faulty internal breadth calculation to use held_item_b instead of held_item_h\r\n - \tNew module to handle strange shaped cutouts\r\n - \tCorrected lack of $fn variable in rounded_cuboid_2_3 module\r\n - \tReduced overall height (introducing new variable total_h=15) from 30.6-15\r\n - \tCleaned up code\r\n0.4\r\n - \treduced tolerance on corners from 0.45-0.1\r\n - \tincreased tolerance from 0.3-0.45\r\n - \tused newer implementation of rounded cuboid module\r\n0.3\r\n - \tadded mouse ears\r\n - \tchanged held item dimensions to those of mass produced SLA clear resin WIMUv3 Packaging i.e. 30.6 32.5 38.5\r\n0.2\r\n - \tadded cutout_radius variable\r\n0.1\r\n - \tFirst attempt"
