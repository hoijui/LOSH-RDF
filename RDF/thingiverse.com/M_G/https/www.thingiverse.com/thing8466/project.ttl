    okh:function """This thing provides a way of easily attaching a packaged electronics device to your shoelaces or various other locations. A large rounded rectagular prism cutout holds the packaged device in the centre, at the base of this there are "arms" that spread out from the central part with cutouts to pass laces over and a sharp egded raised lip to keep them there. This relies on a friction fit to keep the packaged device in place so if you find that yours is too loose you may need to pad it out with tape etc.\r
\r
In this case it was used with the output of the Customisable Electronic Device Packaging script http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7658\r
\r
Note:\r
you will need the mouse_ears_test.scad file in the same folder for the mouse ears to compile with this file properly\r
