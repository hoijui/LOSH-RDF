function: "This OpenSCAD script will generate a simple one piece fixture to hold a colleague's PV layer components i.e. PV cell, PCB and supercapacitor\r\n\r\nNOTE: Before v0.7 parts of this file lie below z=0, these files will need to be moved onto the platform before printing! Be careful if you decide to print this!\r\n\r\nI've got 30 of these guys to print!\r\n\r\nChanges from previous versions:\r\n2.1.0\r\n - \tVariant that prints a simple 2cm tall cap to cover the electronics part of the holder\r\n2.1\r\n - \tFixed some vlaues to place the support posts in corect location (up +1mm) scap leads Right +2mm\r\n - \tincreased post diameter for the two along one side slightly\r\n2.0\r\n - \tNew layout (PCB rotated 90Degrees) and larger SCAP\r\n - \tchange pcb_l 30->35 pcb_b 35->30\r\n - \tchange scap_l 23->20 scap_b 15->22 scap_h 5->10\r\n0.8\r\n -  add thin infill for hollow sections to improve printability\r\n0.7\r\n -  moved entire structure above z=0 plane (no longer a destroyer of belts)\r\n - \tadded mouse ears\r\n0.6\r\n - \tmade thinner\r\n - \tfixed incorrect measurements for PV panel\r\n0.5\r\n - \tAdded holes for wires between sections\r\n\r\n0.4\r\n - \tRemoved plastic from centre of pv area to speed up print\r\n\r\n0.3\r\n - \tFixed error with cutout translates due to misuse of separation and clearance variables\r\n - \tFixed error with second half of calculation of total _b using max() where I forgot to include separation\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n - \tAdded support posts\r\n\r\n0.1\r\n - \tFirst attempt"
