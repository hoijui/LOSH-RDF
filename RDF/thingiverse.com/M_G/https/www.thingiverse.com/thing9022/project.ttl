\r
It is parametric, so you can modify the width, length and thickness to make a cover for another knife with a similarly shaped profile\r
\r
Warning:\r
Knives will cut! Ceramic knives will cut you so quickly, deeply and cleanly you will not realise until there is blood all over the kitchen! Keep it sheathed and be careful!\r
\r
Note:\r
the dimensions were measured with a ruler from a simple pencil trace and may not be super accurate. The shape (triangular cross section with outline of the square root of a sinewave from 0-120 degrees rotated by 8 degrees) is also a guess but looks pretty close. I taped down the edges of the raft to prevent it from falling over during the print, you might need to do likewise""" ;
