    okh:function "A modification of 4ndy's Sandpaper holder to fit 5cm wide strips of sandpaper that are lying around in the lab here. The curved front is useful for sanding certain shapes that 4ndy's original flat fronted version might not have been suitable for. Also, rather than use a nut and bolt to tie the 2 halves together I have opted for printed clips that slide over the join between the 2 sides to wedge the sandpaper into place. To attach the clips to each other you can drill out the cone shaped drill guides to 2.8mm diameter on one side and 3mm diameter on the other and glue some offcuts of 3mm filament into the smaller holes to make a peg that will snugly fit into the slightly larger hole." ;
