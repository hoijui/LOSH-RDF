Perhaps some will find this useful if they donâ€™t have access to relays. A variant of the ToM Extruder Relay Fix for dying extruder motors that operates in the forward and reverse directions. This thing uses 4x NPN Transistors, 2x resistors and 4x 1N400X series diodes.\r\n\r\nI have not yet built this myself though!"
