function = "An attempt to generate a brilliant cut diamond shape based on info describing an ideal cut from http://www.folds.net/diamond_design/index.html\r\nFor something more easy to digest, have a look here https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Brilliant_%28diamond_cut%29#Facet_proportions_and_names\r\n\r\nWarning: This is just a simplified approximation of a brilliant cut, I am not a jeweller, but this should give you a good idea of size, shape and proportion. Most likely this shape will not print well without well calibrated support.\r\n\r\nMy code numbering scheme is as follows\r\n\tVersion_number < 1.0 not ready to be used by others\r\n\tVersion_number ==1.0 ready to be used provided you really know what you're doing\r\n\tVersion_number > 1.0 generally safe for use\r\n\r\nTo do:\r\n - \tadjust the ratios for the extra 24 facets on top\r\n - \tadd ability to scale or specify a variable e.g. use provides height or diameter or carat weight\r\n - \tClean up code!\r\n - \tMake printable\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n0.4\r\n - \tdiscovered relationship between circumscribed circle radii for 8 & 16 sided polygons needed for creating perfect facets along crown and pavillion is SinA+CosATanA where A=(360/16)/2=11.25\r\n - \tsecond attempt to add 16 extra facets to crown and pavillion, using above relationship, more successful than previous attempt\r\n - \tfirst attempt to add 8 extra facets to crown successful, using above relationship\r\n\r\n0.3\r\n - \tfirst attempt to add 16 extra facets to crown and pavillion, somewhat unsuccessful\r\n\r\n0.2\r\n - \tattempt to add 8 extra facets to crown and pavillion  \r\n\r\n0.1\r\n - \tFirst attempt with 8 (9) faceted crown and pavillion on either side of cylindrical girdle"
