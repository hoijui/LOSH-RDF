    okh:function """An attempt to generate a brilliant cut diamond shape based on info describing an ideal cut from http://www.folds.net/diamond_design/index.html\r
For something more easy to digest, have a look here https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Brilliant_%28diamond_cut%29#Facet_proportions_and_names\r
\r
Warning: This is just a simplified approximation of a brilliant cut, I am not a jeweller, but this should give you a good idea of size, shape and proportion. Most likely this shape will not print well without well calibrated support.\r
\r
My code numbering scheme is as follows\r
	Version_number < 1.0 not ready to be used by others\r
	Version_number ==1.0 ready to be used provided you really know what you're doing\r
	Version_number > 1.0 generally safe for use\r
\r
To do:\r
 - 	adjust the ratios for the extra 24 facets on top\r
 - 	add ability to scale or specify a variable e.g. use provides height or diameter or carat weight\r
 - 	Clean up code!\r
 - 	Make printable\r
\r
Changes:\r
0.4\r
 - 	discovered relationship between circumscribed circle radii for 8 & 16 sided polygons needed for creating perfect facets along crown and pavillion is SinA+CosATanA where A=(360/16)/2=11.25\r
 - 	second attempt to add 16 extra facets to crown and pavillion, using above relationship, more successful than previous attempt\r
 - 	first attempt to add 8 extra facets to crown successful, using above relationship\r
\r
0.3\r
 - 	first attempt to add 16 extra facets to crown and pavillion, somewhat unsuccessful\r
\r
0.2\r
 - 	attempt to add 8 extra facets to crown and pavillion  \r
\r
0.1\r
 - 	First attempt with 8 (9) faceted crown and pavillion on either side of cylindrical girdle""" ;
