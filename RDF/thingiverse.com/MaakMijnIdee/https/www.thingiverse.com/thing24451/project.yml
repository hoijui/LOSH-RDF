function: "It took quite some time but I finally finished my AT-ST Scout Walker from Star Wars tonight!\r\n\r\nIt was quite hard to not make a million parts but to keep it printable. I hope I succeeded in doing so but I didn't have time to print my own one (yet :-)) Base model credits to Sketchup user Guinlann.\r\n\r\nThanks for the designers of the Dreadnought and Yoda. They gave me the inspiration to draw this one.\r\n\r\nHope you like it!\r\n\r\nEDIT 23-3-2013: Sven Grundmann repaired the STL's! They appear to be printable now."
