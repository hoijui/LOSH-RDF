function = "A hinge that comes apart easily by lifting up.\r\n\r\nAfter browsing Thingiverse for quite a while to find a hinge that would easily detach from my bot and not finding anything I created a couple.\r\n\r\nI just added a few pics of the hinge in action!  Pay no attention to the crack in the plexiglass... \r\n\r\nIt works!  Now I just need to find or design a latch to keep it closed.\r\n\r\nHinge2.stl seems better suited if your acrylic is on top of the wood rather than flush with it.\r\n\r\nJust designed and printed a knob/latch for the doors:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19695"
