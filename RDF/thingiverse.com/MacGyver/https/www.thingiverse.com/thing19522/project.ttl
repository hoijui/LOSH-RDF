\r
After browsing Thingiverse for quite a while to find a hinge that would easily detach from my bot and not finding anything I created a couple.\r
\r
I just added a few pics of the hinge in action!  Pay no attention to the crack in the plexiglass... \r
\r
It works!  Now I just need to find or design a latch to keep it closed.\r
\r
Hinge2.stl seems better suited if your acrylic is on top of the wood rather than flush with it.\r
\r
Just designed and printed a knob/latch for the doors:\r
