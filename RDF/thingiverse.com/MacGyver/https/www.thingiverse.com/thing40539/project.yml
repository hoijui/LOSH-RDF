function: "Found this model and saw that some people were requesting a V8 Engine Block.  I found this one online and cut the bottom flat so it should print without support of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe front of this engine block is same as the rear.  I guess whoever modeled it didn't know the back of an engine block is different."
