function: "This is a case for the TP-Link TL-WR703N which is being used by many hacking projects around.\r\n\r\nThe router already comes with a compact case, but quite difficult to pry open.\r\n\r\nI modelled this case a few months ago to allow for easy hacking with a friction fit lid that can be popped off to get access to the serial ports and other components.  It was mainly an exercise in getting the measurements right for future custom cases [uploading those tomorrow].\r\n\r\nhttp://www.madox.net/"
