function: "This is a case for the TP-Link TL-WR703N router with an additional open source expansion board which adds on a USB Hub for a total of 3 USB ports available, a FTDI 2232 chip with 10GPIO broken out as well as the MPSSE pins for serial/JTAG/I2C/SPI etc.  i.e. this would make a great low cost/low power robotics controller.\r\n\r\nMeasurements derived from original case, with a change to a slide in arrangement to house the expansion board with the case acting as a board spacer as well.\r\n\r\nBlog post with firmware ROMs and HOWTOs will be made available on http://www.madox.net/blog/tp-link-tl-wr703n/ shortly.  \r\n\r\nThe OSHW expansion board details for the TL-WR703N is available here :- http://www.kean.com.au/oshw/WR703N/"
