function: "A cable clip that can be fastened to the wall. It was built to work with a 9.4mm diameter extension cable, but you can modify it for whatever. I would recommend attaching it with nails as if you are not careful screws will split the holder. \r\n\r\nI realize this size is specialized, but I really wanted to share something with the community so I included the original Sketchup file."
