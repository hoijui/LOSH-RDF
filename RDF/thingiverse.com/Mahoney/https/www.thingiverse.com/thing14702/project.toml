function = "Mr. Jaws is awesome. He is an evolution of Mr. Alligator, so do yourself a favor and print the pair! What could be cooler than having the king of the ocean guard your chips?  \nCheck out the song -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDNlSpKLEEo  \nEdit: Mr. Jaws v2 has been calibrated to exactly match the scaling of Mr. Alligator. This way when you print the two, Mr. Jaws does not seem so skinny. The original is skinner to permit faster printing."
