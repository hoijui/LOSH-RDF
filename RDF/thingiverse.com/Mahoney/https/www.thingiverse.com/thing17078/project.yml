function: "If your like me, sports don't play a huge roll in your life. Sure, I love participating in them and even sometimes watching, but I don't have a fantasy team, know little to nothing of a teams history or roster, and am generally unaware of most of the rules.\r\n\r\nThis can make for some social awkwardness at certain times of the year. Since everyone is dying to know who I'm rooting for, and I don't have any good reason to pick one over the other (though I do live in New York), I figured I would let chance decide. \r\n\r\n**My coin flip landed on NYG if you are wondering. This might have saved me more headache than I realized**"
