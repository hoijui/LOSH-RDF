function = "Atmel offers a very low cost in-circuit-emulator called the AVRDragon.  Unfortunately, it does not have an enclosure, so one needs to be careful not to short out the ICE with an errant bit of clipped wire or something.\r\n\r\nThis was my first project with a new Makerbot Replicator dual head.  \r\n\r\nThe lid has a hole in it so the status LEDs can be seen.  I intend to get some clear filament to see if I can make a light pipe from the LEDs to the surface of the lid.  But I would not define this as a work in progress.  The light pipe thing is more of a next learning step for me (dual extrusion)."
