function = "This is a simple fan guard so I won't harm my fingers while holding a small fan. \r\n\r\nWhy am I holding a small fan you ask?\r\n\r\n I've been working on something and needed to print overhangs with aggressively acute angles without using supports.  I noticed I can get angles down to about 15 degrees and still have a quality print if I blew on the hot ABS as it is printing.  So I ran down to Radio Shack and bought a small fan.  \r\n\r\nThe picture is of 5x5x10mm cube with a 1x1x10mm arm coming off at a 15 degree angle to horizontal.  The cube and arm on the left have no air flow. The cube and arm on the right do.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind this is a layer height of .27mm and a feed rate of 80mm/s. The slices at this layer height do not have much to grab onto.  It's kind of a torture test for the problem I'm trying to solve."
