function = "We have an old magnetic dart board that has half the darts missing, but the game is still fun, so why not make new darts?\r\n\r\nThis is no longer a work in progress.  These things came out great!  Nice feel in the hand.  Nice weight distribution.  Good flight characteristics... better than the originals!\r\n\r\nI'm biased, of course, but I recommend making these if you have a magnetic dart board.  Oh heck!  Go out an buy a magnetic dart board and replace the darts with these! :-)"
