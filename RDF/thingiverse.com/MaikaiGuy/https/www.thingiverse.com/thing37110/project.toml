function = "Inspired by \"Whirly One\", created by seedwire (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36217), I wanted to make another toy I had as a child.  I looked for some puddle jumpers on Thingiverse, but they were not the same.\r\n\r\nI got my first puddle jumper as a small child when visiting FAO Schwartz, when it was a warm and magical toy store on the Southeast corner of 5th and 58th, not the cold commercialized and corporatized version now situated across 58th street.   \r\n\r\nThe puddle jumper sparked my first serious interest in aerodynamics..  It is a very fond memory of mine, as you can probably tell."
