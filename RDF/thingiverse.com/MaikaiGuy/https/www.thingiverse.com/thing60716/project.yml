function: "Improved!  More robust filter basket and now with coffee scoop and filter holder!  ;-)  \n\nI like my coffee filtered through paper.  It just tastes better to me. The metal screen on the reusable Keurig filter left me wanting... and it was too clumsy to use with the EZ Cup filters I like.  \n\nI designed a reusable cup with an integrated basket for good filter drainage. There is also a stand which holds the cup securely while being filled with coffee.   \n\nI buy EZ Cup paper filters from e-bay.  They were cheap."
