function = "Based off of julienM's work.  Simply kludged space for an LM8UU bearing.  In the process I had to widen the rod slots as well to ensure no contact/friction along the model.\r\n\r\nNote: julienM also created an LM8UU version of this at the same time.  You should test that one as well.  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:41986\r\n\r\nThe bearing holes and the rod shafts are purposely a little large to allow for a tiny bit of displacement to match your specific rod width.  Use zip ties to ensure the bearings stay in place.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added an instruction for drilling the mounting plate holes, as per JulienM's suggestion."
