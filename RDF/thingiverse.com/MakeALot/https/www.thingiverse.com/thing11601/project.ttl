\r
This is really just a little project that I've been fiddling with over the last few months when I have a moment to spare. \r
Purely for my own enjoyment (yes, I know, I should get out more), but you are welcome to try if you wish.\r
I'm sure there are a whole raft of engineers ready to tell me that this is wrong in so many ways and I look forward to being enlightened by their candid observations and everyone's improvements & modifications.\r
\r
For anyone who'd like to try it, it really is a work-in-progress and although it works quite happily at 50mm/s feed rate, it is not yet what I would consider finished.\r
\r
This version requires an X carriage of its own because I've centred the X pulley. As it sits lower on the rods, it gives you > 126mm on the Z axis,  so you'll need to place your HBP very high to stop the Z stage falling off the lead screw.  (I'll make it ride higher in the next version which will give the stepper more clearance over the bed as well).\r
\r
I should have moved the Y limit switch but to save any hassle I added a long arm to the centre section that operates it in its current position.\r
\r
I also think the X limit switch should be moved to the side of the carriage to clear the pulley bolt.\r
\r
I ended up using 4 bearings although I started out with 3.  The inertia of the motor side is too great for the bearings on the right to stop the carriage twisting, I think I may try moving the motor to the right and go back to 3 in a later version.\r
\r
I also intend to move the bearings closer together and remove more material from the base of the carriage to make it lighter.\r
\r
\r
I'll post some photos of it installed when I get a chance.""" ;
