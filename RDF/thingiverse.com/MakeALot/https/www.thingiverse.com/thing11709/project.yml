function: "I have always liked Peeled Faces by M.C. Escher. But I couldn't think of a reasonable way to print a version before. Seeing that some can use (or at least plan to use) support material, I have included this first test.\r\n\r\nWe can print peeled oranges, sliced eggs, coiled springs, rotating mobile toys - all manner of useless but fascinating things.\r\n\r\nAs well as inspiration from Escher, I should also note the prior art of OhadReiter http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9224, thanks to both (and Bre for the subject matter!)."
