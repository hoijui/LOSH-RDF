Here are 15 basic printable (without support) shapes that can be produced in 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 100 sided versions.  

That's over 300 basic shapes before scaling, chopping, merging, etc.  

I've posted up the 100 sided versions as STLs and some examples of the others so that you can just print them if you don't feel like playing with OpenSCAD. If you can't find the one you want, let me know the shape and how many sides and I'll pop up an STL for you.  



I think that's enough for now - maybe I'll make some lids for them another time.""" ;
