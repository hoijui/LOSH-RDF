function: "You know how it is, your buddy has just gone downstairs to the parking lot and his phone rings.  He doesn't need to miss that call. Load his phone into the handy iFlown and throw it to him out of the window.\r\n\r\nAwe-chute (Awesome Chute) also included for when you realise it was your phone ringing. (usually accompanied by the cry of \"Awe Shoot\").\r\n\r\nThanks to Lars S\xC3\xB8rup for the phone model http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12879"
