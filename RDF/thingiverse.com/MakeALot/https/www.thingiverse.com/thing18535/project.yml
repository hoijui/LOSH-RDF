function: "A few things drove me to make this play set:\r\n\r\nI love the way these shapes fit together.\r\n\r\nI needed to get PLA printing correctly on my extended machine as I have increased the build surface without increasing the size of the heater PCB.\r\n\r\nI needed a test piece for calibration and testing.\r\n\r\nIn December, I received a sample set of coloured PLA from Faberdashery and I wanted to make something that showed off the range of colours without needing too much of any particular one.\r\n\r\nEach individual piece is difficult to print because of the 45 degree angles, the small corners which tend to curl up if not cooled sufficiently and the initial surface contact with the build platform.\r\n\r\nI already have a lot of 20mm cubes..."
