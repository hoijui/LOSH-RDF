function: "A Tardis with movable doors.\r\n\r\nYes, I know only one is supposed to move, but the intention is to have them opening outward and then put some of my stacking drawers in it.\r\n\r\nI printed this 50% scale to test it worked and it looked so nice that I thought I'd upload it for all.\r\n\r\nI did search for Tardis, but I found so many results that this may be a duplicate of someone else's effort, sorry, let me know and I'll include a link here.\r\n\r\nI also thought about making Tardis Matryoshka dolls, but each inner model would have to be bigger than its container - needs more thought..."
