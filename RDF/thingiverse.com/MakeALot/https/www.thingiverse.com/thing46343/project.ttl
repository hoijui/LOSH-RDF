\r
I then had to attach it with tape.  \r
\r
I thought I'd better model a new one before this fell off again and was no longer usable.\r
\r
I'm afraid my model may not be as accurate as I would like in the melted area as I never studied it prior to the hug with the head, so I don't know what it should look like.""" ;
