function: "Yesterday, my fan duct broke off during a print and spent some time in the company of the hot end before I could recover it.\r\n\r\nI then had to attach it with tape.  \r\n\r\nI thought I'd better model a new one before this fell off again and was no longer usable.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid my model may not be as accurate as I would like in the melted area as I never studied it prior to the hug with the head, so I don't know what it should look like."
