\r
I managed to find a supplier of Tartan ABS in China.\r
The supplier says that they are also able to manufacture spotted and striped versions, but only in 3mm. (apparently the spots are too big to fit on the 1.75 mm and the stripes slide off)\r
\r
I'm assured that the PLA versions will follow and an intriguing Sky-blue Pink that I can't wait to see.\r
\r
I'm already imagining all the things I can make:  Holes for rivets, Sky hooks, Long weights, Left handed screwdrivers, Sharp string, the list is endless...\r
\r
Update:\r
Shipping will start on the 31st of April.""" ;
