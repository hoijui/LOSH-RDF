function: "Printable spool equivalent in size to MakerBot Filament Spool.\r\n\r\nI only have one spool and the rest of my filament is a pain in the neck.\r\nUntil I have used this up, I need a filament spool or two that fit on Charles Pax's MakerBot Filament Spool Holder.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are plenty of good spools out on Thingiverse already, and I'm sure I should reference half of them as inspirational to this one. I couldn't find one that was a direct replacement for the MakerBot spool, which is what I wanted.\r\n\r\nI've posted it in-case someone else is pulling their hair out trying to manage with just one, like me...\r\n\r\nThe filament guide is just a quick hack, but it also works as an adjustable break and slides onto the top of the ToM. I should really have updated the spool holder to include the filament guide."
