Whilst the other pencil designs I have uploaded are attractive enough as art, they lack much practical application. This design spreads the pencils enough for you to insert and replace them easily, displays all of them so you can find the one you are looking for, stays reasonably balanced when you remove a few, accepts differing diameter pencils, hides the sharp ends, and looks reasonably OK if a little utilitarian.  I don't know how well it will function with a mixture of long and short pencils, I suspect that you'll need to place the shorter pencils in the closest holes.""" ;
