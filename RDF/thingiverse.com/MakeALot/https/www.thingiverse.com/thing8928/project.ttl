Somewhere to put down your charmed glasses http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8920  



Print them in glow-in-the-dark ABS to help your party goers find them!  



The holder will hold up to 6 coasters.  



Added one with a thin back for NYCDesigner and anyone else who wants to try a two colour print!  



The domed one is for Bluemetal to try as a speaker cover I wouldn't use this as a coaster unless you really want to confuse your drunk guests (and don't mind the mess :)""" ;
