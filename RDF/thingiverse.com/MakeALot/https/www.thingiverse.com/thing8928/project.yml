function: "Spiro-graph coasters (Cup/Glass/Beer/Wine Mats) and holder  \n\nSomewhere to put down your charmed glasses http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8920  \n\n\n\nPrint them in glow-in-the-dark ABS to help your party goers find them!  \n\n\n\nThe holder will hold up to 6 coasters.  \n\n\n\nAdded one with a thin back for NYCDesigner and anyone else who wants to try a two colour print!  \n\n\n\nThe domed one is for Bluemetal to try as a speaker cover I wouldn't use this as a coaster unless you really want to confuse your drunk guests (and don't mind the mess :)"
