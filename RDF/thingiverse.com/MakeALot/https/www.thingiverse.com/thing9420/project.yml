function: "Linear Bearing Carriage X Axis LMB6UU NOT LM8UU as I originally put here\r\nI found some LMB6UU (SW06UU in US) linear bearings for \xC2\xA34.50 each, so tried them as a direct replacement for the bushes on the Y Axis based on thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9114 by splod, they worked so well that I created an X Axis carriage for them and here it is if anyone would like to try it.\r\n\r\nPeople in the UK can get them from http://www.worldofcnc.com/products.asp?recnumber=167 or get them from eBay ALOT cheaper\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nI printed the ABP version and found a miscalculation in the end bolt holes; these are corrected in the _FIXED versions of the STL and SCAD files"
