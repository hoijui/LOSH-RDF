function: "10-5-17  added a version based on a Bike used by a German bike club\r\n5-15-16...It's been updated again.\r\nFront forks are curved.\r\nHandlebars are shortened\r\nTire rims have 45 degree champfer\r\nOne version has a flat back to print with now support if that side is down\r\nOriginal size and 125% scaled version of both models are loaded.\r\nAll new files are named 5-15...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI first did this in May 2012 in Sketchup. At that time, I did not know some things I know now, one of them is how to make really round circles.  \r\n\r\nAttached are several new versions and a new Sketchup version  \r\n\r\nAdvanced improved bike pendant has rounder hubs and wheels and a thicker seat.  \r\n\r\nBalloon tire bike pendent is the advance one with round balloon tires added. I know, wrong bike frame for them.  \r\n\r\nBalloon Tire bike pendent flat sided is the above but with tires trimmed so you can print it lying flat like the original.  \r\n\r\nI uploaded a 200 % version one with supports and one without.  \r\nI uploaded a 100% version of the Balloon tire with tree supports.  \r\n\r\nThese treelike supports work well and were generated in the latest version of Meshmixer  \r\n\r\nFor those of you who do big organized bike rides with friends I uploaded a couple of versions with interlocked bikes for your rest stops.   \r\n\r\nI also added a version I quickly did by eye in DesignSpark. I wanted to fool around with rounding edges.  I need to give it a print.  I think it could print flat without support."
