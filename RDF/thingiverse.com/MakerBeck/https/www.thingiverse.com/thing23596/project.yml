function: "I had destroyed a \"Gripper\" on my BD Workmate and decided to make a replacement.  I ended up with two versions, one almost identical to the original and a second one with some reinforcements.\r\n\r\n1-2-15 I loaded my repaired version as someone reported an issue.\r\nApr-4-17  Uploaded a double checked (repair) version with MM in the name.  All models are saved in MM.\r\n\r\n11-17-17 uploaded a redesigned version from Spaceclaim with smoother sides and some additional fillets.  Latest file is BD Workmate Benchdog 11-17-17\r\n\r\n2-5-18 while the old version from 2017 works fine, I decided to make it stronger by adding some 45 degree fillets to the internal right angles and under and behind the side wings."
