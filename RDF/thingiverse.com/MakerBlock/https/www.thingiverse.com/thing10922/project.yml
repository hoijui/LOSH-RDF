function: "Inspired by a Tweet ( http://twitter.com/#%21/mostley/status/103775960905691136 ) and a few images of a maple seed ( http://fieldlines.com/board/index.php?action=printpage;topic=137623.0 ) I have tried to design a printable version.  I've tried to make one that is somewhat organic while the other is more refined.\r\n\r\nI haven't printed this yet, but I will soon.  If you get the chance to crank these out, let me know how they fared."
