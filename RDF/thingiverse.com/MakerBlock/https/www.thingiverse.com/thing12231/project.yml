function: "A screw came loose on the metal baseplate of our dishwasher and I couldn't manage to get the screw to line up with where it seemed like it went.  So, I whipped up this little doohickey to hold the baseplate in place.\r\n\r\nIt's a quick OpenSCAD hack.  Not sexy, but it works.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I fired up OpenSCAD to printing was probably about 10 minutes total.  I printed slow and steady.  OpenSCAD firing up to fix was about 30 minutes total."
