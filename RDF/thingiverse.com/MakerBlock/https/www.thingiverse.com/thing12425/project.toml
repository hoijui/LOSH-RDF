function = "Yes, I realize I declared this challenge and am entering it myself. ( http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2011/10/11/openscad-challenge-klein-bottle/ ) I didn't start designing this until well after I had already posted it.  Since there are no real prizes, I figure you'll forgive me claiming the \"first to upload\", \"fewest number of facets\" and \"most resembles either Kelsorjâ€™s Klein Bottle ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5217 ) or RotoScanâ€™s Klein Bottle ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11976 )\"\r\n\r\nThe bottle could be rendered with even fewer facets by just reducing the number of faces on the cylinders in the OpenSCAD file.\r\n\r\nAlso, I hereby claim 9000 internet points!  Mu-ah-ha-ha!\r\n\r\nAlso, a shout-out to CloudSCAD is in order for letting me draft this up from my browser."
