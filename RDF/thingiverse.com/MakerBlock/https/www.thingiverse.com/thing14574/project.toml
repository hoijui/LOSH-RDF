function = "My wife has a thin flexible tape measure she keeps with her knitting stuff.  After watching her winding it up to put with her things, I suggested a small winder for it.  A few minutes with OpenSCAD and I had a design.  Luckily, the first print worked out great!  \r\n\r\nThe parts don't snap together, which would be a nice touch.  Also, for extra awesome points, it should really have some planetary gears so that a single rotation of the winder would be like 27 rotations of the inside core."
