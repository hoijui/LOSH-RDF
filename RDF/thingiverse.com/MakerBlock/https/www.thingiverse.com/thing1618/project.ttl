\r
You can find my X axis belt tensioner here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1673\r
\r
V1 - Based upon a single captive nut.\r
V2 - Fixing an alignment issue.\r
V3 - First printable version.  The smaller piece that holds the captive nut was too long.\r

V6 - Same concept, but a different design using two captive nuts on each side of the Y axis pulley.  My test print is suffering from some X stage problem, so the prints aren\\'t coming out right yet.  However, I wanted to post this in case I could get feedback from others.\r

V7 - Same concept with a few improvements.\r
