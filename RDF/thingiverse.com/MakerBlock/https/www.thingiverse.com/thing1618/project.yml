function: "Getting the Y axis belt tight enough can be a real pain. That's why I've designed this printable upgrade to allow increasing the tension on the Y axis belt / pulley by turning a screw.\r\n\r\nYou can find my X axis belt tensioner here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1673\r\n\r\nV1 - Based upon a single captive nut.\r\nV2 - Fixing an alignment issue.\r\nV3 - First printable version.  The smaller piece that holds the captive nut was too long.\r\n\r\n2010-01-23\r\nV6 - Same concept, but a different design using two captive nuts on each side of the Y axis pulley.  My test print is suffering from some X stage problem, so the prints aren\\'t coming out right yet.  However, I wanted to post this in case I could get feedback from others.\r\n2010-01-25\r\nV7 - Same concept with a few improvements.\r\n\r\nI created the screenshot from Unrepentantgeek\\\\\\'s Sketchup version of the Cupcake CNC.  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1449"
