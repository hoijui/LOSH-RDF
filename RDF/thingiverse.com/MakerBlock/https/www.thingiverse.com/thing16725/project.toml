Since I'm mounting these motors inside a box, the mounts are designed to go into the corners of the box.  \r\n\r\nThese mounts are also designed so that the motor shaft is pointed towards the wall.  This allows me to get the filament to spool and unspool as close to the wall as possible - hopefully keeping the pen up against the wall as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThe mount features a hole directly under the motor shaft for the monofilament line to go through.\r\n\r\nFinally, the mounts are designed to be reverseable.\r\n\r\nThe designs are mostly parametric."
