    okh:function """A printable upgrade to allow increasing the tension on the X axis belt / pulley by turning a screw.  Unlike the Y axis tensioner, ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1618 ) the X axis tensioner only requires a single piece.  The Sketchup file is included if you want to modify.\r
\r
Make sure your X pulley is assembled as shown to the left and is adjusted to the correct height so that the X belt is totally level all the way through ( http://wiki.makerbot.com/cupcake-xy-stage-installation#toc3 ). The tensioner may work if you have your pulley assembled differently, but you'll have to make sure the pulley doesn't rub against the tensioner.\r
\r
Special thanks to SSD ( http://www.thingiverse.com/ssd ) for testing and feedback.  Version 3 has a slight change suggested by SSD which may help some people.  \r
\r
If you're trying this for the first time, use Version 2.""" ;
