function: "A printable upgrade to allow increasing the tension on the X axis belt / pulley by turning a screw.  Unlike the Y axis tensioner, ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1618 ) the X axis tensioner only requires a single piece.  The Sketchup file is included if you want to modify.\r\n\r\nMake sure your X pulley is assembled as shown to the left and is adjusted to the correct height so that the X belt is totally level all the way through ( http://wiki.makerbot.com/cupcake-xy-stage-installation#toc3 ). The tensioner may work if you have your pulley assembled differently, but you'll have to make sure the pulley doesn't rub against the tensioner.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to SSD ( http://www.thingiverse.com/ssd ) for testing and feedback.  Version 3 has a slight change suggested by SSD which may help some people.  \r\n\r\nIf you're trying this for the first time, use Version 2."
