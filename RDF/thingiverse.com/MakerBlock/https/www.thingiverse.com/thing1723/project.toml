function = "I had a spring loaded retractable measuring tape which stopped working.  After trying to get it to work I figured I might as well take it apart.  After all, a spring loaded retractable measuring tape that doesn't retract is just a bulky measuring tape.  It turned out several small plastic components inside had broken and were now either so destroyed I couldn't measure/replicate them or were just plain missing.\r\n\r\nVersion 1: Uploaded 2010-02-02\r\nhttp://makerblock.com/2010/02/retractable-tape-measure-reloaded/\r\n\r\nVersion 0: Uploaded 2010-01-30\r\nhttp://makerblock.com/2010/01/new-print-retractable-measuring-tape/\r\n\r\nFor a larger picture and a little more detail, visit my blog at http://www.makerblock.com\r\n\r\nFirst I designed a small flat open ended cylinder which would hold the metal spring.  It had to have two notches - one notch to hold the end of the tape measure and another to hold the outer-most end of the metal spring.\r\n\r\nThen I designed a plastic holder for the small flat cylinder to fit into.  It has a small spindle/axle in the center with a notch for the interior end of the metal spring.  \r\n\r\nFAIR WARNING:  The interior spindle snapped right off when I tried to assemble this.  Thus, I had to improvise a little to put it together.  If you look closely, you\\\\\\'ll notice both the spindle and the interior edge of the larger part have a slight overhang to help keep the other parts in.  I built these features in hoping that it would just hold itself together.  In the end I just put two bolts through it to make it more permanent.  That\\\\\\'s why the picture you see has two M3x16 bolts/M3 nuts holding the interior part in place.  It doesn\\\\\\'t spin quite as freely as I\\\\\\'d like - but it does work.\r\n\r\nThis was really just a way for me to fritter away some time and over-engineer something that wouldn\\\\\\'t have even cost me $2 to replace entirely.  If I were to design this from scratch I would build it to use a skate bearing inside, captive nut, and short bolt.\r\n\r\nI\\'ve included the Sketchup files in case someone wants to take this further."
