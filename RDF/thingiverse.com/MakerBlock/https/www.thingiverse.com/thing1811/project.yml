function: "This is just a small tea cup sized to go with the Utah Teapot thing posted by phooky. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:821\r\nI have included the Sketchup file in case anyone wants to play with the design.  The walls are extremely thin, so make sure you have good Skeinforge settings.  FYI, the reason for the funky handle is to make it more printable. :)\r\n\r\nMore about this design and other things at my site http://MakerBlock.com\r\nTea cup post: http://makerblock.com/2010/02/tea-cups/"
