function = "You say you have a prinstruder but no printed dinos?\r\nFYI, given the size of the bottom layer these would probably come out better in PLA or in ABS with a heated platform.  Sketchup files included for you to play with.\r\n\r\nSo, whip up a Printruder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:958\r\nAnd then a few dinos!\r\n\r\nMore about this design and other things at my site http://MakerBlock.com\r\n\r\nUpdate 2010-03-10:  Don't print these.  I'm leaving them up in case someone wants to play with the designs.  I'd suggest printing up Zaggo's replacement dinos here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1912"
