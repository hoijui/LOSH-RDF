I tried this same image numerous times with very different settings.  Changing the image's size, contrast, and reducing the color levels drastically affect the tone and quality of the finished product.  \r

These two SVG's were the best of the bunch.  Some were a huge horrible jumbled mess and others were so sparse as to look like a pile of noodles.  \r
\r
Unfortunately, since both have so many lines in them, they are both very unsuitable to small line drawings.  However, I think they might be prefect for my DrawBot.  \r
