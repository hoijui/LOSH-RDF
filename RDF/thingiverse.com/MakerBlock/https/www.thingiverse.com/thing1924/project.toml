The downside is that I have neither tame nor wild mice to test this design on.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to cut out most of the lid from a peanut butter jar and insert this printed lid.  Hopefully it will allow the mouse inside to feast on the delicious delicious peanut butter but not let them out.  (Who would want to leave a room lined with peanut butter anyhow?)\r\n\r\nFor design notes about this thing, check out my blog at www.makerblock.com.\r\n\r\nFYI, I think I'm the first one to include a jar of peanut butter as a \"part\"!"
