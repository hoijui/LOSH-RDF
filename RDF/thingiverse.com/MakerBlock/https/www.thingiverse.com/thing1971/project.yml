function: "This is actually a derivative of my own printable ball joint - but I thought it would be funnier to make it a derivative of Erik's which is a derivative of my own. \r\n\r\nUsing Erik's suggestions I was able to remove the interior surfaces, flip some triangles, and make the STL file printable!  Thank you Erik!\r\n\r\nUpdate 2010-03-07:  I just printed it!  Unfortunately, there were too many strands holding the ball in place and the arms were too thin.  However, the ball part of the ball joint turned out beautifully."
