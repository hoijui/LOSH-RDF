function: "I didn't own a sugar packet holder, so I designed one and now I do!\r\nSince the base is fairly flat I had a bit of warping when I printed this without a heated build platform.  However, it still works great.\r\nI've included the Sketchup files in case you want to tinker with it.\r\nMore details at http://makerblock.com/2010/04/new-design-sweetener-holder/"
