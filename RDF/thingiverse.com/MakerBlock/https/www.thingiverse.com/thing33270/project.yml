function: "This is an articulated snap-fit assemblable Voltron action figure, made entirely in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nThe entire model, lion heads, and even Voltron's face are all 100% OpenSCAD. Fully assembled, the model is 160mm tall from feet to the top of its head and 90mm from shoulder to shoulder.\r\n\r\nI've used Tony Buser's pin connectors v2 and a new hinge/joint system ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33426 ) I designed to create hinges that will rotate through a user specified range of motion. The model can rotate the hands, shoulder, neck, hips, and at the waist. It can also bend at the ankle, knee, and elbow. Also, the wings can also be positioned.\r\n\r\nI had a lot of fun designing each of the appendages to match the personality of the Voltron-lions.  Besides the lion heads, my favorite feature of this model has got to be the slightly-parametric fake lion legs."
