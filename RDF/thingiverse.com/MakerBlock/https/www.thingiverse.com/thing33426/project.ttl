\r
I used a similar syntax to Tony Buser's Pin Connectors ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10541 ).  At the moment the file is only somewhat documented, but I'm uploading a project soon that highlights how these can be used.\r
\r
The parts I've printed with this system snap-fit tightly together with no additional work.  There is usually enough friction to the connections that hinges can be positioned or, with light sanding, swing freely.\r
\r
The included module, "joint_examples_with_descriptions_in_comments()" will create a set of example objects for you to try out.""" ;
