    okh:function """My Droid RAZR Maxx has a speaker on the back where the audio for video playback and music comes through.  This is fine when I've placed the phone screen-down, but it would be nice to have an elegant way to prop it up so I can watch a movie, show, or just have the screen face me while it's sitting out.\r
\r
Basically, this is a little squished sphere with a Droid cutout and a circular tunnel cutout so that the audio can (hopefully) travel from the back of the phone to the listener in front.  It would also really help as a stand for speaker-phone mode.\r
\r
I'll try printing it tomorrow and let you know how it goes.  :)\r
\r
The OpenSCAD file is poorly documented and not very parametric.  Nevertheless, I've included it if you're a glutton for such punishment.  :)\r
\r
Update - I made some minor changes to the model, including allowing clearance for a USB cable and reducing the overall size of the stand.""" ;
