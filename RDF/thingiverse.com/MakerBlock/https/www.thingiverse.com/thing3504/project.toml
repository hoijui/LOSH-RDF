function = "Some days planning to conquer the universe takes a lot out of you.  \r\n\r\nOn those days I just wish I had an army of genetically altered peoples from Skaro, entirely devoid emotions except for ambition and hatred, enclosed in a metallic casing providing them with all the weaponry, communications, necessities for survival and universal domination.\r\n\r\nIf you're like me, this cookie cutter may be just what you're looking for.  Each STL contains plans for two cookie cutters.  If people want a single-Dalek cookie cutter, let me know and I'll upload an STL for that.\r\n\r\nMore on this design at http://makerblock.com/2010/07/new-design-dalek-cookie-cutter/ or more MakerBot/RepRap/3D printing and design frivolity at MakerBlock.com"
