\r
On those days I just wish I had an army of genetically altered peoples from Skaro, entirely devoid emotions except for ambition and hatred, enclosed in a metallic casing providing them with all the weaponry, communications, necessities for survival and universal domination.\r
\r
If you're like me, this cookie cutter may be just what you're looking for.  Each STL contains plans for two cookie cutters.  If people want a single-Dalek cookie cutter, let me know and I'll upload an STL for that.\r
