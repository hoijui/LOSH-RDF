function: "I wanted to print up just one little space ship from makerschmitt's sweet space ship armada.  Using OpenSCAD I sliced out just the one ship, saved it as an STL, and present it for you to play with too!\r\n\r\nSince OpenSCAD had a hard time opening the original STL file, I ran it through Netfabb's online service first.  I've uploaded that file too."
