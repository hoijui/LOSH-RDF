    okh:function """Thinigiverse user brandonh reminded me of this old cookie cutter design I uploaded more than two years ago.  It was originally designed in Google Sketchup - and it had a lot of problems.  I decided to see what I could do with my newfound OpenSCAD chops.\r
\r
I stripped the Sketchup file down to a 2D cross-section of the llama and then exported it to a DXF using a plugin.  Then it was a matter of importing that DXF into OpenSCAD and whipping up a little script to turn it into a decent cookie cutter.\r
\r
The script can take a DXF file and turn it into one of two different kinds of cookie cutters.  One is a blocky cookie cutter where the cutting part of the cookie cutter is shaped like the outside edge of the entire cookie cutter (look at the STL render to get a better idea of this).  The slim cookie cutter has the cutting part closely following the shape of the object to be cut out.  \r
\r
The second type is more pleasing and probably more useful, but takes longer to render in OpenSCAD.\r
\r
AnyHOW... the result is an OpenSCAD script that can help you quickly create nifty cookie cutters from an existing DXF.""" ;
