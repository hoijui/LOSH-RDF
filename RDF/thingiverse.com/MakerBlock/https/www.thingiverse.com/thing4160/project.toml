function = "This is a VERY beta design.  I was inspired by a video on YouTube of a guy making a battery out of an aluminum can, copper wire, and salt water.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA6Jde77UNc  As a kid I had made similar batteries using zinc, copper, and salt water.\r\n\r\nFor this you will need:\r\n1. Copper wire\r\n2. A small sheet of zinc - although you could modify the design and make it work with a galvanized nail (aka zinc coated nail)\r\n3. Bits of wire\r\n4. Salt water\r\n5. Some acetone or ABS glue if you want to seal it\r\n6. A MakerBot that can print water tight objects\r\n\r\nMy 'bot is out of commission for a few days, so I won't get a chance to try this out for a little while.  If you do try, please let me know how the design works for you."
