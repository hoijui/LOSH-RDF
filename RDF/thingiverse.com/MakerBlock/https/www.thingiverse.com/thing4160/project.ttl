    okh:function """This is a VERY beta design.  I was inspired by a video on YouTube of a guy making a battery out of an aluminum can, copper wire, and salt water.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA6Jde77UNc  As a kid I had made similar batteries using zinc, copper, and salt water.\r
\r
For this you will need:\r
1. Copper wire\r
2. A small sheet of zinc - although you could modify the design and make it work with a galvanized nail (aka zinc coated nail)\r
3. Bits of wire\r
4. Salt water\r
5. Some acetone or ABS glue if you want to seal it\r
6. A MakerBot that can print water tight objects\r
\r
My 'bot is out of commission for a few days, so I won't get a chance to try this out for a little while.  If you do try, please let me know how the design works for you.""" ;
