    okh:function """I've got a PolargraphSD setup from Sandy Noble ( http://www.polargraph.co.uk/whats-a-polargraph/ ) but I didn't have a nifty case for it.  I couldn't fit my boards into the case Sandy designed ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32377 ) so I tried to make my own.  \r
\r
Sandy's case is really great - especially since it is able to completely enclose all the boards and the LCD screen.  The one I designed uses less plastic, but doesn't enclose the LCD screen.\r
\r
The OpenSCAD file is reasonably documented and can be used to create a case of user-defined thickness.  I've uploaded the STL's for a 1.5mm case and a 2.0mm case.\r
\r
I'm working on creating a snap-on cover that will go over the LCD screen, but this is pretty good for now.\r
\r

Edit:  In designing this version I printed Sandy's case and an earlier version of my own.  If you are interested in purchasing either, please drop me a line through my Thingiverse profile or through my website ( http://makerblock.com/contact/ ).  The earlier version of this case is 2mm thick and doesn't have built in mounting holes or vents.""" ;
