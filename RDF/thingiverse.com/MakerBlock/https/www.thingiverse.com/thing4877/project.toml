function = "I wanted to make a collapsable sword.  Ideally out of PLA so I could install a light in the handle.  I printed off a few proofs of concept, but none of them really seemed to work.  I've uploaded basically every main version I've worked on in the hopes someone will build a version that actually works.  This was the reason I tried printing a 10cm tall cylinder.
