function: "I wanted to make a collapsable sword.  Ideally out of PLA so I could install a light in the handle.  I printed off a few proofs of concept, but none of them really seemed to work.  I've uploaded basically every main version I've worked on in the hopes someone will build a version that actually works.  This was the reason I tried printing a 10cm tall cylinder. ( http://makerblock.com/2010/11/time-what-time-do-you-think-we-have/ )\r\n\r\nYou'll need to modify any of these versions to get something that might have a chance at working."
