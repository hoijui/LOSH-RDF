This thing is intended as a derivative of several other recent Things:\r\nFiring Mechanism\r\n*Disc Shooter by d_goodman http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4889\r\n*5C Coin Dispenser by Madoxnet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9huCbpgzkA\r\nDiscs\r\n*Base Cover of Centrifugal Pump by Madox http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4839\r\nAmmo Clip\r\n*One Leg Articulated Frog by Benjamin http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4771\r\nGun Case\r\n*Pencil Gun by Sublime http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4674\r\n\r\nI've broken the major components of the toy into design groups as such:\r\n*Gun Case files - for the moment this is a straight copy of Sublime's pencil gun.  \r\n*Firing Pin files - these are the only parts I have printed out.\r\n*Disc files - a variety of discs.\r\n*Clip files - a draft clip design"
