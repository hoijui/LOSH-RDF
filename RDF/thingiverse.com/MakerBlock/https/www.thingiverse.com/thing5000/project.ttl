 \r
This Thing consists of an image of its own QR Code, a Sketchup file containing the designs for its own QR Code, and an STL file which, when printed, will result in its own QR code being printed.  \r
\r
All files uploaded have the same file name, but different extensions.\r
\r
It is one of the few (only?) Things on Thingiverse which is functionally equivalent whether you print out the image using a 2D printer or the physical object described by the STL using a 3D printer.\r
\r
EXACTLY 5000 characters total were used in the names of all files, the name, description, and Instructions. (The previous sentence was a blatant lie).""" ;
