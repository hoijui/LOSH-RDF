function: "A derivative of several other Things, this is the latest version of my Open Source Disc Shooter.  I haven't designed an interlocking case yet, but assuming this revision works I will.  The OSDS has a funny looking handle, but that was so that it would fit on the build platform.  It could easily be extended by clamping a handle around it.  \r\n\r\nUpdate:  Replaced problem STL's with fixed versions."
