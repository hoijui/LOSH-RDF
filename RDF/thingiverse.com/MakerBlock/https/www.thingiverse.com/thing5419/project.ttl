\r
The second screwdriver in the photo is just a sonic screwdriver pen light.\r
\r
In assembling my own, the end cap appears a little too small and the slider a little too large.  I'm sure everything was designed in proportion, but for an optimal print I would probably print the endcap 10% larger and the slider at least 15% smaller (I tried 10% smaller).""" ;
