function: "I like to use Sketchup, so I converted hobinjk's version into Sketchup files.  I think there's probably a decent way to make the end spring loaded, so I'm tinkering with some ideas there.  An LED, some batteries, and it has it's own light.\r\n\r\nThe second screwdriver in the photo is just a sonic screwdriver pen light.\r\n\r\nIn assembling my own, the end cap appears a little too small and the slider a little too large.  I'm sure everything was designed in proportion, but for an optimal print I would probably print the endcap 10% larger and the slider at least 15% smaller (I tried 10% smaller)."
