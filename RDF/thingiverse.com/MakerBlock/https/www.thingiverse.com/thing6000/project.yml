function: "I'm trying to upload a Thing-a-day this February.\r\nhttp://makerblock.com/2011/02/makerblock-thing-a-day/\r\n\r\nThe mirror was already bolted at the top to the wall.  Unfortunately, the bottom of the frame could be pried away from the wall by tiny fingers.  The solution was to create a bracket that would hold the bottom of the frame against the wall.  This isn't something that's going to be useful to many people... But, then again it's in OpenSCAD and easy to edit!\r\n\r\nDay 2: A mirror bracket.\r\nDay 1: A bathroom hook. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5999"
