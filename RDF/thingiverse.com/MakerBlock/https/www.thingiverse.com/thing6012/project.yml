function: "I was trying to upload a Thing-a-day this February.\r\nmakerblock.com/2011/02/makerblock-thing-a-day/ Although I have tons of things I've designed, printed, and created since the beginning of the month, I'm just now getting around to actually sharing them.\r\n\r\nThis is an analog notebook made from a paper bag.  The end result is a super sturdy and tough notebook made of 1/4 A4 sized sheets."
