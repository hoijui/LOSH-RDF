function: "The attached GCode will create a QRCode that can be printed with a MakerBot Unicorn, sized to print on a sticky note.\r\n\r\nI urge you, I implore you, I beg of you... whatever you do, do NOT print this.\r\n\r\nIn fact, turn back now.  Delete your browser history, close your browser, and try as hard as you can not to think about this.\r\n\r\nIf by some twist of fate you find that someone has printed this QRCode, for heaven's sake and all that you hold to be good and true in this life, do not under any circumstances scan this code.\r\n\r\nImage courtesy of \"me and the sysop\" http://www.flickr.com/photos/82386510@N00/3602259318/"
