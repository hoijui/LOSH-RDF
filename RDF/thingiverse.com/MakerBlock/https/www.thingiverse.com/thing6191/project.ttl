I've put the opto-endstops back into my Cupcake!  I had taken the endstops out because they weren't necessary for normal safe operation and tended to get a little cumbersome.  However, in the hopes of creating some auto-homing GCode, I've re-installed them.  At best I had a very jury rigged endstop trigger.  This is intended as a workable fixture.\r
