function: "I'm trying to upload a Thing-a-day this February.\r\nmakerblock.com/2011/02/makerblock-thing-a-day/\r\n\r\nI've put the opto-endstops back into my Cupcake!  I had taken the endstops out because they weren't necessary for normal safe operation and tended to get a little cumbersome.  However, in the hopes of creating some auto-homing GCode, I've re-installed them.  At best I had a very jury rigged endstop trigger.  This is intended as a workable fixture.\r\n\r\nDay 6: Cupcake CNC Optoendstop Trigger for X Minimum http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6191\r\nDay 5: Things That Cannot Be Unseen. thingiverse.com/thing:6097\r\nDay 4: Extruder to Stepper mounting plate. thingiverse.com/thing:6106\r\nDay 3: A shelving unit bracket. thingiverse.com/thing:6001\r\nDay 2: A mirror bracket. thingiverse.com/thing:6000\r\nBONUS THING: A Helen Weight. thingiverse.com/thing:6024\r\nDay 1: A bathroom hook. thingiverse.com/thing:5999"
