function: "I wanted a good way to hold a sticky-note pad inside my Cupcake.  This seemed like a good idea.  It's sized for Post-It brand sticky notes, but I've included my OpenSCAD file if you want to fiddle with it.  There are three holes for the bolt heads and five spots for inserting magnets.\r\n\r\nMake sure you're printing on a heated surface (even if you're using PLA) and that your platform is level and centered properly.  It's about 80mm square, so you don't want to start printing off the edge of your platform."
