function: "This autohoming GCode is designed for use with my Sticky-Note Tray for Unicorn Printing ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6631 ) and is optimized for my particular setup. \r\n\r\nIf you use this GCode you'll probably want to fine tune the XY variables for your particular machine.  There are three different GCodes depending upon how you want the machine to treat the tray.  They are:\r\n1. cupcakeunicornhometocenter.gcode - This will autohome the XY platform then bring it to the center of the Sticky Note Tray.\r\n2. cupcakeunicornhometobottomleftcorner.gcode - This will autohome the XY platform and then bring it to the bottom left corner of the Sticky Note Tray.  Some existing Unicorn GCodes (Tesla, Mona Lisa, etc) start assuming this corner as the start point.\r\n3. cupcakeunicornhometofront.gcode - This will autohome the XY platform and then bring it the X center and front of the machine.  You might want to take this little piece of code and add it *after* the drawing GCode so that it will bring the tray forward for removal of the sticky note.\r\n\r\nSchmarty's super excellent Inkscape to GCode plugin will start your print assuming it is at the dead center of your printbed."
