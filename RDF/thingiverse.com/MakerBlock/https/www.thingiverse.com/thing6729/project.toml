function = "How do you fit 100 acres of woods onto a sticky note for Unicorn printing?\r\n\r\nLIKE THIS!\r\n\r\nBe careful which of the two GCodes you use.  The one with \"autohome\" in the filename includes autohoming code.  If you don't have XY minimum endstops, it will cause problems.\r\n\r\nIn case anyone asks about copyright - the ORIGINAL Winnie The Pooh text and illustrations have been in the public domain for a few years now.\r\n\r\nFYI, this is TOTALLY printable and looks awesome."
