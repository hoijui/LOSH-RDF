function = "This Thing is an Inkscape template for printing on a bandaid.  The bandaid I used just barely fit onto my Sticky Note Tray, but I needed to keep it clipped down with binder clips.  The dimensions of the bandaid were a 19mm x 65mm wide area with two small curved areas at the edge, making the entire bandaid 79mm long.\r\n\r\nCustom bandaids for all!\r\n\r\nAs with the 100 acre wood sticky note GCode ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6729 ), this is based on the now public domain original Winnie The Pooh drawings."
