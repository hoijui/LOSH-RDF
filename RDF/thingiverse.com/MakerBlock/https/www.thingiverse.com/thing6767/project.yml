function: "I needed a way to mount the small MK6 fan on my MK6 extruder, so I printed one.\r\n\r\nThere are some overhangs, bridges, and whatnot, but it prints. :)\r\n\r\nThe box seems to sit well on my MK6 without the need for any way of holding it in place, so I never designed one.  Hopefully you'll have the same luck."
