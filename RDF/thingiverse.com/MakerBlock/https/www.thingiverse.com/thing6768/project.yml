function: "My daughter owns a fairy themed tinker toy set - with enough pieces to build two little fairies.  Unfortunately, those fairies each use up one of only two very unique pieces that would come in handy for building other things.\r\n\r\nSo, I designed a replacement that takes the place of about two pieces that go into the fairy.  Since I was on a roll, I designed several other replacement parts."
