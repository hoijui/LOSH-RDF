function: "FYI, this is still a very alpha design.  I've printed the parts and am still changing the design a lot.  The fully assembled STL is only for an idea of how it all goes together.  The OpenSCAD file comes with a way to generate two plates of parts.  Those two plates of parts (already exported as STL's for you) include some spare parts.\r\n\r\nFor more info, check out the blog post(s) on this project:\r\nhttp://blog.makerbot.com/2011/03/06/project-robospider-introduction/\r\n\r\nYour help and comments are appreciated!!"
