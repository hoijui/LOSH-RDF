function: "Redesigned from scratch after lessons learned from printing the first version.  This makes use of the Involute Spur Gear Script from Greg Frost ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3575 ) and the Spur Gear Fitter Script by cbiffle ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6894 ) rather than my own terrible terrible gears.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Dna for designing his Rubber Band Ratchet Engine ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6939 ) to power this mechanism and for creating a video rendering of the mechanism in action:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDTNTEjXaco\r\n\r\nI've included an STL of the entire thing assembled, that's just so you can see how it's put together.\r\n\r\nAn ideal assembly would make use of two full clockwork spider mechanisms with a rubber band engine in the middle to turn both center gears.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend printing this using a MK6 or other stepper extruder.  If you use a DC based extruder the clean up will be a pain."
