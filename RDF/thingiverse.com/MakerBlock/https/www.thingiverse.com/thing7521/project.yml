function: "My daughter asked me to teach her how to navigate by the stars.  My friend the Wayback machine showed me how, courtesy of Quietbay.net.\r\n\r\nhttp://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071206161519/http://www.quietbay.net/Science/astronomy/nightsky/\r\n\r\nThe little tutorial through that link will basically teach you how to navigate by the stars in about 5-10 minutes.  I took one of the images from the tutorial, traced the important parts in Inkscape, deleted the image, labeled it, and scaled it down to fit on a sticky note.\r\n\r\nSince the Inkscape->Gcode extension I used does not fill in paths, the large black swath you see is really just an outline - so it doesn't obscure anything."
