function: "The Pandorica is not a fairytale.\r\n\"There was a goblin or a trickster or a warrior \xE2\u20AC\u201C a nameless, terrible thing soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos and nothing could stop it or hold it or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world.\"\r\nAnd that monster lives inside the Pandorica.\r\n( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Eleventh_Doctor#The_Pandorica_Opens_.5B5.12.5D )\r\n\r\nUpdate:  I've added the pandorica13.dxf file.  :)"
