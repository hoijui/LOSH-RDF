function: "I bought fan to add to my extruder barrel cooling duct ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8461 ) and wanted to run it from the same wires that I was previously running to the fan on top of the stepper extruder motor.  Since I didn't want to cut the female connectors off of the two fan leads, I decided to design a connector that both pieces could fit into.\r\n\r\nThe STL creates four of these connectors, you'll only need one."
