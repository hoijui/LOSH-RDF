function: "This is a derivative of my own prior extruder barrel cooling duct.  ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8461 )\r\n\r\nIt is optimized for a 40mm fan, which won't fit inside the 35mm gap between the two large sides of a standard MK5-6 extruder.  I find that PLA prints much better with active cooling directly on the barrel itself.\r\n\r\nThe section STL is for a replacement side to the extruder.  It is functionally identical to the original small acrylic piece that fits there - except that it has a big rectangular hole to allow additional ventilation.\r\n\r\nI've of course included the OpenSCAD design files, but I didn't try to make the fan mount terribly parametric.  There are some variables you could set, like thickness to all parts, but it's not fully parametric.  If you have a different fan from mine (40x40x26mm) then you're going to want to redesign the fan mount anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the DXF of the front acrylic panel was so that I could essentially create a virtual extruder holder for making sure everything aligned.  If you uncomment the section at the top, you can see it too.  ;)"
