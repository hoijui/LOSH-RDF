function = "I have a new project I'm working on, but I needed to have an idea of the angles involved.  I couldn't find a protractor, so I made one.  :)\r\n\r\nThe protractor has two sets of angle-finders, an inner and an outer ring.  The marks on each ring are 10 degrees apart.  The two rings are set 5 degrees from one another.  \r\n\r\nIf you require a greater degree of measurement, you could always edit the OpenSCAD file to include finer gradations.  For my purposes, this worked really well."
