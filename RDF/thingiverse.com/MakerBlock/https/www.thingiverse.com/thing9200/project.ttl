\r
The protractor has two sets of angle-finders, an inner and an outer ring.  The marks on each ring are 10 degrees apart.  The two rings are set 5 degrees from one another.  \r
\r
If you require a greater degree of measurement, you could always edit the OpenSCAD file to include finer gradations.  For my purposes, this worked really well.""" ;
