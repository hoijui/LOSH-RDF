function: "The 27 Spidersaur STL parts organized into just 5 printing plates.  You'll need to print plates 2 and 3 twice each, all other plates once.  The plates are all sized for printing within a 90x90 build area.  The parts are totally centered, so you can feel free to scale it up or down as big or little as you need.\r\n\r\nSince a lot of people were saying their copies were very loose and needed glue, I've made the STL plates 18% thicker than the originals.  (You can see this in the SCAD file.)  My parts slide/snap together VERY well and tightly, with no wiggle.  Some of the parts are pretty close to one another, a MK6 stepper extruder or similar is probably necessary.\r\n\r\nThanks to Renosis and Syvwlch for their help organizing plate 5!\r\n\r\nYou can download all of the STL's or the ZIP of the printing plates.  Have fun!"
