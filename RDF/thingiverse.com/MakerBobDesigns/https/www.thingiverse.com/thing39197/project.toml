function = "This is a different version of the spool holder made by chrispainter.  I made this in two pieces for better strength.  I also changed the hook and shaft orientation to make it easier to hang it in the existing spool holes on the Replicator.  The angled stops at the base hold the spool away from the printer, and the one at the end keeps it from falling off."
