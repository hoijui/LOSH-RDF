function: "I love the gimbal mount made by BrandonW6 so much that I am giving screwless cube gear and mount sets as gifts.  I needed a way to print more than one set at a time, so I made some plates for the bases.  I made a plate for the rings too, but you still could only print one set at a time.\r\nI made some grooves in the top and bottom of the rings so they will print as circles with no fill-in.  I made some (plates or towers?) with 2-6 ring sets with spacers in between."
