function: I have downloaded a few iPhone cases and all of them have fit issues, or are hard for the slicers to get to print properly.  I made this case to fit an iPhone 4s super snugly and it is pretty thin and easy to print with no support.  I am using this as a bed for some additional hardware (gears so far).  This is just a nice blank place to start.  Enjoy!
