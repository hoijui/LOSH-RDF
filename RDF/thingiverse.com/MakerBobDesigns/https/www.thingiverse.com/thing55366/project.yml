function: "This is a very similar design to my iPhone 4s Slim Case Blank.  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:51533\r\nI chopped, stretched, and massaged it until it fits like a glove!  Use this as a clean slate for your custom things.  Post pictures if you make one, and please let me know if you have any problems.\r\nI have also included a version with holes that expose the Apple and iPhone logos on the back of the phone."
