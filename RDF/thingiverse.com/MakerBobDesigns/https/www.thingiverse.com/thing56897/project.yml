function: I decided to start to sell some of my prints to help pay for the Maker Bot.  One of my new customers ordered 18 Screwless Cube Gears with Gyroscopic Gimbal Bases.  They have custom lettering that protrudes from the large faces, along with logos.  They gave them away as yearly performance awards!  I made sure to let them know about the designs from Emmett and BrandonW6, and pointed them here to Thingiverse.  Now I am on my way to having a FREE hobby!  Thank you both for the wonderful designs!  (I made both of your things ancestors to this thing, because without your help, I wouldn't need a logo)  They asked for an invoice, so I made one up with Maker Bob Designs at the top.  This thing is my 3D logo.
