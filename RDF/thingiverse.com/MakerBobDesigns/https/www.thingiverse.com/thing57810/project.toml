function = "UPDATE V3.0\r\nAdded clasp option.  Fixed hollow knurled option bug.  Bracelet layer thickness.  Optimized for customizer tabs (thanks tbuser!)\r\n\r\nUPDATE V2.0\r\nAdded Hollow and Knurled options.  Solved horizontal banding spacing issue to not break the 60Â° rule.  New ancestor: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9095\r\n\r\nUPDATE V1.2:\r\nBug fix for the solid option.  More code cleanup.\r\n\r\nUPDATE V1.1:\r\nNew option for solid bracelet.  Updated customizer input selections, and file housekeeping.\r\n\r\nI loved the stretchlet bracelet by emmett, but it was hard to tweak the settings to get a different type.  I have made heavy modifications to his original code, and added some new options.\r\nStarting out with the inside circumference to make sure it fits you.\r\nI fixed the bug where the number of corded bands affected the other types.\r\nI added vertical banding.\r\nI gave options for number of vertical and horizontal bands, CW or CCW cording, and many others.  Please try it out!\r\nP.S.  This is actually my very first foray into Open SCAD.  I was just fooling around with emmetts file and got carried away!\r\n\r\nFuture revisions may include: Hollow stl for easier printing, open loop with one bend larger to act as a clasp, and lettering on the flat bracelet.  Check back in later!"
