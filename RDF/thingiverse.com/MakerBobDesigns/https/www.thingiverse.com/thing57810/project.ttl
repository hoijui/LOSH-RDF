I loved the stretchlet bracelet by emmett, but it was hard to tweak the settings to get a different type.  I have made heavy modifications to his original code, and added some new options.\r
Starting out with the inside circumference to make sure it fits you.\r
I fixed the bug where the number of corded bands affected the other types.\r
I added vertical banding.\r
I gave options for number of vertical and horizontal bands, CW or CCW cording, and many others.  Please try it out!\r
P.S.  This is actually my very first foray into Open SCAD.  I was just fooling around with emmetts file and got carried away!\r
\r
Future revisions may include: Hollow stl for easier printing, open loop with one bend larger to act as a clasp, and lettering on the flat bracelet.  Check back in later!""" ;
