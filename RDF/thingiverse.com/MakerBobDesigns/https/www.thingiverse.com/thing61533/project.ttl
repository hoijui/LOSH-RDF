    okh:function """This is my second attempt at understanding the operations in OpenSCAD.\r
I made a model of a 4" square electrical box with a raised plaster ring in AutoCAD and then exported to an STL.  I couldn't get emmett's heart gears file to work, so I basically destroyed the original cubeGears3 code http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10483 until it didn't work either.  I rebuilt it enough to get the result I was looking for.  I made both the Gear1 and Gear2 module accept x and z rotation inputs (1 or 2), and then added some rotation code inside those modules, the twogears module, and the assembly module to make them behave for a non cube object.  I added an object module that loads a custom stl file and orients it for gear mashup.\r
\r
I am still not clear on the way the relationship between the overall model, the center and pins is determined.  I cheated and just tweaked the center cube until it looked like I wanted, and then I measured the necessary pin length and used the Pins library to make one.  I have not posted this revised code, because I don't really feel that it is any way an improvement over the original.  I may post it if requested, or if I can work some of the remaining bugs out.\r
The center stl has emmett's original slits, but I reoriented it in such a way to make them not work as originally intended.  It is OK, because it cleans up easily, and I made the center pins captured anyway.""" ;
