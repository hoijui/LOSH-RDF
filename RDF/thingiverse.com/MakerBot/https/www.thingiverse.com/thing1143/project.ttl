    okh:function """The Frostruder MK2 is a radically different approach to frosting extrusion.  Instead of using a motorized plunger approach such as with the Frostruder MK1 and Fab@Home paste extruders, we've switched to air power.  The result is a Frostruder with excellent characteristics:  nearly instantaneous start/stop capability, vastly simplified design, a high pressure capacity, and an awesome steampunk aesthetic.\r
\r
The way it works is pretty simple:  The frostruder is basically a syringe connected to a pressure source, typically an air compressor.  There are two solenoid valves to control the pressure:  a 'Pressure' and a 'Relief' valve.  When the Pressure valve is on, the syringe is connected to the main pressure source and that pressure forces out whatever paste material is in the syringe.  When you wish to stop the extrusion, the Pressure valve is closed, and the Relief valve is opened.  This part is critical because even after the Pressure valve is closed, the syringe is still pressurized.  By opening the relief valve, the pressure is released and the Frostruder stops extruding almost immediately.\r
\r
The frostruder is capable of extruding nearly anything with a paste-like consistency. There are many materials to possible, from food based items to awesome engineering resins. So far, we've had success extruding the following materials:\r
\r
* Frosting\r
* Peanut butter (creamy)\r
* Jelly / Jam\r
* Nutella\r
* Clay\r
* Silicone\r
* Epoxy""" ;
