function = "This is a prototype magnetic linear encoder board.  I messed up the footprint, so the board is not functional.  I'll fix this and get a v1.1 out ASAP.  Gory details here: http://blog.makerbot.com/2009/11/10/monday-rd-fail/\r\n\r\nThe board itself is going to be very awesome:  Sporting the Austria Microsystems AS5306 chip which is a magnetic linear encoder.  You put down a strip of adhesive backed magnet and then run this chip over it.  It will tell you your exact position over the strip down to 15 microns.  Hawt."
