    okh:function """Long Long ago in a land far away, there was a little castle surrounded by an industrious town.  The townspeople loved their little castle and wanted it to be perfect.  But the little castle was empty.  Its owner had left long ago, taking all the fine things with him and locking them away.\r
\r
The Townspeople resolved to re-furnish there castle.  They learned to craft and create.  Making chest and chairs, tables and beds, gadgets and gizmo's, they filled the castle with things that reflected themselves and their experiences.  They created so many things that at the end of each day it looked like little castle couldn't hold any more.  \r
\r
But the castle had a secret.  Every night, it grew.  Sprouting new towers, chambers, and cellars. The town's people would awaken and rejoice, ready for another day of crafting and creating.  The town was proud of its magical castle, and everyone wanted to fill it with the best that they could offer.\r
\r
But wasn't a magical castle, it was a MakerBot Castle.\r
\r
Each night the daring Damsels deftly deployed their wondrous Replicator, creating new rooms to extend the structure.  Floor by floor they built up into the sky.  Until one day the little castle had become the tallest and grandest in all the Thingiverse.  \r
\r
And the small town around the castle had grown into a great city, filled with the incredible things and spectacular ideas.  The Makers, Crafters, and Hackers had learned from furnishing the castle.  They had perfected their crafts and honed their skills.  When they looked out on the world from the tallest tower, and saw that it too was a place they could rebuild.  And they spread across the land, sharing their knowledge and teaching others how to improve the world around them.\r
