function: "Greetings Bold Adventurers!\r\n\r\nI know you must be pretty excited right now,  but please try to contain yourselves while we get thought this final pre-flight briefing....\r\n\r\nYour rocket is just coming out of the Replicator now.  And let me be the first to say, she\xE2\u20AC\u2122s a beauty.  This new model you\xE2\u20AC\u2122ll be flying has that stunning red-and-white color scheme, and a much lower risk of sudden occupant liquefaction.\r\n\r\nWe\xE2\u20AC\u2122ll be sending you on a daring voyage of exploration and discovery. You're going out into the furthest reaches of the known Thingiverse, with only your wits and those little helmets for protection. We have no idea whats out there... or if it's friendly. But here at MakerBot Space Exploration our engineers have decided its best to just say positive.\r\n\r\nRemember, it's the dream of every spool of filament to one day be printed into an astronaut, and you are the lucky few who get to live that dream.  Go forth my brave astronauts and see all there is to be seen!  Discover all that can be discovered!  Meet new prints and learn their ways!  Yours is the greatest adventure of our time!   \r\n\r\nAnd be sure to take lots of pictures,  you know we love a good slide show. \r\n\r\nCreated by Thingiverse user Skimbal, designer of the Turtle Shell Racers, MakerBot Botmobile and the Gothic Cathedral Playset."
