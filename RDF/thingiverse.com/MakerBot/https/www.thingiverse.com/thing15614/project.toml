function = "The daring MakerBot Damsels are in no manner of distress -- they deftly define their own world of wondrous wizardry.  Making, Creating, and Crafting, they dexterously develop designs for castles, creatures, and contraptions. \r\n\r\nDeploying Cupcakes, Thing-O-Matics, and Replicators, dozens of Damsels distribute production precisely for punctual perfection.  \r\n\r\nDastardly deed doers and nefarious ninja gnomes beware, the Damsels donâ€™t take kindly to klepto capers and would-be kidnappers.\r\n\r\nCreated by Thingiverse user Skimbal, designer of the Turtle Shell Racers, MakerBot Botmobile and the Gothic Cathedral Playset."
