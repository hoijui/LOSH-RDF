   \r
Not everyone gets to be exciting, and I elevate un-eventful to an art form.  Maintain an even keel, that's my motto.  \r
\r
You never know when an Adventurous Astronaut is going to come falling out of the sky.  Or if a Daring Damsel has Designs on accidentally bricking you into a castle.  In the face of these uncertainties I must remain calm, steady, predictable.   \r
   \r
Someone has to watch.  Being a face in the crowd is a noble duty.  I was there the day they launched the Rocket into the Thingiverse.  I witnessed the groundbreaking of the great castle.  I ran through the streets when the Aliens invaded, and cowered in terror when the Dragons stormed the keep.  \r
\r
Dull, Unexciting, Uneventful.  One of the multi-colored multitude.  That's me.  \r
\r
I was once fired from a catapult.  Another time, they left me floating on the sea.  I've ridden a mechanical spider.  Been tied to train tracks, and taken lessons in judo from a humanoid robot.  Base jumped from  the office balcony once, and hang glided on paper wings.   \r
   \r
Not everyone gets to be exciting, so I just try to maintain an even keel.  \r
