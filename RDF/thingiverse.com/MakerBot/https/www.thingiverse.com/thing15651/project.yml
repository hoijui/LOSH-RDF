function: "Hi, I'm Steve.  \r\n   \r\nNot everyone gets to be exciting, and I elevate un-eventful to an art form.  Maintain an even keel, that's my motto.  \r\n\r\nYou never know when an Adventurous Astronaut is going to come falling out of the sky.  Or if a Daring Damsel has Designs on accidentally bricking you into a castle.  In the face of these uncertainties I must remain calm, steady, predictable.   \r\n   \r\nSomeone has to watch.  Being a face in the crowd is a noble duty.  I was there the day they launched the Rocket into the Thingiverse.  I witnessed the groundbreaking of the great castle.  I ran through the streets when the Aliens invaded, and cowered in terror when the Dragons stormed the keep.  \r\n\r\nDull, Unexciting, Uneventful.  One of the multi-colored multitude.  That's me.  \r\n\r\nI was once fired from a catapult.  Another time, they left me floating on the sea.  I've ridden a mechanical spider.  Been tied to train tracks, and taken lessons in judo from a humanoid robot.  Base jumped from  the office balcony once, and hang glided on paper wings.   \r\n   \r\nNot everyone gets to be exciting, so I just try to maintain an even keel.  \r\n\r\n*Created by Michael Curry (Skimbal), designer of the Turtle Shell Racers, MakerBot Botmobile and the Gothic Cathedral Playset.*"
