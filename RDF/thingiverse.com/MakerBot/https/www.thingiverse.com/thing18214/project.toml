function = "Tick...  \n\nThe pendulum swings, releasing the escapement.  Stored energy is transmitted through the gears.  The hands move forward.  \n\nTick...  \n\nThe pendulum returns, the mechanism shifts.  The clock moves, a physical manifestation of the passage of time.  \n\nTick...  \n\nThe modern world is regulated by this simple sound.  A sound reaching back to the first mechanical clocks in the 13th century.  \n\nTick...  \n\nEach tick is uniquely human.  It expresses a yearning to bring order to the chaotic passage of events.  An attempt to break the unfathomable eons into moments small enough to be understood.   \n\nTick...  \n\n\nTick...  \n\n\nTick...  \n\n\nCreated by Thingiverse user Michael Curry (Skimbal), designer of the Turtle Shell Racers, MakerBot Botmobile and the Gothic Cathedral Playset."
