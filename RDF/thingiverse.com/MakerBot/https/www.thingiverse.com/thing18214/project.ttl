The pendulum swings, releasing the escapement.  Stored energy is transmitted through the gears.  The hands move forward.  

Tick...  

The pendulum returns, the mechanism shifts.  The clock moves, a physical manifestation of the passage of time.  

Tick...  

The modern world is regulated by this simple sound.  A sound reaching back to the first mechanical clocks in the 13th century.  

Tick...  

Each tick is uniquely human.  It expresses a yearning to bring order to the chaotic passage of events.  An attempt to break the unfathomable eons into moments small enough to be understood.   

Tick...  


Tick...
