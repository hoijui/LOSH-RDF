\r
Three obelisk are known as Cleopatra's Needle.  They were gifts from the rulers of Egypt to the cites of New York, London and Paris.\r
\r
But they were gifts with a catch.  The receiving city had to pay to move it. Each obelisk is a single piece of red granite weighing over 220 tones.  They were moved halfway around the world using ropes, horses, and steamships.\r
