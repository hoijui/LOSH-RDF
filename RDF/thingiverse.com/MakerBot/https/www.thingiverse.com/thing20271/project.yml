function: "Cleopatra's Needle. A unique monument to the age of Gunboat Diplomacy and the 18th century fascination with Ancient Egypt.  \r\n\r\nThree obelisk are known as Cleopatra's Needle.  They were gifts from the rulers of Egypt to the cites of New York, London and Paris.\r\n\r\nBut they were gifts with a catch.  The receiving city had to pay to move it. Each obelisk is a single piece of red granite weighing over 220 tones.  They were moved halfway around the world using ropes, horses, and steamships.\r\n\r\n Created by Ben Ellman with help from Michael Curry and Matt Griffin"
