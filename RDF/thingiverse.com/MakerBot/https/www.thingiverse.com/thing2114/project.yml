function: "These files were published on the Open Prosthetics Project website: http://www.openprosthetics.org/concepts/55/the-trautman-hook and all credit goes to the folks who created and put them there. They have been released into the public domain to keep the innovation cycle open. Very cool.\r\n\r\nWe've put them on Thingiverse to make it easy for folks to make derivatives, share pictures, and explore improvements."
