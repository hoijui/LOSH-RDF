function = "Bumper Bot Scyphozoa Domelia  \n Hello,my name is Jason Bakutis. I designed and built Bumper Bot to be a part of Makerbot's Robot Petting Zoo for the 2012 Maker Faire season.  \nSome of you may have already seen Bumper Bot in action. If so, then  you also saw how much the children (of all ages) enjoyed his company.  \n Bumper Bot is a friendly species of robot. He patiently finds his way around, whistling as he goes. If something blocks his path, he finds another way around. He can also be programmed to perform a variety of tasks.  \n  Oh yeah, he also has googly eyes, jets, and arcade buttons.  \n  I designed Bumper Bot to be built by others, with intuitive, easy to follow, steps. He is engineered in a way that encourages modification, so it is really easy to give your Bot personality.  \n  I look forward to the many awesome variations you all will come up with as you help populate the world with the next generation of Bumper Bots!  \n    Created by Jason Bakutis"
