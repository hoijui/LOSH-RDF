function: "Wheely, Pullus Sine Fuga Ex Machina.  \n  \n     Wheely is a domesticated subspecies of the common Flightless Aircraft.   \n\n     Found in the disused aerodromes of the southwestern deserts, Wheelies descend from earlier generations of autonomous UAV's.  They live in rigorously organized communities called squadrons and spend most of their lives socializing.  \n\n     Largely ambivalent to other mechanical organisms, Wheely retains his ancestors ability to detect electric fields.  \n\nCreated By Michael Curry (Skimbal)"
