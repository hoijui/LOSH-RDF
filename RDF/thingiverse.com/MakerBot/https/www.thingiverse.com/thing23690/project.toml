function = "Bubble Bot\r\n(bullae ex machina)\r\n\r\nBubble Botâ€™s name is actually a misnomer.  Bubble Bots are not robots, but sophisticated Dry Land Exploration Craft (DLEC) built and piloted by an unidentified race of aquatic organisms. The pilotâ€™s eyes can usually be seen glowing inside the botâ€™s domed cockpit.  Bubble Bot is covered in sophisticated sensors tuned to detect mechanical organisms in our unique, waterless atmosphere.  When startled the Bubble Botâ€™s pilot releases a stream of distracting bubbles to cover his escape.\r\n\r\nCreated by Todd Blatt (zenix) and Adam Fontenault (adamfont)"
