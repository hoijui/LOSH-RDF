function: "One of my favorite things about using a MakerBot is that you can watch things get created right in front of you.  This allows for awesome opportunities to add to the process while it's being made.  With this ring, I carefully (extruders and bed are hot!) place beads and gems inside of the ring which get encapsulated.  The beads rattle around and make for some noisy maraca style rings, and the gems look great through transparent PLA!  \n\n\n\nCreated by Todd"
