This fella is a scale model 1.40x10^23 to 1 scale model by mass.  \r\n\r\n1.26 GeV = energy\r\nc = speed of light\r\ne=mc^2 gives m = 126 GeV/c^2\r\n1 GeV/c^2 = 1.783Ãx83âx80x9410Ã¢Ëx86âx80x9927 kg\r\nmass of h0 particle = 2.24 x 10^-25 kg\r\nmass of h0 made on my MakerBot  = 31.5 grams\r\n\r\nratio of mass of MakerBot model to one detected in the Large Hadron Collider:\r\n31.5g/(2.24x10^-25 kg) = 1.40x10^23:1\r\n\r\nA couple of these are hidden around New York near our current office in Boerum Hill, and two are in the Baltimore area.  They are in geocaches, and need your help to make their way over to the geocache at the Large Hadron Collider!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.makerbot.com/blog/2012/08/03/makerbot-finds-higgs-boson-particle-too-and-so-can-you/\r\n\r\nCreated by Todd Blatt"
