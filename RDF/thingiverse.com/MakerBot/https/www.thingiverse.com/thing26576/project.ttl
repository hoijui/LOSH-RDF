    okh:function """Sure, we are a bit later than the scientists at CERN, but we found one too!  Make your very own replica of the Higgs-boson particle.  This fella is a scale model 1.40x10^23 to 1 scale model by mass.  \r
\r
1.26 GeV = energy\r
c = speed of light\r
e=mc^2 gives m = 126 GeV/c^2\r
1 GeV/c^2 = 1.783Ãâ10Ã¢Ëâ27 kg\r
mass of h0 particle = 2.24 x 10^-25 kg\r
mass of h0 made on my MakerBot  = 31.5 grams\r
\r
ratio of mass of MakerBot model to one detected in the Large Hadron Collider:\r
31.5g/(2.24x10^-25 kg) = 1.40x10^23:1\r
\r
A couple of these are hidden around New York near our current office in Boerum Hill, and two are in the Baltimore area.  They are in geocaches, and need your help to make their way over to the geocache at the Large Hadron Collider!\r
