function: "These teeth are made to be manually operated to chatter without the need for a windup component.  They were made with The Replicator and then bent with a  heat gun into position.  I gave these to a 'special visitor' who was being interviewed here this evening for a German TV show.\r\n\r\nCreated by Todd Blatt"
