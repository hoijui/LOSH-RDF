    okh:function """The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear distributed across much of northern Eurasia and North America. Adult bears generally weigh between 100 and 600 kg (220 and 1,300 lb) and its largest subspecies, the Kodiak bear, rivals the polar bear as the largest member of the bear family, and as the largest land-based predator.\r
  This sculpture was inspired by the famous diorama found here in NYC at The Museum of Natural History.\r
  Enjoy!\r
