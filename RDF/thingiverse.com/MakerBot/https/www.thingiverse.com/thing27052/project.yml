function: "This is an original design I came up with to (well, it's what I do) push the limits of what a Makerbot printer can do. I hoped the high level of detail in the stonework would show, and, as you'll see, it prints quite nicely. It's shown here in MakerBot's Slate Gray ABS.\r\n I want to see some cool dioramas cropping up here on Thingiverse!\r\n  Enjoy!\r\nCreated by Jason"
