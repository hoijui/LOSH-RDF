function: "I took the Olmec face, and sculpted the rest of the head using reference photos of many different Olmec examples.Then, I decided to add the figure to give both a sense of scale as well as a little narrative.\r\n   I've always been attracted to the Olmec head carvings ever since   I saw one as a small boy at the Peabody Museum at Yale University.\r\nThe model is shown here in MakerBot's Stone ABS.\r\n Created by Jason"
