function: "This game is awesome. Some call it Viking Chess, and it's pronounced 'KOOB'. Kubb is a bit like horseshoes or cornhole but with a bit more strategy and a few more things going on. \r\n\r\nMost people build a full size version and play it outside, but in rainy weather you're in luck! These smaller versions will be lots of fun to play with your Seej engines.http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24013\r\n\r\nCreated by Todd, MakerBot Kubb Reigning Champion 2012"
