function = "The Design Team over here at MakerBot have perfected the art of making links for this MakerBot Watch that print in place without needing to be assembled. Once removed from the build plate, they move freely, and can be taken apart and snapped back together. Feel free to download the design and adapt it for your own purpose.  \n\nMix and match your favorite colors to create an awesome watch for any occasion! Contrast the band with the pop-out bezel, or make links in multiple colors for an interesting two-tone band.  \n\nCreated by Matt Kroner, John Briscella, and John Dimatos"
