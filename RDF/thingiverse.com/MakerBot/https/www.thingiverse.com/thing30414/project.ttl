Once removed from the build plate, they move freely, and can be taken apart and snapped back together. Feel free to download the design and adapt it for your own purpose.  

Mix and match your favorite colors to create an awesome watch for any occasion! Contrast the band with the pop-out bezel, or make links in multiple colors for an interesting two-tone band.  

Created by Matt Kroner, John Briscella, and John Dimatos""" ;
