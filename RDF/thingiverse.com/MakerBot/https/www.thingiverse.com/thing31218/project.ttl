The shoe was printed in pieces, but if printed upright and assembled it does fit in the build volume of the MakerBot ReplicatorÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ¢2 Desktop 3D Printer.  I'd advise against wearing these though.  Though these are very sturdy, they were created just as a proof of concept and as display pieces.  



These look great with the matching MakerBelt!
