function: "Check out these awesome shoes! The straps are printed fully connected and clip into place into the side of the shoe.  The shoe was printed in pieces, but if printed upright and assembled it does fit in the build volume of the MakerBot Replicator\xC3\x83\xC2\xA2\xC3\xA2\xC2\x80\xC2\x9E\xC3\x82\xC2\xA22 Desktop 3D Printer.  I'd advise against wearing these though.  Though these are very sturdy, they were created just as a proof of concept and as display pieces.  \n\n\n\nThese look great with the matching MakerBelt!  \n\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31243  \n\n\n\nCreated by Todd"
