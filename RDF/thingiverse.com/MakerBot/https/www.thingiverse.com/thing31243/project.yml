function: "This fully assembled, print-in-place, functional belt is available now!  Print it out yourself and wear it to hold your pants up.  \n\nThe entire belt and buckle can be printed on one build plate on the original Replicator. The belt in the picture was made in Transparent Blue MakerBot PLA on the Replicator 2, and it works perfectly. You should be able to fit over 7' of belt at this scale on the plate at one time. Looks great with matching High Heeled Shoes!  \n\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31218  \nCreated by Todd Blatt"
