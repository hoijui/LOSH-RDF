    okh:function """We wanted to test the abilities of the MakerBot Replicator 2 to create amazing, high-resolution models out of MakerBot PLA. This tractor, based on the great design by Juan Esteban Paz (Thingiverse user jepaz), has 67 individual parts. Using MakerWare, you can arrange as many of these on the build plate as you can reasonably fit. The Replicator 2's massive build volume also lets us tackle more of these parts at once.\r
\r
Click on the pictures and check out how nice this model looks at 100-micron layer resolution. The individual files uploaded are just to show what a few of the parts look like.\r
\r
Be warned, this model may make you nostalgic for those simpler days out on the plains.""" ;
