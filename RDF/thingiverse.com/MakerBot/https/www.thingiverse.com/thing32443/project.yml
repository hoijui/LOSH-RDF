function: "When the MakerBot Store (298 Mulberry Street in Manhattan) first opened, we had to prop open the door.  The existing doorstop was the style that had a hook and a loop, but this was on the inside of the store, and we needed to prop the door open outward because of a temporary issue with the gate.  To solve this issue, we designed, printed, tested, and then revised the design to make a taller than average doorstop.  The first one was too short so a new one had to be made. This was a great use of a MakerBot Replicator\xC3\xA2\xE2\x80\x9E\xC2\xA22 Desktop 3D Printer!\r\n\r\nCreated by Todd."
