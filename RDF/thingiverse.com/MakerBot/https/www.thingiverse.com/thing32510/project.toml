This is a fun multi-media project seen in the December 2012 issue of WIRED. \r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\nBuy the necessary electronic components from RadioShack (grab a copy of WIRED to learn more!), download and make the parts listed below, and go find a standard bubble capsule from a coin-operated vending machine for the dome.   \r\n\r\nModeling by Todd; circuit design by Andres."
