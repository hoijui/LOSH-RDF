If you and your friends have a group costume thing going on, you can make as many of these as you need.\r\n\r\nLike the Cat Ears, Mercreature Fins, and Horns in the Halloween 2012 series, these fit on a standard headband.\r\n\r\nIf you want to grab a pair right away, stop by the MakerBot Store!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlien Antennae were created by Matt."
