function: "Cat Woman has got to be a popular costume this year, so here's our contribution to the season. If you really want to throw people off, put three of these on a headband.  \nLike the Mercreature Fins, Alien Antennae, and Horns in the Halloween 2012 series, these fit on a standard headband.  \nIf you want to grab a pair right away, stop by the MakerBot Store!  \nCat Ears were created by Matt."
