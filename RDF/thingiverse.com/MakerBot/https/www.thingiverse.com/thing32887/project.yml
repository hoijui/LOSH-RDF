function: "Make these in True White and you have bull horns. Make them in Fluorescent Red and you have a perfect set of devil horns for your costume.\r\n\r\nLike the Cat Ears, Alien Antennae, and and Mercreature Fins in the Halloween 2012 series, these fit on a standard headband.\r\n\r\nIf you want to grab a pair right away, stop by the MakerBot Store!\r\n\r\n\r\nHorns were created by Matt."
