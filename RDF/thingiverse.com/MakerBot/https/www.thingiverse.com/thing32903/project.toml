Scale this up and slice off the top for a great candy bowl, or use MakerBot's Glow In The Dark filament for a nice set of porch decorations.  \nFor a limited time, the whole set of zombies is available in the Gumball Machine at the MakerBot Store in New York City.  \nDesigner's Note:  \nI sculpted this in ZBrush 4 R4.  \n Android Zombie was created by Jason."
