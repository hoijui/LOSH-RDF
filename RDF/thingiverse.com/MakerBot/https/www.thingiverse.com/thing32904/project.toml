function = "Clive the Zombie, from the Halloween 2012 series. Scale this up and slice off the top for a great candy bowl, or use MakerBot's Glow In The Dark filament for a nice set of porch decorations.  \nFor a limited time, the whole set of zombies is available in the Gumball Machine at the MakerBot Store in New York City.  \nDesigner's Note:  \nI used a skull that I captured using 123D Catch as a base mesh, and \"zombified\" it using ZBrush 4 R4.  \n Brain Zombie was created by Jason."
