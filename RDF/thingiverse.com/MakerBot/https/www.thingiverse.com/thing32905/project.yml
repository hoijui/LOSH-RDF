function: "This cool two-piece set can be found along with other pieces from the Halloween 2012 series in the Vending Machine at the MakerBot Store. Or you can download and make your own right now!  \nThe coffin lid opens and closes, and the mummy can be removed so it can be free to exact vengeance against those who would dare to plunder its sacred tomb (or, if you just want to take the mummy out and play with it).  \nDesigner's Note:  \nThe coffin was modeled in Rhino, and the mummy was modeled in Zbrush, so this is a nice example of how hard-surface and soft-surface modeling can work together.  \nCoffin & Mummy were created by Christopher and Jason."
