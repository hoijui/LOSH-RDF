function: "The Witch's Castle, from the Halloween 2012 series. This is the very castle that can be found in the Gumball Machine at the MakerBot Store, but you can download and make your own today.   \nDesigner's Note:  \nModeled lovingly in Maya, and detailed in Zbrush 4 R4.  \n Witch's Castle was created by Jason."
