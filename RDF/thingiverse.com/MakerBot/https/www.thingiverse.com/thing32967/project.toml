If you're able to vote in the US, make a miniature of your favorite candidate and bring him into the voting booth with you. If you're a Thingiverse user outside the US, your download counts, too! \r\n\r\nThese Obama + Romney Busts are currently available in the MakerBot Store in New York City. \r\n\r\nDesigner's Note:\r\nTo design this portrait of Mitt Romney, I started with a base mesh built in Maya and worked off of several good reference images. There are actually many \"human\" base meshes out there for free download. I sculpted this mini-bust in Zbrush 4 R4. That program's new \"grid\" option is a useful way to build orthographic image planes. \r\n\r\n\r\n Mitt Romney was created by Jason."
