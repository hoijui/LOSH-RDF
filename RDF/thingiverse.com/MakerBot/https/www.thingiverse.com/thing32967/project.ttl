If you're able to vote in the US, make a miniature of your favorite candidate and bring him into the voting booth with you. If you're a Thingiverse user outside the US, your download counts, too! \r

These Obama + Romney Busts are currently available in the MakerBot Store in New York City. \r

Designer's Note:\r
To design this portrait of Mitt Romney, I started with a base mesh built in Maya and worked off of several good reference images. There are actually many "human" base meshes out there for free download. I sculpted this mini-bust in Zbrush 4 R4. That program's new "grid" option is a useful way to build orthographic image planes. \r

 Mitt Romney was created by Jason.""" ;
