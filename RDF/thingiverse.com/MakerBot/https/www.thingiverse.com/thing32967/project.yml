function: "The race is on! This is an exciting election, and we're running an unofficial poll here on Thingiverse. Download these and we'll keep track of who has the leading edge. If you're able to vote in the US, make a miniature of your favorite candidate and bring him into the voting booth with you. If you're a Thingiverse user outside the US, your download counts, too! \r\n\r\nThese Obama + Romney Busts are currently available in the MakerBot Store in New York City. \r\n\r\nDesigner's Note:\r\nTo design this portrait of Mitt Romney, I started with a base mesh built in Maya and worked off of several good reference images. There are actually many \"human\" base meshes out there for free download. I sculpted this mini-bust in Zbrush 4 R4. That program's new \"grid\" option is a useful way to build orthographic image planes. \r\n\r\n\r\n Mitt Romney was created by Jason."
