function: "The Peakton Estate is a fine example of the traditional Peakton style of architecture. The original settlers of the bucolic village eschewed the use of straight lines, instead taking their aesthetic cues from the wild angles of the surrounding mountains.  \n\nCombine with GeoHouse, Elf Hut, and Cobble Cottage for the whole set!  \n   \nCreated by: Jason"
