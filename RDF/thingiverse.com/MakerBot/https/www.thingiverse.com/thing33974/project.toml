function = "After centuries of being packed like sardines in long rows of bunkbeds in Santa's North Pole Dormitories for Seasonal Employees, the bearded benefactor, realizing the value of his loyal, if diminutive, workforce, ordered construction on a series of huts. Each hut was designed to house two (2) elves. However, the elves seem to prefer living in groups of seven (7). After so many years of interaction with elves, Santa knew better than to inquire as to a reason.\r\n\r\nCombine with Peakton Estate, Cobble Cottage, and GeoHouse for the whole set!\r\n\r\nCreated by: Jason"
