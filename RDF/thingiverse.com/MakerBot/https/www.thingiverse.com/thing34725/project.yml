function: "The hobby of building model cars probably dates back to the beginning of cars, when fake cars and real cars had about the same amount of horsepower. These days, with a MakerBot, you can make yourself any kind of model you want. This one reminds us of roads outside New York City, where cars go lightning fast. Or, at least faster than pedestrians. Make one today, and start dreaming up the next piece in your collection. \r\n\r\nCreated by Chris / Matt"
