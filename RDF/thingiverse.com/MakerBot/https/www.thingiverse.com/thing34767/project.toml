function = "This Star Ornament is based on a small stellated dodecahedron. It's basically festive math.\r\n\r\nCombine this piece with the Spaceship and Round MakerBot Ornaments, and sprinkle in a full set of the Snowflake Ornaments. Each is modeled with a hole for a string or hook. If you're feeling extra crafty, feel free to prime and paint these for a personal touch.\r\n\r\nCreated by Todd"
