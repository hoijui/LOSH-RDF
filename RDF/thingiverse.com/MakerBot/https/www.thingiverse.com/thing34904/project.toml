function = "It may have taken decades to build the giant stone circle at Stonehenge in England, but this one goes together in a few minutes. This 18-piece set requires you to correctly place the stones around the grounds and ponder what the original intent of this sacred space may have been. First solve the puzzle by correctly joining the ground pieces together, and then place the stones. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nCreated by Jason / Matt"
