function: "This board is the brains behind the Generation 3 Electronics. The heart is a Sanguino which is an Arduino-compatible board that is powered by an ATMEGA644P chip. It has connectors to hook up all the various peripherals that you'll need to drive a RepRap machine. It has headers for three stepper drivers, as well as 4 RJ45 connectors for Extruder Controller Boards. Not only that, but it has an SD card and a connector to hook it up to an ATX power supply.\r\n\r\nSome highlights:\r\n\r\n    * Onboard atmega644p - 64K flash space, 4k ram, 32 I/O pins, Arduino compatible.\r\n    * 3 x Stepper driver connectors with min/max inputs.\r\n    * Built-in SD card socket for printing from file and buffering large print jobs.\r\n    * RS485 connection for noise-free communications with extruder / toolhead controllers.\r\n    * ATX power connector for power. It can also turn the power supply on and off.\r\n    * Headers to allow existing Sanguinos to plug straight in.\r\n    * I2C headers for simple hookup of external peripherals.\r\n    * On/Off switch for instant-kill and simple control of the entire system."
