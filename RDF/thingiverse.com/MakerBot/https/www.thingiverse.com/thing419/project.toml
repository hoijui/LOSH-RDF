function = "This is the plastic extruder that we have developed over at MakerBot Industries.  It is a primarily lasercut design which uses a pinch-wheel filament drive system and a nichrome heating element.  It is heavily based on work we've done with the RepRap project and is compatible with the RepRap mounting system.\r\n\r\nYou can buy kits for this at the MakerBot Store: http://store.makerbot.com/featured-products/plastruder-kit-presale.html"
