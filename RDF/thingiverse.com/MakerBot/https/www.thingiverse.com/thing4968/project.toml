The Arduino MEGA provides the USB interface, and the motherboard has an SD card slot for storage. For motion control, it has headers for 5 stepper drivers, so it can drive your XYZ positioning system and have room left over for controlling 2 extra stepper motors. Along with steppers, it has headers for 6 endstop cables (X+/-, Y+/-, Z+/-) and an e-stop switch. The interface connector is can be connected to an interface board for controlling the machine without a computer.
