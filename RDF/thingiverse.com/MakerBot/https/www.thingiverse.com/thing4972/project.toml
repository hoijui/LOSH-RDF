function = "Integrated heat, temperature sensting, and motor control\r\n\r\nThe Thingomatic Heater Board is mashup of innovative 3D printing techniques. The heater board fulfils a number of roles in the Thingomatic. First, it provides a nice, flat printing surface with mounting holes. Second, the PCB itself is one large, flat heater which provides very even heating across the surface. Third, the PCB includes an on-board thermistor which allows the board to measure its own temperature. Last, but not least, the PCB includes a header for connecting it to the rest of the MakerBot electronics so that you can easily wire it up."
