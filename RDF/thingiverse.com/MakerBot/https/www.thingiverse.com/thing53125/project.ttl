    okh:function """Based on the excellent work of Thingiverse users whpthomas, emmett, and whosawhatsis, this design incorporates a spring-loaded arm to squeeze the filament between the drive gear and a bearing with a constant amount of pressure. We added improvements to the designs, such as a hole below the drive gear to guide the filament into the hot end.\r
\r
MakerBot Replicator 2 owners will love the ease of this system for keeping filament running smoothly, and we salute the innovative MakerBot users who contributed to this design!\r
\r
UPDATE! The hardware parts for this replacement are available for sale in our online store. Go to http://store.makerbot.com/drive-block-hardware-kit.html.\r
\r
UPDATE! Rev2 files are now uploaded, and there are STEP files for anyone who would like to take a closer look at the design. There is also a version of the Base that can print without support material.""" ;
