function = "The MakerBot Gen4 Interface board is a DIY addition to your MakerBot that will allow you to interact directly with the machine. It has multiple buttons, multiple LEDs, and a 16x4 character LCD screen to provide feedback directly to you. Using this board, it is possible to run your MakerBot completely independently with no computer attached. You can set and read the temperature, view the progress of a build, and even start a new build from a file stored on the SD card. Of course you can also hack the firmware to make it anything else you might want as well.\r\n\r\nThis kit is DIY, and soldering is required. All the components are through-hole so it is a great kit for beginners."
