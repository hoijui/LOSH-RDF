function: This is a new board we've developed as the standard endstop board for MakerBot.  Mechanical switches are simpler to activate (just bump into them) and they are pretty reliable. The switch we sourced is rated for 1,000,000 (one MEEEELION) cycles.  We've designed the board to be compatible / interchangeable with the Opto Endstop boards by putting the same spacing for the mounting holes.  It also uses the same connector as the Opto Endstop v3.0 and Stepper Motor Driver v3.0 boards.
