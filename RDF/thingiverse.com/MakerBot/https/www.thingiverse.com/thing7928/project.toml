function = "The MakerBot Stepstruder MK6+ is just what you'd think -- all the direct-driven, controllable, torquey goodness of the MK6, with an added plus!  \r\nThat plus is a new, quicker-heating aluminum heater core, powered by a custom-made cartridge heater.  In addition to faster heating performance, the MK6 Plus is easier to put together and has fewer points of potential failure."
