function = "The foot of the couch broke while moving it. This is a replacement. I attempted to optimize it so that it did not use a lot of material, yet would still be strong. Created with Autodesk 123D.\r\n\r\nStill tweaking the geometry. The taper holding the top spindle was supposed to add lateral strength, but it has not been successful so far."
