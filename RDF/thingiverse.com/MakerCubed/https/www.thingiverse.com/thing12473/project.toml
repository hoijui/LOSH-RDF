So next time you have a 3D printer party (I know you guys do!), make sure you make a few of these...cheers!\r\n\r\nNot totally sure this would work yet since my Prusa Mendel is not here yet :(, but let me know if it does (or doesn't...)\r\n\r\nJust wanted to make something fun to start with when I do eventually get my Prusa Mendel...\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I remade this from scratch (again) in OpenSCAD so it's now Parametric and super precise...and you can fiddle with it. Also, the new version in OpenSCAD is a little different that these renderings.\r\n\r\nUsed some code for the logo shape made by raldrich http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11944"
