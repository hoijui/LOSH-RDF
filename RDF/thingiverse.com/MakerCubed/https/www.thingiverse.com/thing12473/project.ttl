\r
Not totally sure this would work yet since my Prusa Mendel is not here yet :(, but let me know if it does (or doesn't...)\r
\r
Just wanted to make something fun to start with when I do eventually get my Prusa Mendel...\r
\r
UPDATE: I remade this from scratch (again) in OpenSCAD so it's now Parametric and super precise...and you can fiddle with it. Also, the new version in OpenSCAD is a little different that these renderings.\r
\r
Used some code for the logo shape made by raldrich http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11944""" ;
