function = "I made this to start making some custom housings and mounts for the Go Pro Hero camera ( http://gopro.com/ ).\r\n\r\nThis is not intended to be printed (although I guess you can if you really want) but is meant to building things for it and testing if it'll fit. This model is just the camera itself without the original waterproof housing that usually comes with the camera. Also includes the placement of the connectors, buttons and openings that may be important.\r\n\r\nI commented everything in OpenSCAD so you can turn things off easily and an \"extrude\" value to make the features stick out of the body father for better reference.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's pretty accurate (used my own camera's measurements), so it should get you extremely close.\r\n\r\nUntil I fully test it, I'll leave it as \"Experimental\"... Look for some cool housing designs soon..."
