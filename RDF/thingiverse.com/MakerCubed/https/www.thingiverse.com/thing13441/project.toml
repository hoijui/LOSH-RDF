function = "Just made this to pinpoint any issue with my Prusa Mendel. It should work to test out any machine (in theory of course).\r\n\r\nI created a 140mm one (since my calipers only go to 150mm) to check my Prusa Mendel, but I made one at 90mm too for the MakeBots out there.\r\n\r\nThe circle (which is half the size: 140mm object = 70mm circle) should be pretty hi-res so you can check if your belts are loose and stuff.\r\n\r\nThis also helps check the level of your build platform.\r\n\r\nI used this object to really fine tuning my printer and seems to get things more accurate when measuring a printed object than just the carriage movements."
