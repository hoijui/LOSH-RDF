function: "I made this to test a few things on my Prusa Mendel, including speed, feed rate, belts and platform level. Although I made for testing purposes it's pretty fun to watch because it has a long continuous print when it does the edges.\r\n\r\nI included the Cinema 4D file just in case someone wants to tweak it."
