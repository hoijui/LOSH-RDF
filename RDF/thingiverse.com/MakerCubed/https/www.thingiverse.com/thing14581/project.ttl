\r
With my print, I didn't even have to tie the clamps (feet) of the holder to the rods. The snug fit seems to hold it pretty well in place.\r
\r
Also took out a little plastic from the center of the spool hub area to save on some material.\r
\r
This was a rough mod so please excuse the sloppiness, I didn't have time to make the openscad code all nice and neat, but still wanted to share it. \r
\r
Also threw in that filament guide I have in the picture, in which you will have to drill a hole because I didn't add it in the files.""" ;
