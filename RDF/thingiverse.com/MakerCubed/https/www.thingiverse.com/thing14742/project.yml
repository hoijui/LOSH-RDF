function: "I didn't find any Arduino MEGA 2560 (& RAMPS) mounting for the bars of a Prusa Mendel that I liked so....I made my own. I've been trying to get rid of all the wood on my Prusa Mendel (Makergear) and this was the last piece to replace. Hope someone finds the useful.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nSimple design, but somewhat pretty\r\nHas a side with holes (7mm apart) that can be used for accessories or to zip tie cables.\r\nCan be installed anywhere, bar clamps are only on one side.\r\nSomewhat parametric, you can change some stuff in the openSCAD."
