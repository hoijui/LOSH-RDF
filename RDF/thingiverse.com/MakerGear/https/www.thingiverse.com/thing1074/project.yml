function: "The goal is to be able to drop in an off-the-shelf plastic frosting bag and go. The shaft squeezes the bag and out goes the frosting. This design is functional but still needs work. The metal tip and plastic nozzle are available at hobby and grocery stores. The rest of the stuff (except for the motor) were sourced from my misc. parts bin. Not sure where the gears originated but they shouldn\\'t be hard to find (or replace).\r\n\r\nThe treads are lasered into the plywood. The squeezing mechanism is new, the frame is derived from Will\\'s."
