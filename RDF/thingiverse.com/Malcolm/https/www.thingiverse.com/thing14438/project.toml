function = "I looked for a filament splicer â€œthingiâ€x9d without finding much.  So I knocked this one up.  Surprisingly - it seems to work!\r\nItâ€™s based on having a hot tongue to lick the filament ends and butt them up while they are hot and sweaty.  The re-shaping of the filament takes place by being forced through a PTFE tube while itâ€™s still malleable â€“ basically at the same time as the buttering up takes place."
