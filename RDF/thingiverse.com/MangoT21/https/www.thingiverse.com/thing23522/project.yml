function: "A frame for mounting a webcam to the Replicator.  The frame has a lipped edge to fit into the top, bottom and chamfered corner of the open left side of the bot, but It can slide anywhere along the sides or front for fine tuning the placement.  Additionally, a generic-sized sliding camera mount to affix the webcam to the frame. We hold the mount in position vertically with pins into the ABS and shim the camera in the mount with tissue to lock down the angles.\r\n\r\nOur bot is live to the web at www.justin.tv/bot14me2"
