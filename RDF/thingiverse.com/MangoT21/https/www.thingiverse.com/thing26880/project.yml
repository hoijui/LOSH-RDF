function: "The macroline fittings on the stock replicator extruder bracket began to weaken and flex. (see picture of my stock part.) This caused an annoying creaking noise, and also weakened the filament within the macroline feed tube. This eventually caused the filament to mis-feed and even fracture.\r\n\r\nSo, I took the .stl file from the replicator build files and shrunk the holes down to accept paintball style macroline fittings. These fittings are much beefier and thread in through the full thickness of the extruder bracket. This should create a stronger and more durable connection that will last.\r\n\r\nI also had to move the holes about 1/10 inch back from the front of the machine to center the holes over the extruder entry holes. The stock macroline connectors have a much looser tolerance so they can stand to be slightly off center. Whereas my macroline fittings need to be better centered to work.\r\n\r\nAdded benefit? You can choose any color you like to print this in! :)"
