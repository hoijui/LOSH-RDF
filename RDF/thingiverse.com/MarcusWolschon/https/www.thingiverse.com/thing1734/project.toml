function = "bed-spring_4off from the RepRap Mendel has a very short area behind the teardrop that causes the part to fail if the filament does not stick perfectly.\r\nI made that area somewhat longer to improve print-reliability.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provided photo of this failure was done on a properly calibrated RepMan with 0.25mm layer-heigh and usualy extremely good prints. So\r\nI guess this issue is much worse on the majority of RepRaps and Makerbots."
