function = "I like the DC Fan holder.\r\nTransporting my Thing-O-Matic often I choose a very wide and long fan instead,\r\nso it would never break of. (40x50 instead of 40x40 and 32mm thick with 2 fans and 2 motors)\r\nMine also uses a very strange bolt-size of M3.5 .\r\nThis required a redesign.\r\nI am using 2 flat pieces on either end of the fan\r\ninstead of housing this large thing inside the DC fan holder.\r\nMy clamp-arm is not parallel to the wood but starting at 4mm and ending at 5.\r\nThis way it will clamp more securely and with more force.\r\n\r\nTo still attach it easily I tapered the arm by 2mm\r\n(and the bolt holes by my usual 1mm).\r\n\r\nThe arm is also not as long as the fan.\r\nWith the fan 10mm wider, the arm would get in the way of the Z-endstop.\r\nThus it ends 15mm short of the back wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nblog post:\r\n\r\nhttp://marcuswolschon.blogspot.com/2011/05/thing-o-matic-cooling-z-stepper.html"
