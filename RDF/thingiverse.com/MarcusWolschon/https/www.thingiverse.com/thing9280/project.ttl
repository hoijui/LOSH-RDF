https://www.youmagine.com/designs/pcb-routing-build-platform-for-thing-o-matic/  

Reasons:  
http://marcuswolschon.blogspot.de/2014/01/leaving-thingiverse.html   

This is an alternative build-platform for the Thing-o-Matic.  
(May also fit the Cupcake, You'll have to try.)  

Using the ABP-quick-release ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8878 )  
you can quickly switch your automated build platform for this platform and using  
the Repman toolhead adapter ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8738 )  
and Dremel Milling Toolhead ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1703 )  
you can start milling PCBs.  

Make mechanics, enclosures AND electronics on your desktop factory!  

I'm currently preparing a video explaining all the steps  
from printing the parts down to setting up VIsolate  
for optimized voronoi milling and then actually  
milling a spare Thing-o-Matic end-stop.  

This is already version 1.2 of the platform while I used version 1.1 .  
The difference is that you can level the platform using 4 small bolts now.
