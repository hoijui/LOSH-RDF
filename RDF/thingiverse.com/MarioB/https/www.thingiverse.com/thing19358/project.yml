function: "This is a Tequila Tray for people who love to be organized and have everything at its place. It also makes a perfect gift for the Tequila fans among your friends. This little tray has slots for the shot glass, the salt and the lemon. You can even personalize it by adding a 3D text on the corner.\r\n\r\nIt made a fitting gift for my sister in law and got people interested in 3D printing so it's also a good conversation starter ;)."
