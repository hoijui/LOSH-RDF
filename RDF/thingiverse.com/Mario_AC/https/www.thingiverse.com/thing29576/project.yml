function: "Mars Rover. Here is a new Mars Rover design created from OOML (Oriented-Object Mechanical Library). A very easy way to develop prototypes!\r\n\r\nThis design uses a double printed bearing and two springs. Also, it is ready to be controlled by an Arduino UNO or a SkyMega microcontroller, with a place for the battery. This Mars Rover uses Futaba S3003 servos and a Bluetooth module. All these components are important because of the shape of the parts; however, you can modify it and buy your own prototype. With OOML tool modification of design is very simple!\r\n\r\nOriented-Object Mechanical Library is a new mechanical design tool, based on C++, which makes it easier for users to share designs, besides acquiring the power of this language.\r\n\r\nWhether you know C++ programming or not, I encourage you to test it. Take a look at http://iearobotics.com/oomlwiki/doku.php?id=start\r\n\r\nI attach the OOML, OpenSCAD and STL files, besides the Autocad planes. The OpenSCAD files are results of compiling the OOML file, so these codes are uncommented.\r\n\r\nYou can see a video of the prototype in the next link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCLwgrm9mkM\r\n\r\nThe Mars Rover has been designed by:\r\n\r\nAlberto Valero:\r\nthingiverse.com/avalero\r\n\r\nMario Almagro:\r\nthingiverse.com/Mario_AC"
