function = "Polycarbonate is great stuff to mill but the little gritty swarf gets everywhere. I also find that my 1/16\" bits tend to wind up any strings of polycarbonate and eventually build up enough that they form a little puck of fused plastic around the tip that destroys the work surface.\r\n\r\nI built this attachment to take the tube from my shop vacuum and apply suction right next to the head on the mill. The photos and MP4 show it in action, it works pretty well (for those who are interested, it's cutting 3 mm polycarbonate with a 1/16\" TiCN coated two-flute spiral at 10,500 rpm, feedrate 600 mm / minute).\r\n\r\nThe polycarbonate sheet is being held in version 2 of my laser-cut fixture, previously posted as http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20281"
