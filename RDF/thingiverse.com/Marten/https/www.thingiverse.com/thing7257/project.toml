function = "In Dutch Beer is Bier. In dutch pubs beerglasses are put on coasters called a \"bierviltje\". With the bier_clip you connect bierviltjes to create a 3D-object like domes or so. Pretty useless, but very enjoyable. And Joy lacks a lot of people. So I you want to work on higher status of joy, print a couple, go to a dutch pub and have fun. Don't forget to drink enough though. \r\n\r\n* those are square or round, 10x10x0.2 cm"
