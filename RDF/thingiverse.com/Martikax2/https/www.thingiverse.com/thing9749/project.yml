function: "Small toy, key ring or rattle with loose ball inside impossible to remove. This simple design was specially conceptualized to experiment with MakerBot, since it was not clear how act to stop the ball centered and suspended as was outlined in the Cad file. \r\nThe machine created a thin thread that supported structural and position to the area, could be easily removed with a cutter."
