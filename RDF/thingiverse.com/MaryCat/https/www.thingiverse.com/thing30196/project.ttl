\r
This project is one of many that have been initiated at the University because of the innovation that has led printers Thing-O-Matic, by Department of Systems Engineering and Automation, in the field of robotics. Also it has the objective to test the viability of low cost printable robotics.\r
\r
The objective is to design a vehicle using as main tool the departmentâ€™s 3D printers. To this end, agreed to a free-school course taught at the University Carlos III of Madrid where instructing you the tools, both software and hardware, which is needed to make proper use of printers, design and control robots.\r
\r
This caused a large number of projects related to printable robots. The novelty of this proyect with respect to others is the use of motors DC, as so far all printable robots used servos for both, its movement and its displacement. Moreover, most of them for the actions mentioned and making use of the power units have used differential control, while in this is used directional control, the same that used by commercial vehicles.\r
\r
To control it will use a gamepad, that is to say, a console controller, connected to the computer. With it, anyone can handle the robot intuitively even without any knowledge of robotics. This is due to the great developments that have these controls with the new generation of consoles, which make it a familiar instrument and easy to use.\r
\r
The vehicle used by Bluetooth wireless communication, allowing freer movement of up to 9 meters away to the point of control (computer) through the removal of the cables.\r
\r
The intermediary element receive gamepad orders sent by Bluetooth is the Arduino Leonardo, OpenSource hardware available to everyone, which will process the received data and send the necessary signals to move or react the vehicle.\r
