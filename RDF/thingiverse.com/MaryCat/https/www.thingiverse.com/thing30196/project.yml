Also it has the objective to test the viability of low cost printable robotics.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to design a vehicle using as main tool the department\xE2\u20AC\u2122s 3D printers. To this end, agreed to a free-school course taught at the University Carlos III of Madrid where instructing you the tools, both software and hardware, which is needed to make proper use of printers, design and control robots.\r\n\r\nThis caused a large number of projects related to printable robots. The novelty of this proyect with respect to others is the use of motors DC, as so far all printable robots used servos for both, its movement and its displacement. Moreover, most of them for the actions mentioned and making use of the power units have used differential control, while in this is used directional control, the same that used by commercial vehicles.\r\n\r\nTo control it will use a gamepad, that is to say, a console controller, connected to the computer. With it, anyone can handle the robot intuitively even without any knowledge of robotics. This is due to the great developments that have these controls with the new generation of consoles, which make it a familiar instrument and easy to use.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle used by Bluetooth wireless communication, allowing freer movement of up to 9 meters away to the point of control (computer) through the removal of the cables.\r\n\r\nThe intermediary element receive gamepad orders sent by Bluetooth is the Arduino Leonardo, OpenSource hardware available to everyone, which will process the received data and send the necessary signals to move or react the vehicle.\r\n\r\nP.D: Sorry for my English"
