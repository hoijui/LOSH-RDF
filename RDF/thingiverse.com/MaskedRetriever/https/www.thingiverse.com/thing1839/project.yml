function: "The Sculpt Mode in Blender has been upgraded pretty significantly for 2.5!\r\n\r\nTo celebrate, I've uploaded some .blend files which are already set up for sculpting.  There'll be a tutorial on the Thingiverse Blog later, but if you've used Blender to do a few things like model scaling, opening one of these in 2.5 should be mostly self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nThe different files represent different shapes to use as start points.  They all have flat bottoms and so they'll at least start out printable!"
