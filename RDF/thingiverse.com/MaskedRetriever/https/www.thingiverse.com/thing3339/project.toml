function = "Download Spider Jerusalem's specs and have your home maker spit out as many pairs as you like!\r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\n\r\nIn the comic Transmetropolitan, Spider Jerusalem is a gonzo journalist of a future where ubiquitous intelligence, nanotech and genetic engineering have transformed the world.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the story, he arrives in the City with a staff reporting gig that gets him the basic necessities for life in the City: an apartment and a Maker.  The Maker in his apartment is basically what we all imagine our RepRaps and MakerBots will one day become: a general assembler.\r\n\r\nHe uses it to fabricate a custom-tailored suit and a pair of glasses with onboard cameras.  Spider's distinctive odd-shaped 3D glasses were made by his maker as a joke, because this being the world of Transmetropolitan, it was stoned.\r\n\r\nBe glad your MakerBot is not on drugs."
