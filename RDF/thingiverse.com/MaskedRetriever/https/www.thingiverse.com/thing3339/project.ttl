Backstory:\r
\r
In the comic Transmetropolitan, Spider Jerusalem is a gonzo journalist of a future where ubiquitous intelligence, nanotech and genetic engineering have transformed the world.\r
\r
At the beginning of the story, he arrives in the City with a staff reporting gig that gets him the basic necessities for life in the City: an apartment and a Maker.  The Maker in his apartment is basically what we all imagine our RepRaps and MakerBots will one day become: a general assembler.\r
\r
He uses it to fabricate a custom-tailored suit and a pair of glasses with onboard cameras.  Spider's distinctive odd-shaped 3D glasses were made by his maker as a joke, because this being the world of Transmetropolitan, it was stoned.\r
\r
Be glad your MakerBot is not on drugs.""" ;
