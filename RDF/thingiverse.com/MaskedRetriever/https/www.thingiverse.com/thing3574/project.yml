function: "Neat little feature in Blender2.5 these days, automated generation of toruses with the polygons twisted.  To make this and other shapes, enable the plugin:\r\n\r\nfile -> user preferences -> add-ons\r\n\r\nThere\\'s a whole bunch of plugins in the Add Mesh category that create great shapes, including a rather impressive platonic solid generator.  Of course you\\'ll need to get a recent build from graphicall.org, which I highly recommend as newer versions are very stable and close to Beta-ready.\r\n\r\nNote on Blender 2.5\\'s .stl support: it is also a plugin you have to enable, and for some reason objects need to be scaled up 5x before exporting.  I have submitted a bug report on this...\r\n\r\nUPDATE! There\\'s nothing wrong with .stl support, but you need to go to apply -> scale if you\\'ve scaled your design in object mode before it will come out properly."
