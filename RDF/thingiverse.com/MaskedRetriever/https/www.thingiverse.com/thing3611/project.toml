function = "Skeinforge can take a looong time for very complex meshes, so I'm fiddling with ways to do things faster.  So far all I've got is a slice viewer that lets you see just the plane intersections of the mesh.  This is very fast, so I intentionally bogged it down with a quarter-of-a-million triangle mesh I made with Blender and the sculpt tool.  I have a version with *huff* One Meeeliyon Triangles, but let's not get nuts just yet."
