function = "SuperSkein is being aggressively prepped for supporting infill, shells, rafts, the whole nine yards.  Meanwhile, your intrepid developers have forked off a variant which will remain simple and lightweight in perpetuity, so that others who wish to try their own infill techniques and variations will have a comparatively lightweight starting point!\r\n\r\nYou can visit SimpleSlice's GitHub page here for the latest and most pared-down variants:\r\nhttp://github.com/MaskedRetriever/SimpleSlice\r\n\r\n(SimpleSlice will only get MORE lightweight, not less.  SuperSkein is where such niceties as variable extrusion speed, wipes, infill, etc will be added.)"
