function = "The idea here is that you could print out N chain links, and then snap them together to form a chain.  If they can work as printed with minimal post-processing (like, maybe you pick at them a little) then it shouldn't be *too* hard to make big long chains for things like mechanical linkages or clock chains.  (We'll probably need to change the inside edges a bit.)"
