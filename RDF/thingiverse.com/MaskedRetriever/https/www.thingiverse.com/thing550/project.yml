function: "Painting the dice in the dice pack I designed when I got on Thingiverse might be pretty cool, but we're really not capitalizing on the full power of digital fabrication if we don't at least get indentations showing the point value of the dice.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think this may be a case where Sketchup will beat Blender hands down, given what I've seen happening with bracelets, so I gave up after these for the time being, in case someone comes along and gets the d20 done in half an hour."
