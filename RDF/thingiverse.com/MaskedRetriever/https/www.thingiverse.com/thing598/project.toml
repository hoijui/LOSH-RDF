function = "A fix on a student's 3D-ification of part of the MakerBot Plastruder.\r\n\r\nHere's my fixes:\r\n\r\n1: Used the Blender command \"remove doubles\" to get rid of what looks like about 3000 extra vertices, and re-calculated normals for good measure.  (Both steps are always a good idea when working with stuff made from CAD files.)\r\n2: Scaled up by ten-- I think this model may have been done at 1 Blender Unit per centimeter when the scale for skeinforge is 1 Blender Unit per millimeter."
