function: "Still a work in progress, as I want there to be MANY mane and tail styles and possibly a couple different poses (with associated translate keys to move the wings, horn, ears, etc) but as it is, you can definitely print ponies with or without manes and tail (I figure drill holes would be best for implanting hair), and swap in a horn or wings for pegasi, unicorns and alicorns.\r\n\r\nUpdate: there are now three mane types, and three tail types.  The mane/tail combos were made together, but with mix-and-match this is a total of 36 possible designs, not counting \"blanking\" the mane and tail to make ponies which are \"doll hair ready\"."
