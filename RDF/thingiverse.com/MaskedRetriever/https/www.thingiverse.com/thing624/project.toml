function = "Well, to be more technical, the flanged sliding bearing and the plastic spacer from the kit.\r\n\r\nI noticed a couple of parts in my MakerBot kit that looked like obvious printables, so in the time while I'm waiting for my remaining parts, I bodged up STL files for 'em.  I'm not sure if it even ends up being economical to print these rather than buy them in the truckloads the MakerBot team will be getting them, but for the sake of quickly obtaining spares and for the general RepRap-ability of the system, it seemed worth the five minutes of modeling time.\r\n\r\nPlus, how can having an infinite supply of arbitrary-thickness board spacers be a bad thing?"
