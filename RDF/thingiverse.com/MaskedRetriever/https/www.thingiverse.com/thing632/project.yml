function: "Turns the MakerBot addative CNC machine into a subtractive CNC machine!\r\n\r\n(Well, assuming it works)\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly hacky-looking first cut, but it slices and I can't see any *severe* mechanical failings.  I figure this one can run under the \"get out the door quickly, then iterate\" model.\r\n\r\nI'm including the blender file, which has in it a caliper-captured model of the Dremel tool.  It's not the most precise model ever but I think it's accurate enough where it counts to ensure a snug fit."
