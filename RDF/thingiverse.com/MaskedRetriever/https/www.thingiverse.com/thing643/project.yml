function: "My kit was missing the pulley assemblies, so with a kick in the pants from Thingiverse user and DorkBotPDX awesomeness provider Andrew Parnell, I took to the task of rolling my own with hardware store parts.\r\n\r\nI've decided that they look so cool I'm going to keep them unless it's later proven that they somehow harm performance.\r\n\r\nEDIT! Zach points out that original designs running on this had problems with the belt rubbing the washers and ultimately fraying.  Only use this method if you, like me, are up z-stage creek without a pulley assembly and need something that'll work for a little while.\r\n\r\nAndrew Parnell's awesome things are here:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/asp55"
