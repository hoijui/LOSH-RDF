http://web.media.mit.edu/~plusea/\r
\r
And decided it was high time to make a 3D printable speaker prototype.  I turned the basic design of a speaker upside down and put the coil on the bottom to simplify construction.  (With magnets being as strong as they are lately this is probably fine.)\r
\r
You'll need a strong, light magnet (the little cube ones from makerbot are probably ideal) paper, and magnet wire.\r
\r
Once my ToM is constructed, I'll edit in my experimental results, patterns for paper, updates, etc.""" ;
