function: "I got inspired by the Kit of No Parts:\r\nhttp://web.media.mit.edu/~plusea/\r\n\r\nAnd decided it was high time to make a 3D printable speaker prototype.  I turned the basic design of a speaker upside down and put the coil on the bottom to simplify construction.  (With magnets being as strong as they are lately this is probably fine.)\r\n\r\nYou'll need a strong, light magnet (the little cube ones from makerbot are probably ideal) paper, and magnet wire.\r\n\r\nOnce my ToM is constructed, I'll edit in my experimental results, patterns for paper, updates, etc."
