function: "Stars, Fractals, and Gears, this update's all about manipulating groups of GCodes to produce complex geometry!\r\n\r\nThis is probably about as spaghettified as I'm willing to let the code get-- next script update will finally be modularized into tidy packages.  Scripts in the next pack will also be able to take command-line arguments.\r\n\r\npara_07: Star.  Demonstrates a list of GCodes, which can then be manipulated together.\r\n\r\npara_08: The Koch Snowflake.  Demonstrates a recursive function which draws a Koch Snowflake.  This could be modified to construct a wide variety of 2D fractals.  My algorithm isn't the cleanest version of this, however; a better one is on Wikipedia here:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake\r\n\r\npara_09: Simple Gears.  The gear script's a little beta-y right now but I decided to just post it as-is rather than let it hold up the script packs."
