\r
This hasn't been tested in situ yet, but I'm pretty confident that the underhang design will put the belt slipping issue to bed.  Tuck the hook under the y-stage with the belt between the main bar and the ribs, and the screw should now be effectively applying pressure at *both* ends of the belt, as well as physically blocking it from moving down.\r
\r
Getting that hole to print is annoying but I got it right once in my pre-tests...""" ;
