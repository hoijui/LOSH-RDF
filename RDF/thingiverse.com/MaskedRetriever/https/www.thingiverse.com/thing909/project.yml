function: "I wanted a teacup shape to match the Utah Teapot, largely because my coffee clatch liked the teapot so much.\r\n\r\nI tried to make the Utah Teacup share some design resonance with the Utah Teapot: the handle looks a bit like the Utah Teapot's handle, and the curve of the cup mimics the curve of the sides.\r\n\r\nAt the scale stored in the file, this cup is useless for beverages, but at twice this size it'd be decent for shots, and scaled up to barely fit in the build area it might make a passable mug, although I have my doubts about really piping-hot tea...\r\n\r\nNote: Unlike the Utah Teapot, the Utah Teacup was designed with 3D printing in mind from the beginning, and is fully manifold.  Because none of the things that are non-manifold about the Utah Teapot break Skeinforge, this is a more or less academic distinction, but it does give you fewer warnings."
