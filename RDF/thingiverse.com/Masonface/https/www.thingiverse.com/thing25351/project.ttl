    okh:function """This is a foot for the Ultimaker 3D printer which has a long tubular support to contact flush against the recessed bottom of the machine for extra stability and strength. It has a semi-circular channel carved out to accommodate the wires from the stepper motors and printhead to the control board. This part is meant to be used in tandem with a rubber damper to reduce vibration and sound to the surface that the printer may be sitting on. This has a marked impact on reducing noise when printing on top of a wooden table.\r
\r
This design is loosely based on   http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17770 by Maurits.\r
\r
It is more inspired by the suggestion of Jaydmdigital on the page of: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14802""" ;
