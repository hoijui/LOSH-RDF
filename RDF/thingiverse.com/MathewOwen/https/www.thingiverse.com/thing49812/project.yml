function: Lasercut Waffle Structure Laptop Stand. Easy to use press-fit connections. Feel free to use it as you wish! It works great! I made it for my wife, whose laptop overheats whenever using photoshop or rendering an image. The design is based on being as open as possible to allow air to freely pass through on all sides and optimally cool down the device. Test it out for your self  if you have access to a laser or cnc router. More variants can be found at http://www.lasercuttinglab.com
