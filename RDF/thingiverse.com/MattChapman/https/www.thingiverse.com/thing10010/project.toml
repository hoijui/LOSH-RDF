function = "Yes, another cookie cutter. One of my first experiments with openscad. This script takes a shape like a thumbtack and moves it along a generated 2d star shaped pattern, thus creating a cookie cutter. \r\n\r\nNumber of points, inner diameter, and outer diameter are adjustable.\r\n\r\nPossibly a good example of moving a shape along a path (via the minkowski command)."
