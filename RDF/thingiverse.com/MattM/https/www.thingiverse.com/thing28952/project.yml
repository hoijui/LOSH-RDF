function: "Rather than just having one of every piece, I copied all of the pieces required for a single person to play to a new sheet...duplicating as needed.  \r\n\r\nFor a nice themed container for your pieces, see: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29656\r\n\r\nThanks to http://www.thingiverse.com/emphes for his creative work on the original set.\r\n\r\nI've ended up modestly redesigning several of the pieces. The first STL below is the original sheet, revisions 1-9 had major changes, and then 9A-9F are tiny refinements to optimize print quality/time."
