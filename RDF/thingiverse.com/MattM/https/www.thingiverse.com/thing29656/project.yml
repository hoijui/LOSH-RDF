function: "Should be big enough to hold all the pieces from the castle chess set (both players) - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28952 \r\n\r\nTinkercad Link: https://tinkercad.com/things/7VgcBmeF10n-castle-chess-set-container\r\n\r\nCreated it as a giveaway toy for my son's 10th birthday.  \r\n\r\nI've gone through a few design revisions trying to get a perfect print.  The last and final revision has been uploaded and the prior ones removed (apologies for any defects in the prior -- sometimes tinkercad designs just need more iterations).  I've also removed some text from tinkercad design that wouldn't be applicable to others."
