    okh:function """I was looking for a while for some cool portal related things other than the companion cube so I made my own. Pick your version you want to print and enjoy.\r
\r
"Portal" has a concave circle. The stl image doesn't show the other side. \r
\r
"Portal 2" has a slightly more realistic look (my second version of it). The inside of it is also concaved but is a bit difference. Download both to get an idea of what each is and pick your favorite. \r
\r
The images of both in writing form are below. They show the inside of the portal. Also, the thumbnail is the full size version of the outlined version.\r
\r
If anyone wants something else cool done with it, just leave a comment, thanks! Also when I say Portal 2 I'm not referring to the game, I'm simply referring to a different version of the portal. \r
\r
Edit: I added an outlined version of the "Portal 2" version. It is to save plastic and also reduce the chances of warping when printing with ABS.""" ;
