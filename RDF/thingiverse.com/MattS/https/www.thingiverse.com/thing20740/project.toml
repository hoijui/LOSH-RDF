I found Datafusions card holder and printed it out. All excited I slapped it on my bot to find that the new thicker wood on the Replicator made it a real tight fit. OpenSCAD to the rescue. I quickly mocked up a new one and thought you might like it too.\r\n\r\nWarning this device will not prevent loss of data due to Gator Attack!"
