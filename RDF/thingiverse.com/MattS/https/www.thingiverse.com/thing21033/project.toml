function = "My wife and I both use Crest Spinbrush toothbrushes but our new bathroom doesn't have a great place to set them. We decided to use a little soap dish alcove but out toothbrushes kept falling over and onto the floor. It was time for a solution. Modeled in OpenSCAD this holder will fit 2 toothbrushes and give them a solid base to not fall over."
