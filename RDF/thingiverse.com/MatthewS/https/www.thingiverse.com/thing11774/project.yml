function: This is a smiley face keychain that was designed in Autodesk Inventor Pro 2012. It was printted on the Makerbot Thing-O-Matic using ABS plastic. The design created to test the Makerbot's ability to print indents in the object. The features of the face have fillet to make it easier for the Makerbot to print them. The object also has a hole on top for the owner to drill a hole for a key chain ring to fit through. There is also a name on the top for ease of identification.
