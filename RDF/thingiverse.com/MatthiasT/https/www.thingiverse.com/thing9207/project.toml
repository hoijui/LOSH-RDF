Often I went to McDO, Bking etc..\r\n\r\nBut after a while you start to notice some things\r\n- it's not the most healthy option\r\n- you don't know exactly what's in that sometimes weird looking burger\r\n- price compared to quality it's not always that great \r\n\r\nThis got me thinking with this result: I like to present to you Burgalicious. For your own homemade burgers.\r\n- depending on how you cook it can be much healthier \r\n- you know yourself what the burger is made of. It can be anything from meat, fish, to potato's or veggie replacements.\r\n- for the price of a commercial burger you can make 2 or 3 maybe even more.\r\n\r\nIt's designed so it can be cleaned easily, I printed it in plain white so it can be inspected after cleaning ."
