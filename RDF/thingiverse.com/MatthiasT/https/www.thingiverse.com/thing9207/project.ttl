\r
But after a while you start to notice some things\r
- it's not the most healthy option\r
- you don't know exactly what's in that sometimes weird looking burger\r
- price compared to quality it's not always that great \r
\r
This got me thinking with this result: I like to present to you Burgalicious. For your own homemade burgers.\r
- depending on how you cook it can be much healthier \r
- you know yourself what the burger is made of. It can be anything from meat, fish, to potato's or veggie replacements.\r
- for the price of a commercial burger you can make 2 or 3 maybe even more.\r
\r
It's designed so it can be cleaned easily, I printed it in plain white so it can be inspected after cleaning .""" ;
