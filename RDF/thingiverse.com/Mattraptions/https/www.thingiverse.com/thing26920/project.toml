It is exactly on model, with reference from PIXAR's own digital data and is built accordingly to the short Luxo Jr. \r\n\r\nHis bulb is vacuum formed polystyrene and he is lit by 4 super brite LEDS and powered by one CR2032 battery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got the files from Jon @ google sketchup and after splitting up the entire components, converting everything to .STL, I had it 3D printed at Tech Shop. \r\n\r\nhttp://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=c778a6ac6cf0c81d4904d89e9169817b"
