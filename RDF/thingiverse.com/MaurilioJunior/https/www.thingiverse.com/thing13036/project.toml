function = "Now the software is ready to do the design of belts for cupcake abpv1.0 or others. \r\n\r\nIn \"angle mode\", use 246 mm, in glue mode use 239 mm, just dont ask me \"why...\"\r\n\r\nWell, I tryed very lengths, but what fit exactly with AB is 239 x 84 in glue mode (high temperature silicone glue). But need some hack in motor that need to polish with emery wheel of dremel where the belt shoud contact. Make the belt, put a little bit of glue over rectangles of glue, fits and wait one or two day to install (silicone glue needs time).\r\n\r\nOther option, that is better is attach by a hot flat plate. That I use."
