I designed it specifically for a Brownie Movie Projector, made by Kodak, but it could work for other projectors(?).\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nSidenote: This thing could use an adjustment here or there to really be optimal...but it works well enough for me to not want to bother tightening it up.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
