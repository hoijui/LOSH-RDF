function: "This is an apparatus designed to allow three people to conveniently type out a specific phrase: it is as it is\r\n\r\nEach person must time their actions specifically, and operate their portion of the device with care.\r\n\r\nThis device was made to be a performance at a local art-event. Its operation is (of course) far from convenient, but it does type out the most true thing I have ever known."
