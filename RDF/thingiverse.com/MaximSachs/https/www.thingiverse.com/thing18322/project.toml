function = "I just wanted one cup of tea. Buuuut I was too lazy to go into the kitchen. So I just printed one. It is made up of two parts. The container and its cap, which at least with my print seals up quite well.\r\n\r\nP.s.: I printed it on the RapRapPro Huxley, and sorry for the poor image quality! My Sd card is broken so I needed to use my mobile.\r\n\r\nAttention: I can not guarantee the secure use! I printed it using Pla, but I have no Idea wether it is a harm to our health. If you have any further information regarding that problem, please leave a comment below!\r\n\r\nI'm very sorry, somehow the comment tool doesn't work.. So I post my answer here:\r\n\r\nThank you very much for the information! In boiling water the pla softens, but doesn't melt. There is no visible substance left behind in the water. I can't taste a major difference to normal water. So I will go to see if frequent use changes something."
