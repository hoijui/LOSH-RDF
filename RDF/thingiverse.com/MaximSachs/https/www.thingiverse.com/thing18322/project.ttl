P.s.: I printed it on the RapRapPro Huxley, and sorry for the poor image quality! My Sd card is broken so I needed to use my mobile.\r
\r
Attention: I can not guarantee the secure use! I printed it using Pla, but I have no Idea wether it is a harm to our health. If you have any further information regarding that problem, please leave a comment below!\r
\r
