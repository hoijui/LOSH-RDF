function: "This is a led ring light I build specifically for my Panasonic HDC-SD 909.\r\nIt is a ring of bright leds which surround the camera lens. The inner diameter of it is 7cm the outer diameter is 12cm. The distance to the camera mount is 6 cm. If your camera more or less fits those numbers (+-0,5 cm) you can print it as it is. Otherwise it is easily adjustable. It comes with a build in battery housing, designed by Obijuan.\r\n\r\n48 leds are needed."
