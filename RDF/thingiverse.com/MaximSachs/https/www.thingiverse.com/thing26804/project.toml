function = "I saw a picture of a chess drinking game on the web (see attached pic) and wanted to make my own.  \r\n\r\nSo I quickly modelled the parts and startet printing. Overall there are 32 parts to be printed. I have only printed 20 yet. The others should follow soon.  \r\n\r\nInto the figurines fits a volume of 20 ml. So they are the standard size of a shot. Queen and King are slightly bigger, so they are biig shots! :)  \r\n\r\nFeel free to give critique in the comment section below!  \r\nHave fun, don't drink too much!! :D  \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy my work, I would appreciate a small bitcoin donation to 1MSachsBbZJjBg83nEsTv95oLuQmnmZnGu."
