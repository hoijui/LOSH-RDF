    okh:function """I saw a picture of a chess drinking game on the web (see attached pic) and wanted to make my own.  \r
\r
So I quickly modelled the parts and startet printing. Overall there are 32 parts to be printed. I have only printed 20 yet. The others should follow soon.  \r
\r
Into the figurines fits a volume of 20 ml. So they are the standard size of a shot. Queen and King are slightly bigger, so they are biig shots! :)  \r
