function: "I wanted to have my Galaxy Nexus connected to my bike, just like my navigation-system is connected in my car. So I designed a simple holder that could be assembled only using a couple of cable binders.\r\n\r\nMy Galaxy Nexus clips in perfectly tight. It is not too tight, so you can easyly remove it, but also it is tight enough so you wont loose it hitting bumps on the road.\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ: I am using a protection cover on my Nexus. This specific one: http://goo.gl/hwUIx.\r\nSo all the dimensions are taken with the protection cover on the phone. So just the phone without the cover wont fit! But I assume that most people are using a cover, or know how to adjust the parts, just shorten them by 1 mm or so..\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't upload any fotos of it, because I am currently on vacation, and the bike I have connected it to is back home in germany."
