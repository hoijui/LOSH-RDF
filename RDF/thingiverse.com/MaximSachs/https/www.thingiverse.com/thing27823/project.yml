function: "---UPDATE---  \r\nI finally finished reviewing cleaning up and modifying the model for this Iron Man helmet. All the parts are now cut and oriented in a way that they can be printed supportless (exeption: the hinge mechanism, but it only needs very feew support).  \r\n\r\nIt consists out of 55 different parts that need to be printed. They are all contained in the new Iron Man Helment optimized_v2.zip file.  \r\n--update above--  \r\n\r\nI wanted to print the IronMan Helmet. But I only own an Huxley 3d Printer, which only allows me to print on a platform roughly 13 by 13 cm and about 9 cm high. So at first I wanted to do a small scale version of my model, which by the way is completely by me! I didn't copy anything existing on the web, and I actually think my moddelling has worked out quite nice! The small version has roughly those measures: 11x14x16  \r\n\r\nI implemented a small hinge, to allow the mask to open, just the way it opened in the movies.  \r\n\r\nBut the small version wasn't enough for me, so I scaled it up until a real human had would fit inside. The measures now are 23x30x33.3 cm. There is some room for inserting foam or sth similar, to make wearing it more comfortable.  \r\n\r\nBut now I had the problem that such a large object wouldn't fit on my huxley printing bed. So I split up the model in many small pieces and layed them out in the most efficient way so all parts could be printed on my Huxley.  \r\n\r\nI also uploaded the complete assembled helmet and mask in large scale, if you want to split it up yourself!  \r\n\r\nI hope you like it! Please send pictures of your printout! Thanks! \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy my work, I would appreciate a small bitcoin donation to 1MSachsBbZJjBg83nEsTv95oLuQmnmZnGu. \r\n\r\nAlso please contact me if there are intersections or missing parts! Thanks :)  \r\n\r\n-- Improovement --  \r\nNaarzaul has added an additional piece to the jaw section to add a detail to make it look much more like the original version. You can find it here:  \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33304  \r\n\r\n---ATTENTION!!---  \r\nThe scale of the overall model is a little too big! You should scale it down by about 10 to 15% (some even say 20) to get a better size and save material. Sorry for everyone who has printed it in the large scale.."
