function: "Hi, I want to share with you my universal phone stand design.\r\n\r\nIt holds anything at an angle of 40 degrees and ist best for phones with big screens. The centre of gravity  can be at maximum 60 cm behind the edge you but at the bottom of the stand.\r\n\r\nFor those who have catia, I uploaded the catia file aswell. Have fun.\r\n\r\n--UPDATE--\r\n\r\nHi guys just found out about that awesome tool called limited desolve in blender. Without loosing any detail in the geometry it punched down the filesize to 29kb from originally 2.9mb (that was after my manual cleanup.. catias export was about 60mb big :D)\r\n\r\nI leave both versions uploaded (the v2 is the optimised one) so you can compare if you might want :D"
