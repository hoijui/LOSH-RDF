function: "Hi guys\r\n\r\nif you study aerospace engineering at TUDelft and you are a total badass cause you dont care about the strict law against food and drinks in the lecture room, then you have found the right cupholder to print!\r\n\r\nIt exactly fits our coffeemachine cups (5.4 cm diameter) and is designed to be fit between two tables.\r\n\r\nWhy should you print this? Well as you know our tables are angled so your coffee would slip of it also by attaching the cup holder to the side you have much more free room.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigned in Catia, refined in Blender, Printed on a reprappro huxley."
