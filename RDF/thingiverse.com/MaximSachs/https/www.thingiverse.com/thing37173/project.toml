function = "After seeing the redstone ore from thinkgeek I thought why not print it myselft? So I made some nice models and here you go, your very own printable minecraft ore lamp.  \r\n  \r\nI want to make to make my lamp blue, since its the color of the diamonds, but you can use any color you want. If you use red, it will be exactly like the redstone ore, since they use the same texture pattern. Or maybe try some green for some nice uranium!  \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy my work, I would appreciate a small bitcoin donation to 1MSachsBbZJjBg83nEsTv95oLuQmnmZnGu.\r\n  \r\nInspiration from: http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/eea7/?cpg=cj&ref=&CJURL=&CJID=1511450"
