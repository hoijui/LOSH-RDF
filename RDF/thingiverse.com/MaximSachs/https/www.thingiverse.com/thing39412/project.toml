function = "---UPDATE---  \r\nI have uploaded the crown split into printable parts with max bound dimensions of 13cmx13cmx8.6cm. It can be printed supportless.  \r\n---UPDATE---  \r\nIn germany Carneval is comming up in a couple of month and I thought about a nice costume. Then I stumbled across an image on 9gag of the Lichking crown. I really like it and so it took me the afternoon to complete a nice model.  \r\nI mainly used the 9gag foto as reference.  \r\nI plan on wearing it with a black morph suit and over the suit a black robe. I also want to add a sword and some armor gloves, check my other designs, I will upload them soon, but probably will forget to update this status :D.  \r\nThe .blend file is attached if you want to modify it yourself.  \r\nTriangles: 761464  \r\nNumber of shells:1  \r\nSurface area: 14.01dm2  \r\nVolume: 0.25dm3  \r\nOutbox: 167.7 x 210.8 x 425.7 mm  \r\nProduction cost: ca. 15 euro\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy my work, I would appreciate a small bitcoin donation to 1MSachsBbZJjBg83nEsTv95oLuQmnmZnGu."
