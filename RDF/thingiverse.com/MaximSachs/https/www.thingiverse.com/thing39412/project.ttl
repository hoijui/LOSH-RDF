---UPDATE---  \r
In germany Carneval is comming up in a couple of month and I thought about a nice costume. Then I stumbled across an image on 9gag of the Lichking crown. I really like it and so it took me the afternoon to complete a nice model.  \r
I mainly used the 9gag foto as reference.  \r
I plan on wearing it with a black morph suit and over the suit a black robe. I also want to add a sword and some armor gloves, check my other designs, I will upload them soon, but probably will forget to update this status :D.  \r
