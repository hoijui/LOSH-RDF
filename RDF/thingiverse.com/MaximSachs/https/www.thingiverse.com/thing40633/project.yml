function: "I wanted to have a lenshood for my videocamera.\r\n\r\nThe inner diameter is 7cm. I also uploaded the catia source file, so you can adjust it as needed.\r\n\r\nThe full version and the first halve version have a wall thickness of 2 mm. I also uploaded a 1.5mm version, for those who want to save some material. (About 2 meters of 1.75mm filament per halve)"
