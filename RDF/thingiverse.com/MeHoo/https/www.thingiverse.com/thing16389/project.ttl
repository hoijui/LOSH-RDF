\r
I've redesigned this and uploaded a new version (HBPWireGuide_012.STL)\r
\r
This new design should be much simpler and work just as well if not better.  The three anchors have cut outs to hold the nuts, and should fit snugly on the bottom plate.  The connector is held by the main bar and the wires slide through the opening at the top.  There are two spots to zip tie the wire bundle, and the wire guide is curved to guide them to the correct spot.\r
\r
Here's the kicker.. My second HBP died.  The connector melted through before I finished this first design and it was on it's last leg the whole time I've been printing this week.  The continued heat applied to the already bent pin just finally did it in I guess.  I am sure this design works well, but I am unable to print it myself just yet to test :(  I am soldering wires onto the HBP as we speak, and it should be working soon so I can test this myself.  What this means is that I am not sure what size bolts to use yet, or if I should extend the bolt holes so there is none protruding through the nut.  You'll understand when you see the part.  I might just simply extend the part so the bolts fit perfectly, but until I see it printed, I can't make that call.\r
\r
If someone prints this and likes it, let me know please.  \r
\r
I attached a quick render I did of what it should resemble once printed and installed since I am unable to actually print this just yet.""" ;
