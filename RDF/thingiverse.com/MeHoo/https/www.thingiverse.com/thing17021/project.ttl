    okh:function """This is just a simple design that can be used for a number of things.  Most commonly the commercial equivalent of this is used to blow air or liquid over tools on CNC machines, drill presses, etc.  I am thinking of using it as an articulated arm to hold camera flashes off-camera and run wires through the center.  Anything is possible.\r
\r
Feel free to post up modifications, as this is tweaked to the fraction of a millimeter for my specific machine to be exactly as tight as I wanted them to be.  \r
\r
Note:  I break a few here and there when putting them together.  This is to be expected, and possibly thickening up the "neck" would fix this.  I print 3 x 2 using multiply so this isn't a huge deal to break one every now and then.\r
\r
EDIT:  I uploaded all three resolutions.  The highest is what made the links in the picture, but you may have similar luck with the other two resolutions.  Thanks!""" ;
