I cut it from a 2.6 mm marquetry table, Soon i get it in steel or aluminium.\r
\r
Edited 18th September:\r
\r
I have corrected an error in the measurement between the centers of Prusa's heatedbed, before it was 210 mm and 209 mm now. The dxf file has been replaced.\r
\r
I have also uploaded photos of the piece steel laser-cut 3 mm.""" ;
