function: "I\xC2\xB4m making a RepRap Prusa with Prusajr's heatedbed. The first thing i surprised me was that standar mendel base don\xC2\xB4t fit with Prusajr's heated bed. I had to make an intermediate suport for this. This is my first thing upload to Thingverse.\r\nI cut it from a 2.6 mm marquetry table, Soon i get it in steel or aluminium.\r\n\r\nEdited 18th September:\r\n\r\nI have corrected an error in the measurement between the centers of Prusa's heatedbed, before it was 210 mm and 209 mm now. The dxf file has been replaced.\r\n\r\nI have also uploaded photos of the piece steel laser-cut 3 mm."
