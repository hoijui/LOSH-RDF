    okh:function """The Prusajrâ€™s PCB heatedbed is a very interesting commercial piece for its simplicity and performance. The problem is that it doesn't fit perfectly with the design of the Y-Axis of Reprap.\r
\r
Due to heat, expansion, and fixation at the four corners, the platform could reach warp. To fix this I have set the platform under an 3 mm aluminum plate to provide rigidity and protection. The platform is placed upside down, where hotter. The protection of the upside PCB is replaced by the aluminum sheet.\r
\r
The group is supported by two vertical pieces that together with plastic bushings Igus slide on the Y-axis guides.\r
\r
These vertical supports are designed to be easy to assemble and disassemble the set of PCB heatedbed and aluminum plate, in order to unload parts or perform cleanup.\r
\r
The belt is fixed directly to supports pieces. It has also included a threaded hole with M3 for a screw to tighten the belt easily.\r

Redesing 6-Nov-2011\r
\r
I made â€‹â€‹some modifications to work better. Added two pieces of rod 8x145 to join the uprights, has increased the height of the uprights in 5 mm, and gaps were placed to hinder the transmission of heat.\r
\r
I've also uploaded some photos, some can see the changes that have made my Prusa, now called Prusa Air. You can see more in: http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Air""" ;
