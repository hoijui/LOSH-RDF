function: "ALREADY PUBLISHED THE NEW VERSION  AIR 2 AT http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14204\r\n\r\nSince I discovered the RepRap project I was surprised how much knowledge could be stored in an Internet community. I was impressed as a practical invention was able to born and grow in the network through the collaboration of specialists in various fields such as mechanics, electronics, computers ... all around the world.\r\n\r\nIn the mechanical field, It was a revolution when Josef Prusa got dramatically simplify the construction of a RepRap Mendel, current resulting Prusa, that has become a standard in building a RepRap. This also achieved make it much easier a person to be able to build a 3D printer.\r\n\r\nThe Prusa Air drinks from this spirit and tries to give a twist to the construction of a 3D printer. Its design is based on three basic principles:\r\n\r\n1) To simplify the manufacturing and assembly (KISS principle).\r\n2) Designing parts the cheapest way to be able to meet the requirements.\r\n3) A little beauty.\r\n\r\nWith these guidelines, the use of RP parts is reduced for \"commercial\" pieces but always bearing in mind that they were readily available worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe changes are basically:\r\n\r\nA) Most of the frame rods and RP pieces has been replaced by three pieces of acrylic embedded between them. They have followed all the design dimensions of Prusa, so for size, trips, electronics, firmwares... it works as a Prusa.\r\n  \r\nB) One of the sides of the typical Mendel triangle has been removed, resulting in a work area more accessible.\r\n\r\nC) The holes for the rods have been changed so that the rods can be removed without having to completely unscrew the nuts.\r\n\r\nD) The X and Z axis haven\xE2\u20AC\u2122t changed, they are exactly the same of a Mendel Prusa, the Y axis, as the guides are placed in the same way, you can choose to place a traditional Y-axis or mount a Y-axis with integrated heated platform like this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11657.\r\n\r\nAll the infographics was made by Pikelo with Cinema 4D + Vray.\r\n\r\nThere is a wiki page writen in Spanish:  http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Aire"
