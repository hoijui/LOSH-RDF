function = "This is my first \"Thing\".\r\n\r\nThis is a fan holder to mount a 40mm Fan to cool the Sanguinololu electronics on a Longboat Prusa Mendel. \r\n\r\nThe Longboat kit has a 5mm thick ABS board on which the Sanguinololu electronics are mounted. This holder is designed to slip on to the edge of that board and provide an airflow over the Power Transistors and the Pololus Stepper Motor drivers."
