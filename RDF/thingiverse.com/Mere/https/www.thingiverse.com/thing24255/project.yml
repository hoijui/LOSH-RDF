function: "I modelled this cat in Maya, based on my own cat.\r\nIt is designed to be easily printable, even with 0% fill and no external support.\r\n\r\nFor more info on modelling for 3d printing in Maya, please check out my site: http://zoltanb.co.uk/tips-and-tricks-on-preparing-complex-models-for-3d-printing/\r\n\r\nGive it a go, it only takes ~12 minutes to print this kitty! (on an Ultimaker)\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, \r\nall comments/criticism welcome...\r\nas long as you don't call my cat fat! :)\r\n\r\nNew!\r\nlucycat-large.stl added for printing bigger, shinier and cuter cats!\r\nHigher res, also the tail has been modified for better printing."
