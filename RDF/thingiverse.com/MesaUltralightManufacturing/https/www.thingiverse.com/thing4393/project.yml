function: I got so excited about the first print from my new MakerBot (a 20 mm cube) that I decided I wanted to make a stand for it. After some experimentation with the OpenSCAD and ReplicatorG software, I came up with this. It was the second thing I printed out on the MakerBot, and it looks pretty decent. I\'m going to print out a Glow-in-the-dark cube to stick in it when my new plastic arrives.
