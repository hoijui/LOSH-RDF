    okh:function """This is my second DIY 3 axis cnc machine. It is designed in solidworks 2008 (~50-60 hours) and built mostly out of MDF. Provided are all the source files and drawings in both Solidworks and edrawing formats. This machine is possible to make with just some hand & power tools, but I used my first cnc machine to make most of the smaller parts.  



The machine uses chinese linear rails and ballscrews from ebay seller linearmotionbearings2008. With the 1.8Nm stepper motors I use with geckodrive g540 it achieves up to 5m/min rapids and 3m/min feedrates. The working area is about 110cm x 60cm x 10cm.  



Expected cost to build a machine like this from scratch is 1000-1300 euros. It also took me over 80 hours to construct.""" ;
