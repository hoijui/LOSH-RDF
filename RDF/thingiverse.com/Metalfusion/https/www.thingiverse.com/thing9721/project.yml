function: "Machine upgraded to version 2.1! These parts will greatly increase the Z-axis rigidity, especially when drilling and cutting aluminium. All of them can be cut with the machine itself ( some hand finishing such as making the threads is required though )\r\n\r\nZ-axis nut holder and top plate supports make the biggest difference, others are not as crucial.\r\n\r\nThe zip-package contains updated solidworks files including all assemblies and drawings. Aluminium part outlines are provided as dxf and an overview of them with some measurements as pdf."
