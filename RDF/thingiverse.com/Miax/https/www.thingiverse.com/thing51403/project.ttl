    okh:function """This is my Xdroid's Medium-Duty Robotic Gripper, designed for applications where gripping/holding/lifting something is needed. I designed them to support both Standard-Size servo's as well as the HiTec Waterproof servos (slightly larger than standard size).   
   
This gripper is designed with touch-sensitivity in-mind, with a specially-designed hand/paddle model combo that allows you to pancake an Adafruit Industries 1.5" x 1.5" Force Sensitive Resistor inside safely ; http://www.adafruit.com/products/1075 ; The paddle design ensures that the force is sensed regardless of where the paddles grip an object. :)  
   
This model requires two Standard size servos, I have not completed the version in which both paddles are controlled by one servo, and a standard-size servo at regular torque might have problems just actuating the gripper as it is.   
   
I recommend a high-torque metal gear servo for this! Servo City sells a Great waterproof servo (http://www.servocity.com/html/hs-5646wp_servo.html) and I have a servo-plate that fits them included. Or any standard-size servo, like the one's Adafruit sells: http://www.adafruit.com/products/1142  
   
The models in this thing are oriented in the direction that I recommend you print them - with the proper face-down. To make a complete Medium-Duty Gripper, you will need to print some models multiple times while other models you will only need to print once. The instructions will detail this out.   
   
I am modelling a more sophisticated version that will be able to grip much larger and heavier objects! Stay Tuned. :)""" ;
