function: "This is my Xdroid's Medium-Duty Robotic Gripper, designed for applications where gripping/holding/lifting something is needed. I designed them to support both Standard-Size servo's as well as the HiTec Waterproof servos (slightly larger than standard size).   \n   \nThis gripper is designed with touch-sensitivity in-mind, with a specially-designed hand/paddle model combo that allows you to pancake an Adafruit Industries 1.5\" x 1.5\" Force Sensitive Resistor inside safely ; http://www.adafruit.com/products/1075 ; The paddle design ensures that the force is sensed regardless of where the paddles grip an object. :)  \n   \nThis model requires two Standard size servos, I have not completed the version in which both paddles are controlled by one servo, and a standard-size servo at regular torque might have problems just actuating the gripper as it is.   \n   \nI recommend a high-torque metal gear servo for this! Servo City sells a Great waterproof servo (http://www.servocity.com/html/hs-5646wp_servo.html) and I have a servo-plate that fits them included. Or any standard-size servo, like the one's Adafruit sells: http://www.adafruit.com/products/1142  \n   \nThe models in this thing are oriented in the direction that I recommend you print them - with the proper face-down. To make a complete Medium-Duty Gripper, you will need to print some models multiple times while other models you will only need to print once. The instructions will detail this out.   \n   \nI am modelling a more sophisticated version that will be able to grip much larger and heavier objects! Stay Tuned. :)"
