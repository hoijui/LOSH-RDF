function = "As I began to model in Blender more and more to create models specifically for 3D printing on my MakerBot Replicator, I continually ran into issues of not getting the models Exactly the right size. I finally broke down and created a set of imperial-unit rulers that I use more in Blender than as a 3D object. \r\n \r\nThe point of the rulers is that they make modelling in Blender easier when your trying to get something to an exact size. I included some pics from Blender of me using the rulers while measuring a cog-gear I recently made, and I have found that I make at least 50% fewer sizing mistakes when using the rules in Blender round my models as I build them. \r\n \r\nPrinting them allows you to judge the real-life printed thing versus a real copy of the ruler to see how things line-up. My hope is that these can help others learning Blender on how to get things to the right size as they have become invaluable to me!"
