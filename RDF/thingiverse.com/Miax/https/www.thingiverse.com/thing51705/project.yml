function: "One of the things I needed to build for my Xdroid project was an armor coating for the Linear Actuators so that they can operate safely outdoors and in all-weather conditions. I know of a few friends that also use actuators in outdoor projects, and figured it might be useful for them and anyone who needs to protect a linear actuator from abuse. \r\n \r\nThe actuators I got were from ServoCity: http://www.servocity.com/html/12v_linear_actuators.html (The Heavy-Duty Variety). The selection of 3 strengths/speeds made it ideal for my project. These models could be adapted easily to other size actuators, I made all of the models by-hand in Blender, and  I like to keep pixels/vertices to a minimum. All six models are ready to print, I used my MakerBot Replicator 1-Dual for mine. \r\n\r\nI plan to make improvements to this design in the future as more needs arise. If you have any questions or comments, all feedback is most welcome! :)\r\n \r\nCheers, \r\n \r\nKris"
