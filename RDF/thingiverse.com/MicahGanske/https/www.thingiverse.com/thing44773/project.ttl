    okh:function """I got tired of waiting for Google to release their dock for the Nexus 4 so I made my own in Blender.  It doesn't have cool wireless charging, but you don't have to F5 the Play store page into oblivion to order one so that's a plus!  \r
\r
There are two versions of the dock, one scaled for a naked N4 and one for an N4 with official bumper.  I have a bumper (lucky me, I know), so I've only printed one for the bumper but the naked dock should work too.  \r
\r
Oh, and I have to give credit to Charles Perez on GrabCad for making a beautiful model of the Nexus 4 which I used for construction.  http://grabcad.com/library/nexus-4""" ;
