\r
I ever wantet a mount for the gopro on copters, without the huge and heavy original case.\r
\r
The version from TechShopJim is great, but for my use, I liked to have some more hold on the gopro.\r
So, what I did is, just cloned the the clip on the other side and printed with max infill.\r
\r
Works perfect and survived a lot of impact so far, but will do another one, that prevents the gopro getting scratched by the mount.""" ;
