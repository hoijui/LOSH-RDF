function: "This is a derivate of \"GoPro Hero 2 Camera Naked Mounting Clip\".\r\n\r\nI ever wantet a mount for the gopro on copters, without the huge and heavy original case.\r\n\r\nThe version from TechShopJim is great, but for my use, I liked to have some more hold on the gopro.\r\nSo, what I did is, just cloned the the clip on the other side and printed with max infill.\r\n\r\nWorks perfect and survived a lot of impact so far, but will do another one, that prevents the gopro getting scratched by the mount."
