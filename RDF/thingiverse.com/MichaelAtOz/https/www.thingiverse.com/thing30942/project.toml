function = "Plastic connectors for Aluminium* square tube. Or printable square tube.\r\n\r\nSimilar to those used to assemble furniture from the homeware store. Qubelok being one type http://www.fairlite.com.au/qubelok.html\r\n\r\nThere is a zip of the STLs down the bottom of the list.\r\n\r\nOne-inch or 25.4mm profile as writen, but you can change size via OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nThe SCAD has callable modules to model the connectors and the tube profile and a print module to split a part in half and rotate for 3D printing.\r\n\r\nWork in progress, probably needs refining.\r\n\r\nI'm also working on a hollow version so cables etc can pass through the joins. But no promises.\r\n\r\n* aluminum if you don't speak true English ;^}"
