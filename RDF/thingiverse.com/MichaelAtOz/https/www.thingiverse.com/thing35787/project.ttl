    okh:function """UPDATE Feb 2013: Well it doesn't print well with my 0.5mm nozzle. The wall where the hole is close to the side is too thin, see photos. I may try it scalled to a larger bolt size and play with slic3r settings a bit.\r
\r
This is not a direct derivative of makerslide http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8992 as it does not include the spacers.\r
\r
This is based on the spec at http://www.buildlog.net/sm_laser/drawings/b18001_rev_3.pdf\r
\r
I couldn't see why a metal one would be any better than a printed one. So I made one in SCAD.\r
\r
I've also included a plain spacer to match.\r
\r
It's also all zipped up for easy download.\r
\r
The original STL of the Eccentric Spacer is at http://www.makerslide.com/\r
\r
It and my version is for 0.281" 9/32" 7.1mm hole with a M5 bolt.\r
\r
However you can modify easily for other sizes.""" ;
