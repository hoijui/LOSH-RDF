function: "After hearing the news reports today of the NRAs stance I needed to go into print.  \n\nI had some Thing at hand so massaged it a bit, and Hey Presto, a ***Quick & Dirty Protest Badge***.  \n\nSo now the NRA can print themselves a ````badge of honour```` to wear.  \n\nGun fights at the School Corral...  \n\nmutter mutter mutter  \n\nAll the bad guy is going to do is take out the armed School Guard as sniper practice... (...so then I suppose the NRA will want guards with Assault rifles prone on all four corners, why not pill-boxes...Predators circling with hellfire...)  \n\n\"Thinking is man's only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful suspension of one's consciousness, the refusal to think; not blindness, but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict 'It is evil'.\"  \nAyn Rand   \n(though I am using this as a point to reflect on the acts of the directors of the NRA, refusing to see A is A)  \n\nAs whats-his-name said, something has to change.  \n\n(Yes I know there aren't that many eight pointed Sheriffs badges, that just makes this one better!)  \n\nBadge available via Customizer at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:54505"
