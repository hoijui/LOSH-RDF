function = "This was my first vector project for my digital fabrication class.  I chose a simple design - a star - to vector cut so I could familiarize myself with the way the machine works.  I also put a simple quote on the star so that I could use raster cutting as well.  The svg file that is shown on this page is not the way it looked in Illustrator when I designed it -- they must not have the font family that I used available."
