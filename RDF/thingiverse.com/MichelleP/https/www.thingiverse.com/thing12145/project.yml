function: 'For this project I had to make a 3D object out of acrylic using the epilog engraver.  This ring is made of six seperate parts: four fork-shaped ring parts, one long ring part and an ''m'' that snaps into the ring once it is glued together.  The ''m'' should be printed seperately from the other ring parts if you want it to be a different color.  I chose blue for the ''m'' and clear for the actual ring.  The dimensioning for this project was a little more complicated than the others but its worth it in the end because it''s by far the best thing I''ve made yet!'
