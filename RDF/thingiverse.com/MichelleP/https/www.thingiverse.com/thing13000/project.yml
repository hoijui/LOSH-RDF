function: The directions for this project were to make a replica of ourselves using the laser cutter and eggbot.  The body was to be made out of acrylic while the head had to be a creation from the eggbot.  Being familiar with Illustrator, it was a quick process to make a dress, arm and feet design.  I even added an 'm', some hands and the hem of the dress to be raster cut.  To make the sketch that would go on the head of my person, I used Illustrator and then transferred it into the program Inkscape which already had an eggbot template created.  After printing them out on the respective machines, I glued them together and had my very own mini-me.
