function = "For this project I made a 3D object using the makerbot.  I decided to make a pet dinosaur, named mr dinosaur, for my mini-me so she wouldn't be lonely.  I used Inventor to make the design of both the dinosaur body and the dinosaur's spikes.  I then transfered the body to the makerbot to print in 3D while I sent the sopikes to the laser cutter to be vetered out of neon acrylic.  After a couple issues with sizing and multiple printings (I had to play aaround so the spikes fit the body) Mr. Dinosaur is complete."
