function = "Originally, I was going to make a wooden pendant and attach it to a necklace.  However, it was too large the first time I printed it.  Instead of re-printing it, I realized it would make a great ornament.  Therefore, I added an extra hole right at the center and looped a piece of reed ribbon through it.  I printed out a few more and gave them to my aunt and mom for the holidays!"
