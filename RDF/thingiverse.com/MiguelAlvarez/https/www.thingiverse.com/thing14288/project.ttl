    okh:function """This is my first Thingiverse upload! I decided to make this since it only includes a bag (pfft I dont care about dust when it could snap in my backpack!!)\r
I have yet to create it my self as my makerbot thing-o-matic still hasn't arrived :(\r
I printed a 1:1 ratio diagram of the headphone slot to make sure that the headphones would fit.\r
Im not sure if the clip will snap off since I haven't been able to experiment with the plastics flexibility yet ( still haven't made my first print!)\r
The case and cover are too big to print as a whole on a makerbot, and I wont be making them into split parts until my makerbot arrives.\r
I decided to upload the files either way for now in case anybody wants to use them with a bigger printer, or split the parts themselves and super glue them. \r
These parts were made on Autodesk Inventor. If anybody would like me to upload those files as well to modify them just let me know.\r
\r
I have yet to print this myself so it will still be a work in progress!! But if anybody else prints it to try it out, I'd love feedback!\r
\r
Oh and I also added the makerbot logo on the front :)\r
\r
Update: \r
I'm uploading the split case and cover parts. The names are Cover_1, Cover_2, etc... If your going to build this on a printer that doesnt have a big enough build area for the whole pare, dont use the Cover.stl, use the ones I just described instead. \r
The cover and the case have been split into 9 parts each.""" ;
