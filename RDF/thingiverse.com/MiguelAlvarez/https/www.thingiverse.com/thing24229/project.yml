function: "2 Hangers to easily hang and dismount your RC plane on your wall.  \n\n\nI just learned how to use OpenSCAD to make this part customizeable! This is my first OpenSCAD/customizer part so let me know if I'm missing something or if the parameters arent creating the file properly. I'd love feedback!  \n\nBy default the part is made to be used with my parkzone f4u corsair but it can be made to fit any plane wheels with the customizer!  \n\nDefault Total Wheel width (including axle parts)- 1.15 in  \n\nDefault Wheel Diameter (to fit within slot) - 1.90 in  \n\nAlso make sure the wheel style is the same for it to fit through the slot properly (Wheel is attached to a L shaped rod) thought I think its probably the most common if not the only wheel type for RC planes in general (I only own one so idk lol).  Look at pictures for reference."
