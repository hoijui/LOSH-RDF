function: "These thumb wheels are to make HBP adjustments easy when using upgrades such as \r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6558\r\n\r\nI found some thumb wheel designs around thingiverse but the reason I decided to make my own was because they were all for hex nuts. When I bought the aluminum HBP kit, it came with square nuts which dont work for these designs.\r\nI made 2 files, one for hex nuts and another for square nuts."
