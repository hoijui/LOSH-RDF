function = "Crude and unrefined, but I expect I might save someone a few hours designing one from scratch.\r\n\r\nI needed a tripod mount for my Nexus S, preferably a very secure one (it's a long way to the hard floor below) so most of the other similar prints available on Thingiverse were unsuitable. It might fit other similar sized phones, but I don't have their dimensions to say for sure. Since it's held down by a screw, there is little to no chance of the phone falling out of it.\r\n\r\nThe quick release pad has been made to fit the dimensions of a Rekam DigiPod RT-M45 tripod, and I don't know if a standard exists for those."
