function = "This is a chess set that I designed to learn some new skills with sketchup.  The rounded bases of the pieces are weighted and sit on concave squares.  It makes for an interesting twist to the standard chess board.  Special thanks to PerryT for the idea for the board base.  This is a marathon of a print,  roughly 60 hours went into this project and I can tell you it was no easy task.  Make no mistake though, if you want to take your 3D printing to the next level or you are an avid chess fan this project is for you.  Finnish this print and you will be among the masters of the printing world, you exploits and heroism will be spoken of far and wide by hobbyists and professionals alike.  Good luck and God speed!  \r\n\r\n[Donate](https://www.paypal.me/MikeyBe)\r\n\r\nUpdate 3/18/13:  I have added a single Pawn .stl along with .stls for a full set of Rooks, Knights, Bishops, King and queen.  One includes the Knight that needs support and the other set is for the two piece Knight that needs to be glues together."
