Update 7/3/13: I've added the sketchup file for the motor mounts and the spacers.  \r

Update 5/12/13:  This project kinda fell to the back burner for a bit.  I have uploaded 8 new files for motor mounts.  There are two styles, round and teardrop.  There are also 4 different types depending on your needs.  Unfortunately there is just the 9/16th diameter at the moment.  Now that I have the designs finalized I will begin to add other common arm diameters.  Stay tuned.""" ;
