function: "This is a printable motor mount for a carbon fibre tube that can be used on my printed quad or any other multi rotor.  Choose from list of sizes.  All sizes are outer diameter of CF tube.   \r\n\r\n[Donate](https://www.paypal.me/MikeyBe)\r\n\r\nUpdate 7/3/13: I've added the sketchup file for the motor mounts and the spacers.  \r\n\r\nUpdate 5/12/13:  This project kinda fell to the back burner for a bit.  I have uploaded 8 new files for motor mounts.  There are two styles, round and teardrop.  There are also 4 different types depending on your needs.  Unfortunately there is just the 9/16th diameter at the moment.  Now that I have the designs finalized I will begin to add other common arm diameters.  Stay tuned."
