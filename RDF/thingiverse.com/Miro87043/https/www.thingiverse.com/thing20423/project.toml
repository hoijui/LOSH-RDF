function = "This is my printer. Derived/inspired by the Aluminum Mendel. I wanted to make a printer with extrusions that was larger than the normal 8 x 8 platform. I liked the Aluminum Mendel design very much but wanted to scale it and change a few things.\r\n\r\nHere is what I did:\r\n\r\nnearly 12\" X 12\" X 12\" build envelope\r\n10 mm smooth rod on X and Y axis with LM10UU's\r\nNEMA 23 for Y axis\r\nCarriage for Greg's hinged accessible extruder \r\nI disassembled an ATX PSU and mounted it with Gen 7 under the build platform\r\nI plan to redesign the x ends to accommodate springs in case of crash so I can remove the springs from under the build platform to reduce jitter. \r\nand many other parts I redesigned\r\n\r\nI have this up and running and will post more files soon."
