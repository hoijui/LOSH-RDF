    okh:function """This is my printer. Derived/inspired by the Aluminum Mendel. I wanted to make a printer with extrusions that was larger than the normal 8 x 8 platform. I liked the Aluminum Mendel design very much but wanted to scale it and change a few things.\r
\r
Here is what I did:\r
\r
nearly 12" X 12" X 12" build envelope\r
10 mm smooth rod on X and Y axis with LM10UU's\r
NEMA 23 for Y axis\r
Carriage for Greg's hinged accessible extruder \r
I disassembled an ATX PSU and mounted it with Gen 7 under the build platform\r
I plan to redesign the x ends to accommodate springs in case of crash so I can remove the springs from under the build platform to reduce jitter. \r
and many other parts I redesigned\r
\r
I have this up and running and will post more files soon.""" ;
