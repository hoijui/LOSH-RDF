    okh:function """I built the great Prusa Air 2 by Mecano and was thrilled with its performance. Especially the increased lateral stability added by the acrylic frame. However I like to use my dual fan mount x carriage and I lost over 25 mm of x travel. I also found it difficult to squeeze 100 mm of z travel out of it.\r
\r
I made a few simple changes to allow full use of a 200 x 200 mm build platform and increased z travel to 150 mm. I also slightly increased the size of cross brace at the bottom to ensure no rigidity was lost.\r
\r
Other subtle changes:\r
Changed the electronics holes to accommodate an Arduino Mega 2560 and Ramps 1.4. I also relocated the electronics up higher and depending on which side you put the pertaining panel the electronics can be mounted on the inside.\r
\r
I took scotty1024's advice and made a laser cut y motor mount. I doubled the acrylic so its solid and slotted the holes to allow for tensioning and easy removal.\r
\r
The slots are adjusted for acrylic that is 0.22" (5.6 mm) as that is what's available to me.\r
\r
Also included is a acrylic base plate for use with Prusa 2 linear bearing mounts and 4 spacers for mounting electronics.\r
 \r
Update: I added spars to the sides that make the frame rock solid. I used acrylic weld to secure them.""" ;
