function = "I wanted to run Jetty's accelerated firmware ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15380 ) but at the time it required the LCD* ( http://www.makerbot.com/docs/makerbot-gen4-interface-kit/ ). So I went to buy one from MakerBot, but it is discontinued.\r\n\r\nWell . . . why not hack** one up?\r\n\r\nAll the parts are less than $60.\r\n\r\nFair warning, I have an interest in Crystalfontz which is why I got the LCD there :) The rest of the parts have Digi-Key links in the BOM.\r\n\r\nThe case is printable on a CupCake or TOM, but the slicing I did is horrible. Hopefully someone will care enough to fix the slicing. What I have works, it just looks like a certain Mary Shelley lead character.\r\n\r\nYou will need:\r\n) the parts on the BOM\r\n) wire ( you can strip a USB cable like I did)\r\n) soldering iron & solder\r\n) heat shrink\r\n\r\n* No LCD version now available:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17855 )\r\n\r\n** I do mean HACK, this is the sloppiest SCAD + slice + print + glue + wiring ever! Blech!"
