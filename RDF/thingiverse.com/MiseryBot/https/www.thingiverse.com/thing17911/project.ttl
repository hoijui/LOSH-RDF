\r
Well . . . why not hack** one up?\r
\r
All the parts are less than $60.\r
\r
Fair warning, I have an interest in Crystalfontz which is why I got the LCD there :) The rest of the parts have Digi-Key links in the BOM.\r
\r
The case is printable on a CupCake or TOM, but the slicing I did is horrible. Hopefully someone will care enough to fix the slicing. What I have works, it just looks like a certain Mary Shelley lead character.\r
\r
You will need:\r
) the parts on the BOM\r
) wire ( you can strip a USB cable like I did)\r
) soldering iron & solder\r
) heat shrink\r
\r
* No LCD version now available:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17855 )\r

** I do mean HACK, this is the sloppiest SCAD + slice + print + glue + wiring ever! Blech!""" ;
