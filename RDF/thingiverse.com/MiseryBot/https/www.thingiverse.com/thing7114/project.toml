The older version is here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7091\r\n\r\nThis is a simple piece that forces the extruder to start and stop on short strips.\r\n\r\nIf the strips are clean and the exact same length as the control box, the start and stop calibration of the extruder is good!\r\n\r\nThis version has better control of the test stripe so you can tweak it to one pass of the head, and prints out multiple sets of bars, each at a different length.\r\n\r\nSlightly related to: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8859"
