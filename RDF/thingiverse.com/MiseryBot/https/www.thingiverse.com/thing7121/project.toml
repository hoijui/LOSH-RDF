function = "I installed some cheapo white LED undercounter lights. My wife complained that they made it look like a disco, since you could see the LEDs from the side. After a few months, they had already grown dim, so they went into the trash.\r\n\r\nThe goals of these lights are:\r\n\r\n1) low enough profile that they are hidden by the lip under the cabinet\r\n\r\n2) optical shield (the makerbotted part) to make the LEDs not look like a disco\r\n\r\n3) high quality LEDs that are run below spec to ensure a long life.\r\n\r\nAfter installing 4 of these lights under the cabinet above our breakfast bar, it has gone from a shadow spot to the bright place where I put things that I need to read."
