function: "Update 2011/03/28: Added the z-stage.\r\n\r\nWe took the DXF files from here\r\n\r\nhttp://svn.makerbot.com/trunk/cupcake/lasercut-parts/z-body/\r\n\r\non 2010 / 03 / 28, (Revision 1254) pushed them into SolidWorks, extruded the pieces 5mm, saved them as STL, imported them in to OpenSCAD, re-assembled them in OpenSCAD, and re-saved them.\r\n\r\nThis might be useful for using as OpenSCAD a modeling tool.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the newer version has an error in OpenSCAD and will not export an STL. If you know how to fix that, please message me and I'll put your fix up.\r\n\r\nThe older files from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:457 are also included, commented out."
