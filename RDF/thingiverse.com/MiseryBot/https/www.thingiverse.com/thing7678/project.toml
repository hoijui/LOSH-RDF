function = "This thing is an printable spider coupling designed for a rubber insert. It has robust clamping, and should be well balanced if tightened evenly.\r\n\r\nIf the rubber spider is cut cut correctly, there will be axial compression cushioning, angular cushioning, and rotary cushioning without slop.\r\n\r\nThis design must be kept in compression, it will not stay together under tension.\r\n\r\nVideo showing low-speed operation, with an exaggerated angle:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA71gIn71Zk\r\n\r\nVideo showing higher speed operation:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuOfSZBd0wA\r\n\r\n(Alternative experimental version here that uses silicone sealer: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7831 )\r\n\r\nHeritage:\r\n\r\nThis is an original work, but owes inspiration or is similar to these things:\r\n\r\nUniversal Joint by twotimes:\r\n * http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5078\r\n\r\nFlexible shaft coupling by twotimes:\r\n * http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5439\r\n\r\nPrusa Mendel PLA Coupling by Griffin_Nicoll\r\n * http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7153\r\n\r\nPrinted flexible beam coupling by jmgiacalone\r\n * http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7373\r\n\r\nSpider coupling - 5mm axis to M8 drivescrew by lievenstandaert:\r\n * http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6524\r\n\r\nHoeken's Coupling by hoeken:\r\n * http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5097"
