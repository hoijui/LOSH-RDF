This corrects some fiddly stuff I\r\n  found when I assembled the thing.  MiZ_Rider_0v1_No_STL.zip\r\n  has this latest OpenSCAD code but I have not had time to generate\r\n  the STL.\r\nMisery_Z_Rider_0v1_STL_ONLY.zip\r\n  has the 8 STL build plates, ready to print.\r\n\r\nMiZ is a complete Z-Stage replacement for the MakerBot Cupcake. Almost all the parts can be printed on your MakerBot. It will work with many extruders: MK5, MK6, MiseryPusher ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7129 shown) as well as any other extruder that is designed to attach to the standard MBI MK5 style extruder base plate (such as: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5684 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6713 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7113 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7037 ).\r\n\r\nThe goals were to have very few modifications to the MakerBot, and to have a rigid structure that would yield good quality prints (like: \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:8582 )\r\n\r\nWith my setup I can get 550mm/minute Z-travel rate:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-9MwgUz1v0\r\n\r\nHere is a longer and more boring video:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuudemoq2MQ\r\n\r\nAnd yet another showing stability during a high-vibration fill:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z8G90gfEYI\r\n\r\nExcluding nuts & bolts, re-used parts, and shipping the non-printed cost is as low as $26:\r\n * 2 of 12mm x 13 rods: $5 each\r\n * 8 of 623 bearings : $10/10 (shielded) or $20/10 (sealed)\r\n * ABS glue: $6\r\nLinks to the parts are in the instructions PDF.\r\n\r\nI do have some tweaks and improvements in mind. Please watch for updates.\r\n\r\nHeritage -- This design owes a lot of inspiration to these two things:\r\n\r\nZ-Rider by twotimes http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4740\r\n\r\nType A Z-Rider. v3.2 by TheRuttmeister http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5586\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n\r\nwhosawhatsis recommended his \"Minimalistic X-rod mount\":\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6884\r\ninstead of the version in the file. His is a nice design and should work well, it is lower profile and easier to open/close."
