New video showing awesome Z speed:\r

Thanks to Jetty's Accelerated Firmware: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15380\r
\r
* The original 0v0 zip did not have all the needed files in it.\r
  The current MiZ_Rider_0v0_fixed.zip corrects this.\r
\r
* There is now 0v1 uploaded. This corrects some fiddly stuff I\r
  found when I assembled the thing.  MiZ_Rider_0v1_No_STL.zip\r
  has this latest OpenSCAD code but I have not had time to generate\r
  the STL.\r
Misery_Z_Rider_0v1_STL_ONLY.zip\r
  has the 8 STL build plates, ready to print.\r
\r
MiZ is a complete Z-Stage replacement for the MakerBot Cupcake. Almost all the parts can be printed on your MakerBot. It will work with many extruders: MK5, MK6, MiseryPusher ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7129 shown) as well as any other extruder that is designed to attach to the standard MBI MK5 style extruder base plate (such as: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5684 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6713 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7113 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7037 ).\r
\r
The goals were to have very few modifications to the MakerBot, and to have a rigid structure that would yield good quality prints (like: \r
http://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:8582 )\r
\r
With my setup I can get 550mm/minute Z-travel rate:\r

Here is a longer and more boring video:\r

\r
And yet another showing stability during a high-vibration fill:\r

\r
Excluding nuts & bolts, re-used parts, and shipping the non-printed cost is as low as $26:\r
 * 2 of 12mm x 13 rods: $5 each\r
 * 8 of 623 bearings : $10/10 (shielded) or $20/10 (sealed)\r
 * ABS glue: $6\r
Links to the parts are in the instructions PDF.\r
\r
I do have some tweaks and improvements in mind. Please watch for updates.\r

Heritage -- This design owes a lot of inspiration to these two things:\r

Suggestions:\r
\r
whosawhatsis recommended his "Minimalistic X-rod mount":\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6884\r
instead of the version in the file. His is a nice design and should work well, it is lower profile and easier to open/close.""" ;
