function = "This is a slight modification to whosawhatsis' excellent Minimalistic X-rod mount. Thanks to whosawhatsis for including the OpenSCAD code.\r\n\r\nI made it 2mm thicker, and extended the body out around the nuts.\r\n\r\nI also removed the rep-rap style teardrop, because I could not see what that helped.\r\n\r\nAnd of course I made the resolution really high so the files would be huge and skeinforge slow."
