function: "(sorry, video link is now dead)THIS THING IS FAMOUS! Shows up at 1:54 on this episode of Robot Hospital: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shpt1hD4z7Y  \r\nBlogged here:\r\nhttp://www.makerbot.com/blog/2011/06/23/wall-thickness-calibration-test-piece-by-miserybot\r\n\r\nThis thing can be used to see what your skeinforge settings and bot will do for certain wall thicknesses:\r\n\r\n0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2\r\n\r\nThe OpenSCAD is included in case you want to try other thicknesses.\r\n\r\nThe image has the \"as designed\" thickness in green, the measured straight wall thickness \"as printed\" in red (for my bot, of course), and the measured cylinder thickness in purple.\r\n\r\nMy bot is set up with 0.25mm layer thickness and W/T of 2.0 for theoretical wall thickness or 0.5mm. For reference, I am using the MakerBot 0.4mm nozzle, but that really does not come into play.\r\n\r\nSlightly related to: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7114"
