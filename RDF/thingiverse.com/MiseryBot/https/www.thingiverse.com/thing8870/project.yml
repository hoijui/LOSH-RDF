function: "On this part: http://www.thingiverse.com/image:57507\r\n\r\nYou can see some damped oscillations after the logo. I made this thing to try to get a better look at them.\r\n\r\nThe photos were taken of a part built on MiseryBot which has a lowrider.\r\n\r\nPrinting was at 40mm/sec\r\n\r\nSomeone with mote math skilz than me might be able to draw some conclusion as to what the waves mean."
