function = "Just a few random bits of gcode to play music on the Ultimaker. Uploading them so that I can just link to it as opposed to trawling through my harddive for it each time I'm asked.\r\n\r\nConverted using https://github.com/TeamTeamUSA/mid2cnc\r\n\r\nWarning! This is for the Ultimaker only. Running the gcode on any other machine might risk a headcrash or something worse. If in doubt, get mid2cnc and convert the midi specifically for your machine."
