function: "I really liked wizard23\\'s Screwable Jewellery Box, and wanted to use it as a cup. But unfortunately, I couldn\\'t get AoI and MetaCAD working properly on my machine so I attempted to learn OpenSCAD and recreate it so that I could customise it to make cups.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I modified the scad file so that the object now fits in the radius specified (as opposed to creating the screw threads around said radius, thus ending up with a larger object). I have also added a shot glass sized cup."
