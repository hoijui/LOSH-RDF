function = "I needed a place to hang my headphones so I went and printed one.\r\n\r\nThis attaches to an Ikea Lack shelf (which is 50mm thick). The ABS will bend a little under the weight from the headphones. Or at least this one did (printed with 2 walls and 0.3 infill).\r\n\r\nVersion 4 has the bracket bend inwards slightly. This should reduce some of the sagging of the bracket under load."
