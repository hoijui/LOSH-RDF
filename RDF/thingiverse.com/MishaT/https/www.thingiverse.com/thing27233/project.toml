function = "Nautilus gears based on logarithmic spirals.\r\n\r\nGear profiles generated based on research by Ágnes Dabi, Zsigmond Istvan Varju, Dr. Laczik Balint et. al. at the Budapesti Muszaki es Gazdasagtudomanyi Egyetem.\r\n\r\nAgnes, Dabi (2005). Változó áttételű fogaskerék tervezés (Doctoral dissertation). \r\nBudapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem\r\n\r\nThe gear profiles were generated using this Maple script for which full credit goes to the original authors:\r\nhttp://www.maplesoft.com/applications/view.aspx?SID=95483&view=html&L=G\r\n\r\nRendered animation of the gears: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtkEyZwuwH4\r\n\r\nDon't own a 3D printer? Now available for purchase at Shapeways (http://shpws.me/Kdit) \r\n\r\nI'm not going to upload the SolidWorks file because it is frankly a mess of different experimentation, but I uploaded the DXF which should be easy enough to modify with most CAD software.\r\n\r\n Update: No more breaking pins! \r\n\r\nI've replaced the pins with a simple press fit design.  Print two of the Connector Bar v2 or the Curved Connector Bar v2 (same idea, just curved for aesthetics) and snap them together!  On a well calibrated printer they should snap together easily and hold tightly with friction.\r\n\r\nIf they aren't sticking together just add a drop of glue!  Warning, these bars are one time use, they will be very hard to pull apart without breaking the pin.\r\n\r\nI will keep the original bars on for reference."
