function: "A printable, wearable arc reactor based on the Mark I movie version.  \r\n\r\nThere are already some great arc reactors on here, but I wanted to take my own crack at it.  \r\n\r\n--------------  \r\nUpdate: I increased the clearance of the top ring, should be easier to assemble now.  Also added source files.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I uploaded the 9V battery holder you see in the pictures due to multiple requests, as a warning it is not an optimized part but a quick design to work with the switch I had on hand. I am sure there are better designs out there on Thingiverse if you look around."
