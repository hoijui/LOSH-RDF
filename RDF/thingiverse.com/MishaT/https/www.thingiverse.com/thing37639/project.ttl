Here is what I am currently using on the same slide:

-------------  

This is for anyone that converts to the PBC linear slide but wants to keep using the popular Jonas Kuehling's Greg's Wade extruder.  

Works only with the J-Head Mrk IV-B or another equally tall hot-end.  For shorter hot-ends the shelf on the mounting plate needs to be moved lower and the cold end made taller for the motor to clear the carriage. I have uploaded the SolidWorks file for easy modification.  There are too many hot ends out there to make a one size fits all solution since the shorter the hot-end the taller the extruder body has to be for the motor to clear the carriage.  This is more of a personal solution for my specific set of hardware as a stop-gap until I move to a micro extruder.  

For a fan mount to go with this carriage see:
