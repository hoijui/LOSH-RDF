\r
I have a problem with goop being melted onto the outside cone of the hot end, and with my new fan mount it is a pain to get at it manually to clean.  So I designed this little guy to automate the process.\r
\r
For this to work you need to have at least a 30mm gap between the edge of your heated bed and the side extrusion.  I am using a 1in diameter dremel wire cup bit but something slightly smaller or larger could work as well, depending on how big of a gap you have to work with.\r
\r
The mounting hole is sized for a M4 drop in t-nut, and there is a M3 set screw with nut trap.  The shank of the dremel bit is 1/8 in diameter.""" ;
