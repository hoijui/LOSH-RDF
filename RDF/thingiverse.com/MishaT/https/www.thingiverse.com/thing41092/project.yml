function: "Vertical X-axis belt tie down for PBC linear slide on MendelMax 1.5. This version does not require the use of cable ties or large screw down clamps and includes a built-in belt tensioner.\r\n\r\nGrooves in the mount are designed to tightly trap the standard GT2 2mm pitch 6mm wide timing belts used on the MendelMax.  The grooves are designed to be tight and you might have to push the belt in with a small flat screw driver.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want the SolidWorks file, just a fair warning it is not the neatest design I have ever created and is kind of a mess."
