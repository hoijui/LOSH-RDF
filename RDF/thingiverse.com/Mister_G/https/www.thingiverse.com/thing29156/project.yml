function: Never leave home without it. Attach this to your key chain to store a few pills to tackle that surprise headache or other ailment that may come along. Available in 2 sizes, each have a snap to close sliding lid, a stop to prevent the lid from falling off and a key ring hole. The larger one has a first aid symbol on both sides.  The original version without the snap feature is included.
