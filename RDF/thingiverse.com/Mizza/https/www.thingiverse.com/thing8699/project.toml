function = "My first attempt at making an open source tire lever! Super handy for changing popped tubes on a bicycle! Print two, then use the first to pry off the tire, then clip it to the spoke, then use the other to remove the rest of the tire.\r\n\r\nI have no bot - can somebody try printing this and seeing if it works? This is my first Thing and I'd appreciate any feedback - just trying to get more involved with the Thing community.\r\n\r\nTrying to clone: http://bloombikeshop.com/productreviews/pedros-tire-levers.php\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad.
