function: "Follow me & my projects: twitter.com/MoceriMike\r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI participated in an event in Chicago called Improbable Objects at the What It Is gallery. At the opening night on March 29th, I scanned and printed many of the people attending the event. I used a Kinect  for scanning and Reconstructme for model construction. After I scanned the subject, I used Nettfab, Meshmixer, Meshlab, and RepG to clean the model in about 10 minutes. Then I put the .s3g of the model on an SD and printed their model out. While the model was being printed I was scanning/patching the next subject/model."
