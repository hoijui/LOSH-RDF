With me was Chicago based artist Patrick Lichty. \r\n\r\nOur setup comprised of Patrick's and my Thing-o-Matic, two Kinects for scanning, a TV connected to my computer so people could see the modeling process, and an assortment of promo swag.\r\n\r\nI scanned attendees and printed them out. They were able to take their models home with them as part of the experience. The process I used and sources are outlined in on our event card (click the second image)."
