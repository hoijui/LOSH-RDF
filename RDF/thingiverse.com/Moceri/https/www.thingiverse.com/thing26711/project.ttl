I spent my 4th of July (2012) vacation at my family's cabin in Northern Michigan and decided I needed to capture/scan pieces from my childhood. This scan is of a tribal African mask that hangs on the wall of a bedroom in the cabin. When I was a kid, I was always afraid to enter the room because I thought this mask was going to come alive and eat my soulâ€¦ One time my older brother Francesco chased me around the cabin with the mask, providing me with a fresh batch of nightmares.  Come to find out years later that the mask was harmless, I began to warm up to the mask. Now I really love this mask and thought it would be nice to replicate it and hang it on my wall at home.""" ;
