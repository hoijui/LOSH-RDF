Includes 212 individual PEOPLE and all the source files for your learning pleasure. \r\n\r\nI present to you citizens of Thingiverse, PEOPLE! 212 individuals to be exact! This thing represents a vast majority of all the people I have 3D scanned. The scanning software I use is called Reconstructme which uses an XBox 360 Kinect as the scanner. Every person I scanned was 3D printed on site in a matter of minutes using my MakerBot Thing-O-Matic or Replicator.\r\n\r\nHow was I able to obtain so many scans of PEOPLE?\r\nThroughout the year I have been invited by various galleries, exhibitions and institutions to show off MakerBots and demo/display my scanning work. Scanning and printing PEOPLE gives them an intimate look into 3D printing and provides a basis for their understanding of all the possibilities.  \r\n_________________________________________________\r\nFeatured Events:\r\nChicago Ideas Week @ Oriental Theater, Chicago \r\nEXPO Chicago 2012 @ Navy Pier, Chicago\r\nFacemask exhibition @ Zhou B Art Center, Chicago\r\nImprobable Objects exhibition @ What It Is gallery, Chicago\r\nMaker Faire Detroit @ Henry Ford Museum, Detroit"
