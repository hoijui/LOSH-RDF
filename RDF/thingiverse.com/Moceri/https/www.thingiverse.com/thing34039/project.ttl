\r
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the largest upload in Thingiverse history!\r
882 files @ 10.4 GB uncompressed! Includes 212 individual PEOPLE and all the source files for your learning pleasure. \r
\r
I present to you citizens of Thingiverse, PEOPLE! 212 individuals to be exact! This thing represents a vast majority of all the people I have 3D scanned. The scanning software I use is called Reconstructme which uses an XBox 360 Kinect as the scanner. Every person I scanned was 3D printed on site in a matter of minutes using my MakerBot Thing-O-Matic or Replicator.\r
\r
How was I able to obtain so many scans of PEOPLE?\r
Throughout the year I have been invited by various galleries, exhibitions and institutions to show off MakerBots and demo/display my scanning work. Scanning and printing PEOPLE gives them an intimate look into 3D printing and provides a basis for their understanding of all the possibilities.  \r
