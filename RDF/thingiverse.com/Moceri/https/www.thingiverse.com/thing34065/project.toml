There, I demoed my MakerBot Replicator in the lobby of the Oriental Theater with fellow Chicago mate Tom Burtonwood, while Bre gave his speech in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Before Bre went on stage, I gave him my signature \"scan/print supreme deluxe\".  FINALLY! This is definitely the Charizard to my collection of PEOPLE!"
