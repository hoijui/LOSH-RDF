function = "This is a 100% printable filament spool based heavily upon randyy's design. \r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\nAdded webbing to arms for strength.\r\nModified dovetails for better fit (the original required a lot of sanding to get to fit well - for me).\r\nIncreased arm thickness for strength.\r\nIncreased mount size for strength and more solid connection to MakerBot.\r\nChanged geometry of birdmouth slightly.\r\nIncreased size of filament holder so that more filament could be wound on spool.\r\nAdded hole in the filament holder.\r\nBeefed up the filament clip on the filament holder.\r\nEnlarged the conical pieces that press fit into the arm for more secure fit.\r\nAdded a filament guide for use with Cupcakes."
