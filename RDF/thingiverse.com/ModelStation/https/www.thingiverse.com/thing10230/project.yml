function: "This is a Space Shuttle model created from a 3D model downloaded from Google's 3D warehouse. The 3D model was split into separate parts, holes were added for pinning together with 3mm filament, and mounts were made for attaching the booster to the fuel tank, and the Orbiter to the fuel tank.\r\n\r\nFor a higher quality model see the larger Space Shuttle on Launch Pad thing.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10228"
