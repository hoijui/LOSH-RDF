function = "I needed a spool to keep some paracord I was using for a project untangled. Like always, the wire spools (which were so plentiful before I started the project) disappeared. so, I drew up an end piece to glue onto a piece of 1/2\" pvc. print out 2 of the spool ends and glue to pvc. A 3\" long piece of pvc (as shown in the picture) with the ends glued on will hold ~100ft of 550 Paracord.\r\nMisc information for printing: the spool end is 4\" in dia.\r\n\r\nI have included the Inventor part file in case anyone wants to mess around with it."
