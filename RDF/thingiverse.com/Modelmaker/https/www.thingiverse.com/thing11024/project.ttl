Like always, the wire spools (which were so plentiful before I started the project) disappeared. so, I drew up an end piece to glue onto a piece of 1/2" pvc. print out 2 of the spool ends and glue to pvc. A 3" long piece of pvc (as shown in the picture) with the ends glued on will hold ~100ft of 550 Paracord.\r
Misc information for printing: the spool end is 4" in dia.\r
\r
I have included the Inventor part file in case anyone wants to mess around with it.""" ;
