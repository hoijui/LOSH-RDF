function = "Inspired by Michael521's great hidden-electronics conversion kit idea (thing 18044), I set out to to the same thing on the slightly oversized Mendelmax variant that I am building.  These y-rod holders are made for 8mm y rods.  They include a hole for small screw and a slot for a trapped nut that together, act as a clamp although in practice, clamping doesn't seem necessary.  The outside facing part of the holder has a channel allowing the use of a screw and washer to tighten it to a trapped nut in the T-slot.\r\n\r\nThe main reason that I went this way was because I hope to mount my bed directly to igus pillow bushings, reducing bed weight & height and hopefully resulting in no need for bed-leveling.  Another benefit is that now the rods clear the hidden PSU.  If I need a little leveling, I figure that these individually adjustable holders will do the trick.\r\n\r\nA quick note:  This is still an experiment but I think it should work."
