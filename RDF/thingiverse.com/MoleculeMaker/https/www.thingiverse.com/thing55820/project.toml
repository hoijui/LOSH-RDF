function = "This is my third attempt to construct a 3-dimensional model of the molecule riboflavin. The model was constructed from a protein data bank file, was manipulated in the program VMD, and was then further manipulated in tinkercad (I really like this program). This is my third attempt at this molecule. I am still having an issue with gaps in the bonds between hydrogen atoms and their corresponding atoms, but. just with these bonds. I fixed these by manually replacing these with cylinders in tinkercad. The current print turned out perfect. I also broke out the model paints and painted the final version. Pictures are now included."
