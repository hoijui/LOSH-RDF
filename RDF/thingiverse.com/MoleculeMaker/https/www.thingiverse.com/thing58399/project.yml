function: "This is my second attempt to print out a protein structure based on a pdb file. This printed well, and is now a completed model. I am planning to paint it soon, and will post more later.  \nThis protein is a simple protein with a series of 7 amino acid repeat motifs, highlighted by a histidine residue. The crystal structure revealed that these histidines form a 4 alpha helical bundle, and the histidines seem to form a zipper pattern. I built the model with these histidine residues displayed. This is a natural protein, found in the organism Nitrosomonas europaea, which is commonly found in wastewater treatment plants."
