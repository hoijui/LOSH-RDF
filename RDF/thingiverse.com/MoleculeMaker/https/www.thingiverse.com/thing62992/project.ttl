 This printed well, and is now a completed model. I have painted it and provided some pictures.  



This protein is the human version, and is important for the transfer of electrons in the electron transport chain. It has a single heme heteroatom, which I have represented as CPK, along with the histidine ligand. I was a little bit upset by how flimsy it was following the initial print, but actually have grown to like it very much, as it gives one the sense of the fluidity of the protein backbone and structure. It is not as sturdy as some of my other models, but turned out very nice.""" ;
