function = "This is a model of the structure of the electron transport protein plastocyanin. The model is based on the crystal structure and the PDB file 2CJ3.  \n\n   \n\nThis printed well, and is now a completed model. I have painted it and provided some pictures.  \n\n   \n\nThis protein is found in the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis, and is an important component of the electron transport chain. It has a single copper heteroatom, which I have represented as CPK, along with the two histidine and single cysteine ligands.I tried to print this initially as a smaller protein without supports, but it was too flimsy and broke, so I put in some supports and made a larger model, which printed very well. It is quite sturdy. I painted the atoms in standard colors, with the copper painted magenta and the alpha helices in orange and the beta sheets in teal."
