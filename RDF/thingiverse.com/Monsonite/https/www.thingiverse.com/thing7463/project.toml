function = "Nanode provides lowest cost web interconnectivity for microcontrollers and smart sensor networks.\r\n\r\nIt is compatible with the Arduino programming environment. \r\n\r\nIt combines ATmega328, ENC28J60 ethernet controller and magjack ethernet connector on the same small pcb. All components are conventional through-hole so that it can be assembled by anyone with basic soldering skills.  It can be built for under Â£20 (US$32) which is half the cost of an Arduino with ethernet shield.\r\n\r\nThe Nanode has additional I/O connectors which bring all of the I/O from the ATmega328 microcontroller and power to the top edge of the pcb. This allows it to be plugged direrectly into a standard breadboard making prototyping easier. \r\n\r\nIt is compatible with most Arduino shields -such as the Nokia 3310 display shield shown'  \r\n\r\nIn addition to ethernet connectivity, Nanodes can be connected together on a low cost wired serial bus which allows them to be distributed around the home, for example, in a home automation or energy monitoring system. The serial bus allows Nanodes to communicate with one another or via a Master/Slave heirarchy. The Master device normally has the ethernet connection, and may also have real time clock, User display/interface SDcard storage etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nanode platform is an ideal project to introduce web connectivity and networking.  It's low cost and ease of assembly makes it an ideal college or Hackspace project.\r\n\r\nNanode allows applications for internet remote montoring and control to be developed on a familiar low cost platform Applications such as web servers, web clients or for data exchange and control using services such as Pachube.\r\n\r\nNanode is based on an earlier ATmega/ENC28J60 design and firmware by Tuxgraphics."
