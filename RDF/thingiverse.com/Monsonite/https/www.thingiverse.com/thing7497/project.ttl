    okh:function """Nanode - A Network Application Node.\r
\r
Nanode is like an Arduino but with ethernet/web connectivity.\r
\r
It also supports easy to use wireless and wired networks.  \r
\r
It has been developed as a low cost tool to allow simple sensor networks to be developed. \r
\r
It's the perfect platform for smart sensors, home automation, monitoring and control.\r
\r
It's through hole construction and the use of socketed DIP ICs makes it easy to build for the home constructor.\r
\r
It's been competetively priced so that it costs about the same as an Arduino (roughly $30 US, or Â£18).\r
\r
Without the ethernet parts it's sub $20 and can be used as a low cost Arduino "work-alike". It's compatible with most Arduino shields.\r
\r
It has some key advantages over the basic Arduino:\r
\r
1. Built in ethernet controller\r
2. Unique MAC address ID\r
3. Supports external EEPROM/FRAM/SRAM/Flash device for increased data storage\r
4. Supports a simple wireless transceiver shield from Jee Labs.\r
5. Supports a local multi-drop serial bus for wired networks of Master/Slaves\r
6. Breadboard friendly I/O connectors bring all I/O out on a 0.1" pitch\r
\r
\r
\r
\r
This is the productionised version of the Nanode for the London Hackspace. \r
\r
It's very much updated and includes a whole lot of new features.\r
\r
1.  SPI serial memory either SRAM, FRAM or EE for storing data and web pages,\r
\r
2. Microchip MAC chip so that it has a unique MAC address.\r
\r
3. Wireless Connectivity - plug a Jee Labs RFM12B module straight in to give a bi-directional wireless link.\r
\r
4.Moves the reset switch to where you can get at it - side actuated\r
\r
5. Moves the LED to where you can see it.\r
\r
6.Improved connector for local power/comms bus with 4 pin screw terminal block. Makes for simple interconnection with 4 way telephone cable.\r
\r
7. Adds the London Hackspace Logo, Pachube Logo and Arbour Wood Ltd details.\r
\r
8. Adds Auto-reset (from FTDI cable).\r
\r
9. Adds Virtual USB Vusb (Like Metaboard) for programming http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html\r
