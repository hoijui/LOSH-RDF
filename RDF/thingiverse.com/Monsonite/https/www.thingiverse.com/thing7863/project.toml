function = "This was an early design from August 2010, which builds a $20 web server on a breadboard.  It was done to prove that it could be done - and got working - which it does!\r\n\r\nIt uses ATmega328, ENC28J60 ethernet controller and a 74HC125 as glue logic. A Magjack and FTDI serial/USB cable completes the design. This combination was chosen for low cost, Arduino copatability and that all devices are available in conventional DIL packages.\r\n\r\nA schematic and board layout are included as a reference - but are still work in progress and not considered final - more of a starting point.  \r\n\r\nSince drawing the schematic I have subsequently moved to a different make of Magjack - which is not pin-compatible - please check your Magjack connections carefully.\r\n\r\nThe Magjack came on a breakout-board available from Cool Components in the UK and SparkFun in the 'States.  Everything else is fairly standard, I didn't bother with 49.9 ohm resistors, 51ohm 1% work perfectly well.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 spare buffers available on the 74HC125.  I've used these to make a wired serial network - see my blog \r\n\r\nhttp://sustburbia.blogspot.com/2010/08/arduino-compatible-web-server.html\r\n\r\nThis design is the forerunner of \"Nanode\" which also features on Thingiverse."
