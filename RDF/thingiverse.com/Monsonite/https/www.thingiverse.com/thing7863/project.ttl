    okh:function """This was an early design from August 2010, which builds a $20 web server on a breadboard.  It was done to prove that it could be done - and got working - which it does!\r
\r
It uses ATmega328, ENC28J60 ethernet controller and a 74HC125 as glue logic. A Magjack and FTDI serial/USB cable completes the design. This combination was chosen for low cost, Arduino copatability and that all devices are available in conventional DIL packages.\r
\r
A schematic and board layout are included as a reference - but are still work in progress and not considered final - more of a starting point.  \r
\r
Since drawing the schematic I have subsequently moved to a different make of Magjack - which is not pin-compatible - please check your Magjack connections carefully.\r
\r
The Magjack came on a breakout-board available from Cool Components in the UK and SparkFun in the 'States.  Everything else is fairly standard, I didn't bother with 49.9 ohm resistors, 51ohm 1% work perfectly well.\r
\r
There are 2 spare buffers available on the 74HC125.  I've used these to make a wired serial network - see my blog \r

This design is the forerunner of "Nanode" which also features on Thingiverse.""" ;
