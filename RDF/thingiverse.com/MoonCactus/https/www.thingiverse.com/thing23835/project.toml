function = "The original Ultimaker caps add useless friction to the X/Y axis bearings, so I designed these instead. Best printed in Nylon for lower friction and more durability (or check the many derivatives of this thing!)  \n\nUpdate: added rounded/smoother version, slightly bigger and with optional bearing access hole (eg. to oil it if ever...)"
