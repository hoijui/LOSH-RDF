function = "Yet another set of feet for the ultimaker! \r\n\r\nUpdate: use the customizer for your own height: http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=25438\r\n\r\nThese are fully parametric, so that you can adjust the height and more from the constants. You can even tune the edge roundness ;)\r\n\r\nI needed them for a 50mm power supply upgrade, and those I could find on thingiverse did not suit me (imho, either ugly or non parametric, or both).\r\n\r\nThere is a hole tailored to the bolts that come with the ultimaker, so you can add a soft pad below the feet then, or just screw one for a thighter fit."
