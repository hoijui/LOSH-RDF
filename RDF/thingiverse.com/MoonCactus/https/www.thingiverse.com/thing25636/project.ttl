\r
I had some trouble printing an acceptable cone for the two bowden clamp things: they were a bit slippy on the inside unless I destroyed them in the riser by screwing them too much...\r
\r
This one:\r
- features inner rings to add radial but non-uniform clamp force on the tube, which works really nicely\r
- is (still) fully parametric so you can tune it to your tube diameter, riser internal diameter and printer fuzziness...\r
\r
Thanks to owen of course for this very nice thing :)""" ;
