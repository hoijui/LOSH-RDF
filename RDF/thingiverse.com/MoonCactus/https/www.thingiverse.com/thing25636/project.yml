function: "Update: tweak your own according to your printer and setup: http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=25636 !\r\n\r\nI had some trouble printing an acceptable cone for the two bowden clamp things: they were a bit slippy on the inside unless I destroyed them in the riser by screwing them too much...\r\n\r\nThis one:\r\n- features inner rings to add radial but non-uniform clamp force on the tube, which works really nicely\r\n- is (still) fully parametric so you can tune it to your tube diameter, riser internal diameter and printer fuzziness...\r\n\r\nThanks to owen of course for this very nice thing :)"
