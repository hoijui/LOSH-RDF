function = "I had a very large adapter to plug my vacuum cleaner hose into the skimmer of my swimming pool. And it finnaly broke (UV?). So I designed this smaller one.\r\n\r\nIt consists of two opposed cones, so they just plug in a standard 40mm pool hose (well, that's a standard here) and on the other side to the bottom of the skimmer (which is probably not standard!)"
