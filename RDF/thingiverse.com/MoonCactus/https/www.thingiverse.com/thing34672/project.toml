function = "This is an openscad script to generate a pulley for strings and ropes. It uses a 608 ZZ bearing (the cheapest and most common ones, used for skateboards and rollers, about $1-2 on ebay).\r\n\r\nWith the source, you can tweak most of the properties, or use another kind of bearings.\r\n\r\nThe groove cover, attachment leg and top housing are optional.\r\n\r\nI use these to lift bags of bird seed in my garage, out of reach of mices!\r\n\r\nThe pulley is to be screwed or nailed to a support on its own axis. However, the optional top cover makes it possible to hang it. The last picture show how I reinforced one that lifted about 50Kg."
