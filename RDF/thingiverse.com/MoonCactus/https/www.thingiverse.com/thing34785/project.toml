function = "I finally got rid of the very annoying and varying short belt sloppiness on my Ultimaker.  \n\nhttp://betterprinter.blogspot.fr/2012/11/short-belt-tensioner-for-nema-17.html  \n\nThis two-piece tensioner is simple, robust and it lets you adjust the belt tension with both precision.  \n\nIt also protects your case from abusive screwing/unscrewing of the stepper bolts.  \n\nDisclaimer: please make sure never to over tighten your belts as it becomes very easy to do so... It will not make your prints look better and you most probably would ruin the belts and/or your bearings! Simply proceed with care as usual!  \n\nUpdate: if you want a spring-loaded tensioner, this variant may better be what you want: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40041  \n\nUpdate: added a version to hold the stepper motor by its 4 screws, in case you use 4 independent cylindrical spacers on the other side of the wall. It will help pulling it straight."
