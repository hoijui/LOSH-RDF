http://betterprinter.blogspot.fr/2012/11/short-belt-tensioner-for-nema-17.html  

This two-piece tensioner is simple, robust and it lets you adjust the belt tension with both precision.  

It also protects your case from abusive screwing/unscrewing of the stepper bolts.  

Disclaimer: please make sure never to over tighten your belts as it becomes very easy to do so... It will not make your prints look better and you most probably would ruin the belts and/or your bearings! Simply proceed with care as usual!  

Update: if you want a spring-loaded tensioner, this variant may better be what you want: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40041  

Update: added a version to hold the stepper motor by its 4 screws, in case you use 4 independent cylindrical spacers on the other side of the wall. It will help pulling it straight.""" ;
