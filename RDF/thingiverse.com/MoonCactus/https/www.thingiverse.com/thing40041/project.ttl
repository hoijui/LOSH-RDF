    okh:function """This is an improvement to precisely set and keep a given belt tension by pulling the stepper motor downwards with a spring.  

Some people were asking for it in the original design, mainly to reduce the risk of over-tightening the belt.  

So here it is: obviously you'll need an appropriate spring and a fews more nuts & washers.  

Additionally, it might even compensate belt length variations during print if the stepper is kept slightly loose  

Update: I've added a 4-screw version, probably required if you do not have the wooden plates but 4 cylindrical independent spacers.""" ;
