function: "This is an improvement to precisely set and keep a given belt tension by pulling the stepper motor downwards with a spring.  \n\nSome people were asking for it in the original design, mainly to reduce the risk of over-tightening the belt.  \n\nSo here it is: obviously you'll need an appropriate spring and a fews more nuts & washers.  \n\nAdditionally, it might even compensate belt length variations during print if the stepper is kept slightly loose  \n\nUpdate: I've added a 4-screw version, probably required if you do not have the wooden plates but 4 cylindrical independent spacers."
