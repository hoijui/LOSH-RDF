function = "This is a drop in replacement for the Ultimaker, though it should prove useful on other printers with belts with an X/Y moving head, such as the makerbot (it is all parametric: belt, rods, bushing etc)\r\n\r\nIt also embeds a novel and precise belt tensioner thanks to a sliding banana. No? Really!\r\n\r\nJust have a look at the \"exploded\" STL view to know why!\r\n\r\nNb: these are for the Ultimaker gantry rods, so 6mm for the two central rods, 8 mm for the outer with a bushing of ~11mm (outside diameter). But the source can be adapted to other diameters (probably not smaller though)."
