\r
It also embeds a novel and precise belt tensioner thanks to a sliding banana. No? Really!\r
\r
Just have a look at the "exploded" STL view to know why!\r
\r
Nb: these are for the Ultimaker gantry rods, so 6mm for the two central rods, 8 mm for the outer with a bushing of ~11mm (outside diameter). But the source can be adapted to other diameters (probably not smaller though).""" ;
