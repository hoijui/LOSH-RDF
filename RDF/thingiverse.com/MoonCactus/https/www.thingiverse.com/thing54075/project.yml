function: "I had some slight longitudinal free play in my rods. Some were making noise when the head brutally changed its direction on a diagonal movement. It probably did not help making better prints also.  \n\nSo I re-designed my caps once again. This time I embedded one nut in the internal side, and it becomes very easy to prevent any rod from moving on its axis.  \n\nUpdate (thingster derivative): you can also add an external secondary nut in order to lock the screw very tightly (as show on the first picture). Else you may like the thicker but more efficient derivative by thingster which embeds a nylock nut."
