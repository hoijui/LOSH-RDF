function: "I have made me a couple of spindle boxes. To fix the spindle to the  swivel plate I have created a center guide, this one fits to a swivel plate with an 55mm center hole.\r\n\r\nTo stop the filament from doping of the spool, have I made a handful of clips that catches the filament. All the spools are of the same type even though they are from different suppliers, so perhaps there is some sort of standard for those. (DIN 8559)"
