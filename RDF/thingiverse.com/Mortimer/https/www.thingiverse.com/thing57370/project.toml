function = "A mount that allows the printer to be isolated and bolted down.  My friend J. Ferrari helped me with this one.  \r\n\r\nThe pictures also show my entire printer platform setup.  I wanted to be able to move the printer, spool, and power supply as one unit.  It double isolates the printer from the table, and there is an access hole in the bottom so I can get to the electronics."
