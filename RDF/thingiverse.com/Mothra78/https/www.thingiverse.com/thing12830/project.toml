function = "I participated in a kickstarter campaign to fund the pulse sensor: http://pulsesensor.com/. I recieved it and it's great but I thought it would be nice to make an autonomous heart rate monitor.\r\nSo I added to my arduino a Nokia 5110 LCD that you can get from Sparkfun, adafruit or ebay.\r\n\r\nAfter some coding I had a nice heart rate monitor with text and some nice graphics and thought I should make a case to make it even nicer. After a few minutes in sketchup I had a case for the LCD that I am sharing today.\r\n\r\nI also included the arduino code if somebody is interested it is based on the code from the creators of the pulse sensor and the excellent Nokia 5110 library from adafruit (https://github.com/adafruit/PCD8544-Nokia-5110-LCD-library).\r\n\r\nAdded a variant using TV Out for those which do not have a LCD screen. you will need the TV Out libraries that you can find on http://code.google.com/p/arduino-tvout/"
