function = "If you watch the web series 'Lets Play Minecraft' from Roosterteeth (most well known for the Red Versus Blue Halo series), you will no doubt know what the Tower of Pimps is. Made in Mincraft out of one block of Obsidian and four blocks of Gold, the Tower of Pimps represents victory in the face of utter defeat. For several episodes the Tower of Pimps was erected in front of that players house in Achievement City for winning the weeks challenge. You too can now erect the Tower of Pimps on your computer desk!\r\n\r\nFake towers from the original Tower of Pimps challenge have been included. This includes the one quarter, one half and three quarter Tower of Pimps. Also included are the Tower of Tetris... who are also false gods in the eye of the Tower of Pimps."
