function = "We have been integrating larger FLIR cameras like the A615 into smaller UAVs for USDA and NOAA, and now there is a new line of tiny, cheaper (relative) Ax5 machine vision cameras.  These are small enough to fly on many hobby-grade multi-rotors.\r\n\r\nThis mounts fits the FLIR Ax5 Series of compact thermal cameras, and lets them attach to a 1/4\"-20 thread."
