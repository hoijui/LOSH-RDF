function: "This thing is for curtain rods that are generally found in a closet, the thick wooden dowel type.\r\n\r\nI can buy the dowels for $5, make these hangers for $0.75 each, and will be uploading end pieces that will probably be around that price as well.\r\n\r\nPainting the wood to match the plastic (I printed in gold, although I'll be honest it looks more like brown,) was another $13 for a quart.  Overall the price per curtain setup will be around $10, compared to a minimum of $20 in the store, (more if the end pieces are fancy at all.)"
