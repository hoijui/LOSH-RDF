As can be seen in the artist's rendering, I'll be doing a few aesthetic mods and as I learn more about this machine, some functional mods as well.\r\n\r\nEven though these are meant to bring character to my personal machine, I figured I'll share them for others to enjoy too!\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more awesome!  ^__^"
