So I got this problem...  Ya see, I moved the guts of my computer from its cheap, cramped chassis to an older but more spacious 4U rack-mount enclosure.  My computer is happy but I'm not.  WHY!?!  Because it has no front panel for USB!!!  Not a problem.  I'll just take one of my extra headers and bring it up front through the 3.5" bay that I don't use.  WAIT!!!  Now it's ugly.\r
\r
OH, WHAT AM I TO DO!?!...  Oh yeah.  That's right.\r
\r
I designed this specifically to fit my spare I/O header from a LianLi mid-tower case.  It has holes for FireWire, USB and Audio.  I don't know if it will be of use to anybody else, but I've included the part file as well.\r
\r
Enjoy!\r
