Put it to work!\r\n\r\nThis is the first design of my KaptonCaddy!  Just place your roll of tape on the base, and slide in the caddy core.  It snaps together and becomes a handy carrying-case for your allen wrenches, nuts, bolts and other sundries.  It has two swivel drawers, holes for tools and a basin up-top for bigger stuff.\r\n\r\nUPDATE V1.1!\r\n\r\nThe base is now part of the body.  The tape roll now acts as a sleeve to hide the drawers.  If you store any over-sized things in the top (like calipers) you may need to remove them to lift the roll off.\r\n\r\nTest print #2 on its way!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
