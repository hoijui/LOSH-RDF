function: "My new YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnnw56J_TeOsF4M_F5pPPJQ\r\n\r\nVery much a work in progress!  This is an odometer for filament!  It should measure filament by the centimeter so you can have a real measurement for filament used!  The base it attaches to slides on to the counter assembly, so you can chose different mounts for it, but the first mount is for a ToM endcap.  \r\n\r\nI'm currently printing the first set of parts to validate the design, after some tweaks, I'll upload the first working design to share and build from!\r\n\r\nThe next version will have a second resettable counter.  I will also provide just the counter mechanism as a separate \"thing\" once I make sure everything works okay."
