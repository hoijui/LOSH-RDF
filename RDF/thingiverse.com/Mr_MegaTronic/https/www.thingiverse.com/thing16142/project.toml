Well now you can claim to be able to print ONE FOOT* OF PLASTIC!\r\n\r\n* Warning:  Claim may be pun.\r\n\r\nBut seriously though, this was a test print while I continually try to get my printer to meet my unrealistically high quality expectations.\r\n\r\nHope you get a kick out of this!\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI added an approximately \"full-size\" model of just the top half of the foot.\r\n\r\nI'm satisfied with the quality."
