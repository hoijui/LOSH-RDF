Here we go!\r
\r
This is the first experimental part for my Makerlele project! \r
\r
The Makerlele is a 3d printable Ukulele!  This is very much a hypothetical project and there is no telling if it will hold a tune long enough to play a song. BUT!  The fun is in the try and who knows, there may be a way to make it work!  ;)\r
\r
This is a worm gear string tuner.  The parts are supposed to print to maximize strength and smoothness of rotation.  On the stem, there is a square core which prints laterally to give it flex strength when the string is under tension.\r
\r
I just made a test block for it all to mount to to experiment with the design before I incorporate it into the head of the Makerlele.\r
\r
I tried to design it to be totally printed but I'm not sure how the tolerances are or the overhangs on the worm.  I will print this when I get home from work!\r
\r
Stay Tuned!\r

\r
The idea is sound but the implementation needs work...\r
\r
I'm glad it printed though but yeah...I gotta re-think this design a bit.""" ;
