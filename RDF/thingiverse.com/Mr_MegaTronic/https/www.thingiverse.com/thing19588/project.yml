function: "My new YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnnw56J_TeOsF4M_F5pPPJQ\r\n\r\nHere we go!\r\n\r\nThis is the first experimental part for my Makerlele project! \r\n\r\nThe Makerlele is a 3d printable Ukulele!  This is very much a hypothetical project and there is no telling if it will hold a tune long enough to play a song. BUT!  The fun is in the try and who knows, there may be a way to make it work!  ;)\r\n\r\nThis is a worm gear string tuner.  The parts are supposed to print to maximize strength and smoothness of rotation.  On the stem, there is a square core which prints laterally to give it flex strength when the string is under tension.\r\n\r\nI just made a test block for it all to mount to to experiment with the design before I incorporate it into the head of the Makerlele.\r\n\r\nI tried to design it to be totally printed but I'm not sure how the tolerances are or the overhangs on the worm.  I will print this when I get home from work!\r\n\r\nStay Tuned!\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/IIEtNb_Vo9Q\r\n\r\nVIDEO!\r\n\r\nThe idea is sound but the implementation needs work...\r\n\r\nI'm glad it printed though but yeah...I gotta re-think this design a bit."
