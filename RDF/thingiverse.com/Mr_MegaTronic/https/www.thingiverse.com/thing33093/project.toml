You can store other things in it too!  I'll upload a lid without the \"Lunchbox\" line a bit later after my print of this completes and then the source files.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  After printing the lid, it's obvious the hinge and the lid are a bit flimsy for the task at hand so if you print the files that are up right now, do so at 100% infill for the best strength.  \r\n\r\nI'll update this with a re-thought snap and hinge shortly.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
