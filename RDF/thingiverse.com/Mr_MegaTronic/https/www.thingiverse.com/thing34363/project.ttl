This fully 3D printable ukulele (save for bolts and strings) uses an acoustic transducer to carry the lower frequency sound created by the strings to a very thin membrane on the bottom of the body.  The sound is focused and projected out of channels in the body to (hopefully) create a fuller tone with reasonable amplitude.  \r
\r
I am still working on the design of the head and tuners.  Right now, to have a good gear ratio for the prototype, I made the gears almost comically large.  \r
\r
UPDATE!!  \r
I'm refining the design of the geared tuner head but I wanted to test the tonality to see if I was getting somewhere so I quickly designed a test friction head and tuning knobs to try it out.  \r
\r
I have uploaded all the current parts for everyone to TEST this EXPERIMENTAL design!  Have fun!  \r

A couple of notes:  I am tweaking the body design.  The bridge is a little wonky and the transducer pops right off!  I have to think that one over a bit.  The bottom membrane is only two layers thin.  It is tricky to print and even trickier to remove from the platform. BE SUPER-CAREFUL TO NOT TEAR THE MEMBRANE OFF!  \r
\r
The sound the first prototype makes is bright as expected but it is pretty loud.  A good sign!  \r
\r
NOTE:  This friction head is for testing only, it will no longer hold a tune after a while without shims or other "friction-enhancers."  The geared tuner is the solution to this, I'm just working to make it a better, more reliable print.  \r
\r
Stay tuned!  \r
