A 3D-printed plastic hammer.   \r\n\r\nThis lean, mean, ball-peen is ready for your general clobbering needs!  And while it won't drive a galvanized nail into a pressure-treated fence-post, it will dutifully bludgeon interior nails, bang tight-fitting objects together, annoy individuals with experimental jazz percussion and acceptably intimidate others when held menacingly.  \r\n\r\nUPDATE(s)!  \r\n\r\nV2 - The peen has facets now to promote better printing at smaller scales and in general.  \r\n\r\nsudo THWACK - a request from Vik, this is useful for executing \"bash\" commands.  \r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and want to help me do more, please consider supporting me on my Patreon page!  http://www.patreon.com/ErikJDurwoodII  Thanks!"
