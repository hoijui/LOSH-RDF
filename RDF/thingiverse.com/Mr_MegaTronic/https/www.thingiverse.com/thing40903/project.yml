Let me be your angel, Charlie!  \r\n\r\nThis is the first revision of a shower head intended to screw on to a standard 1/2\" threaded shower pipe.  \r\n\r\nPressurized water is a tricky thing to deal with; especially with 3D prints.  The nozzles on this are designed to keep turbulence low and under adequate pressure, the taper on the business end of the hole should keep the water stream solid.  They are pretty small holes so they will likely close up a bit when printing but when you use a pushpin or paperclip to check them, they should be just the right size in the end.  \r\n\r\nUPDATE!  I just installed my prototype and D'OH!  I had the thread going the wrong direction!  Still, I muscled it on and it sealed alright.  The holes were closed shut after the print and once the plastic cooled, they were hard to open with a pin.  Still, It works pretty darn well!  There was some water that seeped through the layers and I'm certain water will become trapped inside the head but if you print at .2 or even .1 mm layer height, print it pretty much solid and maybe dunk it in acetone for a second or two, it should be nice and watertight!  \r\n\r\nI updated the file with the correct thread and fewer/larger holes.  \r\n\r\nSpray away!  \r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and want to help me do more, please consider supporting me on my Patreon page!  http://www.patreon.com/ErikJDurwoodII  Thanks!"
