BB King is here to help!  \r\n\r\nThis is a proof-of-concept print to evaluate using standard BB bullets as the rolly bits in a 3D printed bearing.  I'll be using what I learned from this in some projects I have coming up!  \r\n\r\nVIDEO:  http://youtu.be/3pl6-AXtWZY  \r\n\r\nI'm using 6 mm plastic BB bullets and I printed my prototype in ABS at .1 mm layer height, 10% in-fill and with 3 shells on my original Replicator.  \r\n\r\nI had to scale the model up a hair and that is reflected in my THING file.  The STL files are original scale.  \r\n\r\nENJOY!  \r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and want to help me do more, please consider supporting me on my Patreon page!  http://www.patreon.com/ErikJDurwoodII  Thanks!"
