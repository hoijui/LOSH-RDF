The back hatch secures the money and access to the coin mechanism's locking pins.  The collar around the jar keeps the jar from being removed.  \r\n\r\nThe hole on the top will take a preserving lid ring for a standard \"medium\" Mason jar.  That lets you thread the jar to the top, and the collar will secure it in place.  Or you can go totally legit and print the provided jar file.  (not .JAR file).  \r\n\r\nAlso, this version is EXTREMELY generous.  For a quarter, it will give you about a dollar's worth of M&Ms, Skittles, Mike and/or Ikes, Chiclets or glass marbles.  \r\n\r\nI don't recommend the marbles.  \r\n\r\nI'll provide a few different drums to adjust the generosity of the machine soon.  \r\n\r\nUPDATE:  I've uploaded all the STL files.  My prototype is still printing so I'll hold off on the source files until a legitimate test.  \r\n\r\nStay tuned!  \r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and want to help me do more, please consider supporting me on my Patreon page!  http://www.patreon.com/ErikJDurwoodII  Thanks!"
