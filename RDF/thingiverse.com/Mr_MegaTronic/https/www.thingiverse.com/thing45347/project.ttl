\r
Here is my Magnum Opus for the week!  \r
\r
VEND is a totally 3D Printed candy dispenser that accepts quarters and rejects other coins.  \r
\r
VIDEO:  http://youtu.be/IWuvwcfnGFE  \r
\r
Not only that, it has been designed so that once the loops in the back are secured with a padlock or whatever, it can't come apart (without damage).  The back hatch secures the money and access to the coin mechanism's locking pins.  The collar around the jar keeps the jar from being removed.  \r
\r
The hole on the top will take a preserving lid ring for a standard "medium" Mason jar.  That lets you thread the jar to the top, and the collar will secure it in place.  Or you can go totally legit and print the provided jar file.  (not .JAR file).  \r
\r
Also, this version is EXTREMELY generous.  For a quarter, it will give you about a dollar's worth of M&Ms, Skittles, Mike and/or Ikes, Chiclets or glass marbles.  \r
\r
I don't recommend the marbles.  \r
\r
I'll provide a few different drums to adjust the generosity of the machine soon.  \r
\r
UPDATE:  I've uploaded all the STL files.  My prototype is still printing so I'll hold off on the source files until a legitimate test.  \r
\r
Stay tuned!  \r
