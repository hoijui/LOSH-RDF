Maker Special Edition - MakerBot Thing-O-Matic.  \r\n\r\nDuring the fall of last year, I was commissioned to bring to life an idea I had following the arrival of my original MakerBot Replicator.  \r\n\r\nThis idea was to take a totally stock MakerBot Thing-O-Matic (with MK7 Stepstruder and LCD Control Panel), dismantle it and using ONLY the parts from the original machine and new parts printed on a MakerBot Replicator, re-assemble the printer in a new, stylized enclosure.  \r\n\r\nThis is the result.  \r\n\r\nThis project was kept under wraps during development and was delivered to MakerBot HQ in late November.  Its home was to be on display at the new MakerBot HQ and now that they have moved most of their operations to the new place, it is there for all to see!  \r\n\r\nOver the next week I will be uploading all of the parts (there are over 100 right now), then an assembly guide and following that, the source files.  \r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, this took a bit of time.  The modeling took a couple weeks assuming 6 hours of work every weekday.  The printing took even longer due to prints failing, running out of plastic and the nature of ABS plastic.  \r\n\r\nAs I upload the parts, I will be committing to the design some last-minute manual modifications I had to do to get things to line-up after printing so the new prints should be alright.  \r\n\r\nHere is a video of the first-run and the z-axis cable arm articulation.  \r\n\r\nVIDEO:  http://youtu.be/vDVkBUTwUZY  \r\n\r\nHere's an animated exploded view!  \r\n\r\nVIDEO:  http://youtu.be/XnzJYecA2cs  \r\n\r\nIn the end, it was able to print pretty well (at least as well as the Thing-O-Matic it was).  It is VERY study.  The corners of the box are each one three-sided part and there is a \"spine\" that holds it all in-line.      The mainboard and extruder controller have been moved up front inside the console along with the control panel so the USB, SD Card and reset button are easy to access.  The stepper drivers can be accessed from the side-panels and all of the belt tensioners can be adjusted without disassembling anything.  \r\n\r\nThis is my most complex design yet and while I don't think many people will be printing this plastic-hungry beast, I hope some of the parts or design queues could be useful to others, inspire improvements or inspire new things!  \r\n\r\nI will be adding files in batches over the next week so if you \"watch\" this thing, you will know when I have updated it.  This will forever be flagged as a \"work-in-progress\" but if at least one person makes a successful copy, I will be very glad.  \r\n\r\nThanks for all your follows, likes, collects and watches on this and my other designs.  For a designer, this kind of support keeps my fire hot and the plastic flowing!  \r\n\r\nIf you like what I do and want to help me do more, please consider supporting me on my Patreon page!  http://www.patreon.com/ErikJDurwoodII  Thanks!  \r\n\r\nRespectfully,  \r\nBrent J.
