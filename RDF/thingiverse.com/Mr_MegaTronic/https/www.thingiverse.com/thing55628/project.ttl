\r
In the quest for 3D printed liquid containers, the okay just got okay-er!  \r
\r
While working on a different project, I needed to make a part that fit to a disposable flask's threaded opening.  So I designed the neck of the opening and printed it to check the compatibility with the existing cap.  It worked great so I was able to design that project and move along.  But I was left with a threaded tube with nothing to do!  \r
\r
The PhLAsk is just a simple hip flash with a threaded cap.  I printed it in black PLA at 220 micron layer height, three shells and 20% in-fill.  \r
\r
I filled it with water and left it in a dish overnight and it looks like there is no seeping.  The cap doesn't seal 100% but it does so well enough to keep water from dripping out with gravity.  A little pressure will cause a seep though.  A gasket will fix this.  \r

I have not tested other liquids with different surface tensions but for casual liquid portability, I will be using this little guy!  \r

Bottom's up!  \r
