function = "Building on from the great work of u-design.\r\n\r\nDuring assembly of Automatic belt tensioner for RepRap Prusa Mendel by u-design i discovered I did not have any mudguard washers.\r\n\r\nThese mudguard washers have a small step close to the inside hole to prevent binding of 608 bearing and washer.\r\n\r\nBefore this I could not get great looking prints (arcs were not even due to constant slipping due to loose y-axis belt).\r\n\r\nA welcome side effect is the I have decreased the voltage to the Y-axis stepper resulting in cooler running :D\r\n\r\nOnce again thanks to u-design."
