\r
During assembly of Automatic belt tensioner for RepRap Prusa Mendel by u-design i discovered I did not have any mudguard washers.\r
\r
These mudguard washers have a small step close to the inside hole to prevent binding of 608 bearing and washer.\r
\r
Before this I could not get great looking prints (arcs were not even due to constant slipping due to loose y-axis belt).\r
\r
A welcome side effect is the I have decreased the voltage to the Y-axis stepper resulting in cooler running :D\r
\r
Once again thanks to u-design.""" ;
