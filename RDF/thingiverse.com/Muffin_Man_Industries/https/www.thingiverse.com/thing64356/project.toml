function = "My Father-in-Law bought a JOBO GPS tracker for his DSLR camera on ebay but it was missing the button to log where you have been (it still worked when taking photos).\r\n\r\nThe side of the unit had an ugly hole, so I printed a button to go in its place. It worked first go and so I'm very happy (and I used my printer for its first useful job for someone else).\r\n\r\nHopefully someone else can use it (although that's unlikely!!)."
