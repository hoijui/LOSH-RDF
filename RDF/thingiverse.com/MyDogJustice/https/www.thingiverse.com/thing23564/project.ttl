    okh:function """Wanna really make them eat lead at the office?!  How about a pencil holder modeled after a revolver cylinder!  I've always wanted one of these sitting on my desk.\r
\r
I made an exact model of the cylinder from a Smith & Wesson .44Mag and increased the size by about 40%.  \r
\r
Cylinder is about 60mm x 60mm and the holes are 15.5mm.  I cant find a standard Sharpie, but it looks as if one would fit.  \r
\r
I'll be using one in the office for pens and one at home as a tool holder!  I might even print two for the work bench and color code some tools. Base stand makes it nice and stable.  Extractor is really just for show and to finish the model.  I kinda threw that piece together this morning, so it might go through a revision when I have some time. Maybe someday I'll make it functional.""" ;
