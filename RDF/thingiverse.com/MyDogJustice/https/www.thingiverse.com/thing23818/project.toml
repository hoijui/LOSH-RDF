function = "Tesseract, hypercube, 4-cube.  Whatever you want to call it, this one is a tricky print!\r\n\r\nWith some pretty steep overhangs, this one seems to be a bit tough by my standards.  Although some of you may find no challenge at all.  I've got one on the printer right now that is half way finished.  It'll complete at this point, its just gonna have some hangers that need trimmed off!  Pic to follow\r\n\r\nGive it a shot without support if you're into small perimeter massive overhang geometric prints!\r\n\r\n63mm x 63mm x 63mm"
