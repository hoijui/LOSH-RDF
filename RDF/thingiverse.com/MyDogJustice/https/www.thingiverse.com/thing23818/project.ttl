\r
With some pretty steep overhangs, this one seems to be a bit tough by my standards.  Although some of you may find no challenge at all.  I've got one on the printer right now that is half way finished.  It'll complete at this point, its just gonna have some hangers that need trimmed off!  Pic to follow\r
