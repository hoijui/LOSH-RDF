function = "In Japanese folklore the female demon (oni) Hannya figures prominently. Often depicted in traditional Noh and Bunraku plays using a wooden mask of a fierce and grimacing horned demon, this malicious entity may be Japan's most well-known demon. \r\n\r\nI've always been drawn to Japanese style art and find these masks fascinating.  Its my first go around making one.  I tried to stay with a traditional look while adding some of my own embelishments.  Terribly hard to not make a demon look too sinister.  I may have another go (or two) at these masks\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
