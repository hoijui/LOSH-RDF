    okh:function """My latest obsession has been collecting, and subsequently photographing silver coins.  Coins have been one of the hardest subjects I've photographed.  Its just the begining of a long process, but I wanted to design something that would give me consistent, even and low angle lighting all the way around the coin.  Quick Rhino design later, some soldering and I'm in business!  Simple electronics, simple print, stunning results! Gives a nice focused light at the center. The coin pics I've included were actually shot with a webcam.  It was the easiest solution and provided the fastest feedback.  Eventually I'll get out the big rig and take some really hi-res images.  There is a cutout archway for sliding in coins that are already in graded slabs and an optional pedestal for open coins.\r
\r
This light doubly functions as an odd little look through flashlight.  I've used it quite a few times in the network closets already!""" ;
