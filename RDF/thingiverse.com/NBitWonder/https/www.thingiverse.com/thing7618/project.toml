function = "Version 1.1 of the NBitWonder DC Motor Driver.  This project is a simple dual-channel DC motor for robotics and other hobbyist projects. The project uses hand-solderable parts (no under-chip pads), and fits completely on a single-sided PCB, making it easy to print or fabricate using homebrew PCB methods. The board is designed to be cheap, with parts costing ~$10 in quantity 1 (without volume discounts).\r\n\r\nThe project was originally designed as drive electronics to be used in conjunction with Marc Raiser's Tank project: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6554 (Tank v2 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8080 is explicitly modified for use with this board). Design files are posted here, but for the most up-to-date documentation and technical data, refer to the project's github repository, which can be found here: https://github.com/NBitWonder/DCMotorController\r\n\r\nThe project is the result of hard work by members of the NBitWonder community.
