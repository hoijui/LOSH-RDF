function: "I am one of the unfortunates whose original-style z-rod lowers both delaminted at original assembly time.  I repaired them, and they have been fine, but it has been in the back of my head to work up a re-design...  then AO released : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15861\r\nThis piece incorporates everything I had in mind...  except that Thing was designed to use 608 bearings.  I have the \"original\" thrust bearings for z-motor load reduction, so I derived this version implementing the hole sizes from maxbots' original piece."
