function = "Necessity (and personal preference) are the mother of invention, right?\r\n\r\nThese ends are installed on my MendelMax, with over a dozen print-hours on them and I am extremely happy with the Acme rods and these ends.  I hope others may, also.  I have them listed as \"a work in progress\", but honestly do not forsee making further modifications.\r\n\r\nI desired to move from regular threaded rod to Acme rod and found inexpensive 3/8-12 oil-finish Acme rod at Enco.  I then began looking at available X-end designs...  and found Aleph Object's variation of their great clamp-style ends :  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14812\r\n\r\nClose, but not quite exactly what I wanted.\r\n\r\nFeatures of these ends are double-nut with spring column for anti-lash and head-crash protection with integrated spring \"perch\" or \"seat\", fully-enclosed double LM8UU bearing column, \"improved\" x-rod clamping area, and an integrated nut-trap and screw for z-endstop mech switch triggering."
