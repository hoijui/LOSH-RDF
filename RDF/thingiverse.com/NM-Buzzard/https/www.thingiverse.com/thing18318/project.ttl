These ends are installed on my MendelMax, with over a dozen print-hours on them and I am extremely happy with the Acme rods and these ends.  I hope others may, also.  I have them listed as "a work in progress", but honestly do not forsee making further modifications.\r
\r
I desired to move from regular threaded rod to Acme rod and found inexpensive 3/8-12 oil-finish Acme rod at Enco.  I then began looking at available X-end designs...  and found Aleph Object's variation of their great clamp-style ends :  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14812\r
\r
Close, but not quite exactly what I wanted.\r
\r
Features of these ends are double-nut with spring column for anti-lash and head-crash protection with integrated spring "perch" or "seat", fully-enclosed double LM8UU bearing column, "improved" x-rod clamping area, and an integrated nut-trap and screw for z-endstop mech switch triggering.""" ;
