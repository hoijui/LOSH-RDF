These are designed to address three things about the "original" y-rod mount...  #1 - these allow you to choose whatever rod-spacing you desire.  #2 - these allow 100% maximum travel of your print bed within the limits of your frame (the original y-rod mount could, depending on your table design, interfere with travel by as much as 15mm front and back).  #3 - take advantage of the superiority of the MendelMax extruded frame to absolutely level your y-rods\r
