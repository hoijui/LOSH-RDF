function: "Camelbak charge ten English pounds for a piece of plastic to hang the bladder and keep it open for drying. This thing does the same job, but you can probably laser cut it for about a tenth the price.\r\n\r\nThe square notches wedge in the opening of the reservoir. Tested in 3mm acrylic and it works fine, but 5mm would probably stay in place even more easily."
