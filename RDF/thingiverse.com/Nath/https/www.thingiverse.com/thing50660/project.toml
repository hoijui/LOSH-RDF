function = "Chain mail (or a scratchy fabric) designed for the limitations of 3D Printing. Has been designed to have no overhangs and 45 degree max span angles. Can probably squish it down height wise for smaller prints.. But how it is is conservative. \r\n\r\nWill look at enhancing the design a bit to perhaps make it more aesthetically pleasing or gentler on the skin on the pointy side. \r\n\r\nIs quite flat on the down side so should stick nicely to the bed."
