Made as a statement to the other Klein Bottles on Thingiverse that there are formulas for these things which aren't quite as rotund. I originally planned to have the Klein Bottle itself on here but realized that \r
(1) it's a surface, which would require it to be thickened, which is something Mathematica doesn't to on export (plus inside-outside problem)\r
(2) Skeinforge might throw up on the self-intersections.\r
\r
So for now, Thingiverse has to be content with its short Klein bottles and this... bracelet?""" ;
