function: "While it's not the usual representation, it's topologically equivalent! (And almost fits on your finger too!)\r\n\r\nMade as a statement to the other Klein Bottles on Thingiverse that there are formulas for these things which aren't quite as rotund. I originally planned to have the Klein Bottle itself on here but realized that \r\n(1) it's a surface, which would require it to be thickened, which is something Mathematica doesn't to on export (plus inside-outside problem)\r\n(2) Skeinforge might throw up on the self-intersections.\r\n\r\nSo for now, Thingiverse has to be content with its short Klein bottles and this... bracelet?"
