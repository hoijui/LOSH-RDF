function = "After the previous attempt at making a Klein Bottle that actually looked okay (see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12359) , I present to you:\r\n\r\nYet another Klein Bottle!\r\n\r\nWhat's so special about this one? Well, no modeling at all was done on it (the shape comes directly from the Mathworld article (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KleinBottle.html))\r\nand it's still printable!\r\n\r\nDisclaimers: There's a slight ridge around the edge of the bottle, as well as a ridge around the nozzle. Both are defects of the widening algorithm I used. Additionally, it's not quite nonsupportable, there's still a small bridge at the top which will require some filing.\r\nLastly, do not drink from klein bottle. It doesn't actually taste that good and it isn't waterproof."
