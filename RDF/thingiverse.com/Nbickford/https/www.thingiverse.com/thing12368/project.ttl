\r
Yet another Klein Bottle!\r
\r
What's so special about this one? Well, no modeling at all was done on it (the shape comes directly from the Mathworld article (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KleinBottle.html))\r
and it's still printable!\r
\r
Disclaimers: There's a slight ridge around the edge of the bottle, as well as a ridge around the nozzle. Both are defects of the widening algorithm I used. Additionally, it's not quite nonsupportable, there's still a small bridge at the top which will require some filing.\r
Lastly, do not drink from klein bottle. It doesn't actually taste that good and it isn't waterproof.""" ;
