Incomplete as it is, I thought I'd post it as it developed.\r\n\r\nIt is based on this:\r\nhttp://www.act.sys.okayama-u.ac.jp/kouseigaku/research/okamoto_wobble_06/english.htm\r\nInstead of air chambers, I plan on rolling my own solenoids, eventually.\r\n\r\nIt also uses hypo-epicycoidic gearing, based off this:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28237 \r\n\r\nAnd it should move like this:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UayBAHJQE_k\r\nBut instead the outer ring 'wobbles'.\r\n\r\nThe wobbleRing is 1 tooth larger than the drivenGear(51/50). This allows for 2.4 degrees between solenoid steps(360 / (50 * 3)). But that's with just one of the 3 solenoids pulling at a time.\r\n\r\n Now why did I use cycloidic gearing? Well, I understand they wear a little slower for this application. Also I was really having a time getting the MCAD library to work. Please correct me if there is a better gear profile for this application.\r\n\r\nI do also appreciate any constructive critism, as this is my first openscad project.\r\n\r\nBEWARE: I have not printed this thing yet!\r\nI really wish I could but I am still waiting for mine. \r\n\r\nBEWARE: There be snakes in dem codes; look at the openscad code at your own risk!\r\nI really do intend to add more paramaters too, just working out the basic form first.\r\n\r\nOh and for now there are no solenoids included. At this point I really don't know enough yet to design capable ones."
