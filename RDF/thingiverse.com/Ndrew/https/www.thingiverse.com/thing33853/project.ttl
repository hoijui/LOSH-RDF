\r
This is my humble start on an actuator that could be mostly printed on a 3d printer. Incomplete as it is, I thought I'd post it as it developed.\r
\r
It is based on this:\r
http://www.act.sys.okayama-u.ac.jp/kouseigaku/research/okamoto_wobble_06/english.htm\r
Instead of air chambers, I plan on rolling my own solenoids, eventually.\r
\r
It also uses hypo-epicycoidic gearing, based off this:\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28237 \r
\r
And it should move like this:\r

But instead the outer ring 'wobbles'.\r
\r
The wobbleRing is 1 tooth larger than the drivenGear(51/50). This allows for 2.4 degrees between solenoid steps(360 / (50 * 3)). But that's with just one of the 3 solenoids pulling at a time.\r
\r
 Now why did I use cycloidic gearing? Well, I understand they wear a little slower for this application. Also I was really having a time getting the MCAD library to work. Please correct me if there is a better gear profile for this application.\r
\r
I do also appreciate any constructive critism, as this is my first openscad project.\r
\r
BEWARE: I have not printed this thing yet!\r
I really wish I could but I am still waiting for mine. \r
\r
BEWARE: There be snakes in dem codes; look at the openscad code at your own risk!\r
I really do intend to add more paramaters too, just working out the basic form first.\r
\r
Oh and for now there are no solenoids included. At this point I really don't know enough yet to design capable ones.""" ;
