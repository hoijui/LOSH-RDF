function: "Just an idea for a printable piston I thought I'd jot down. It is designed to be printed without infill. The render is a cutaway, to show the bellows.\r\n\r\nI *hope* this little thing extends downward as it is inflated from the top. Probably not much of a stroke until it is tuned properly.\r\n\r\nI would like to use this thing to make a \"pneumatic stepper motor\" like my other thing:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33853\r\n\r\nAny feedback is welcome."
