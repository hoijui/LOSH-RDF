function = "This is a snap together version (some glue) of my printable motor. It has been shrunk and uses only 9 pieces, air pistons included.\r\n\r\nThe bellowPiston part is printed with no infill and needs to be airtight. When inflated it extends outward to push the glued on bellowLink part. The bellowLinks then push the wobbleRing, meshing with the drivenGear. Each piston is inflated and deflated sequentially to \"step\" the motor 4 degrees forward or backwards.\r\n\r\nThis thing is the successor to this:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33853\r\n\r\nAnd uses sgcg's fastener library\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15915\r\n\r\nAlso uses mechadense's epi-hypocycloids from:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28237\r\n\r\nThe bellows used are modeled after this general shape:\r\nhttp://www.f295.org/main/content.php?120-Paper-Gaffer-s-Tape-Bellows\r\n\r\nThough I hope this latest version shows much improvement, I realize there is always room for better design. Please, chime in if you see room for improvement.\r\n\r\nI also have to mention that I have not printed this yet, so I don't know if it will work. Of biggest concern are the bellowPiston parts, because they need to extend at least 2mm to be productive. I also don't know how easy it will be print 45 degree overhangs that are airtight AND slightly flexible."
