function = "For a party with a Moulin Rouge theme my wife wanted a matching hairpin. (Moulin Rouge means Red Mill and is the name of a famous night club in Paris)\r\n\r\nLucky for her I have a Prusa standing here, so I whiped up this thingy.\r\n\r\nI put one of these led-candle imitations inside so it looks like there is a party going on inside. If you don't want lights inside you can skip printing the back cover.\r\n\r\nThis print also doubles as a test for my bridge settings so make sure your bridges are setup correctly before printing this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.s. yes I know it's black but red didn't match the dress :-)"
