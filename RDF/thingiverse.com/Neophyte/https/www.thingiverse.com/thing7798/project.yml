function: "This is just a universal tri-pod mount platform to adapt for other uses. (that's to say if these mounts are made to standard dimensions)\r\n\r\nI have included the Solidworks part file for those with access to Solidworks to change it and adapt it for whatever you want to mount on a tri-pod."
