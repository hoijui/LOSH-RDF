    okh:function """Some time ago I made a holder / mounting-box for my GPS unit due to the non-existence of units specific to different GPS makes/models. Back then I used a metal elecronics enclosure but it was still not ideal or professional looking although it didn't look too bad and did the job.\r
\r
Enter the 3D printer...\r
\r
Now I was able to design a brand new custom box which will look 100 times better and also be easier to use.\r
\r
The large lower section is at this stage necessary to accomodate the power cable attachment that clips onto the GPS unit.\r
\r
I plan to eliminate the standard power cable and therefore the bulky lower box section. I want to integrate a power connector into the base of the holder and thereby eliminating the unsightly standard power cable. I can't "hide" the standard cable as I also use it in my car. Then I can leave it in the car permanently.""" ;
