    okh:function """I got my new HTC Desire HD 3 days ago and last night I sat and designed this tri-pod mount. Added some holes to make it not look too plain and obviously use a little less plastic too.\r
\r
I first printed a 3mm test piece to check for fit over the phone. It has a nice loose fit so you won't need to force the phone in and risk scratching it.\r
\r
I do have SW2010 part file available if someone wants to modify it.\r
\r
[EDIT] I used my Surface Mapping Tool http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7940 and a digital caliper to "map" the contour of the back of the phone. I just did one half and then mirrored the measurements for the other half. So, I can also give you the "map" sketch if you want to design your own stuff.""" ;
