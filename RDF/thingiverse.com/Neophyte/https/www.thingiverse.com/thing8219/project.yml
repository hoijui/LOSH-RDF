function: "I got this as a DXF file off the net quite a few years ago. Don't know where I got it exactly.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't have a build diagram for it so therefore it's a puzzle.\r\n\r\nMy wife did manage to figure out how it fits together. The parts we're unsure of is the little part on the end of the tail (df5.stl) and the two little round parts (df1 x2.stl). So we left out these two round parts"
