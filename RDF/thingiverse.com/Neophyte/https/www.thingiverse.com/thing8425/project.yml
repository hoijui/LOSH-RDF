function: "Yeah, I know it's easier and probably cheaper to go out and buy a new lanyard but where's the fun in that?\r\n\r\nThis is still a work in progress to get it working consistently.\r\n\r\nI have had trouble printing the female part successfully but due to the small base it had. I have made the base bigger and uploaded the file but haven't yet had chance to see if it prints good.\r\n\r\nI do need to make a slight adjustment to the male part as it doesn't clip into an \"original\" female consistently."
