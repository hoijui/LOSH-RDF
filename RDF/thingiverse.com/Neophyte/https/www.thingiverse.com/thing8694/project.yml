function: "Thanks to dino-girl for uploading the DXF file fo this design.\r\n\r\nI imported the DXF into Solidworks 2010, cleaned it up as the imports aren't always 100%, and saved each of the body parts as a seperate file as the DXF file had it all in one.\r\n\r\nI then checked for thickness of the parts by looking at the width of the connecting slots and modified my files accordingly."
