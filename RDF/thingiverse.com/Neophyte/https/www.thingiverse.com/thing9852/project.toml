function = "This handle would probably not be relevant to anyone else but I wanted to show it in any case. Who knows, someone might still find it useful so I included the Solidworks 2010 design files too.\r\n\r\nThe two end seats on our lounge suite are recliners and the release handle on the one broke about a year ago. Even though I've had my RapMan a few months now it only hit me about a week ago to design a new release handle for it.\r\n\r\nI split it into two pieces to make it printable without support."
