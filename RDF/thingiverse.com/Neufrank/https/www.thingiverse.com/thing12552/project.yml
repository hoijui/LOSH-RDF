function: "I just started learning how to use OpenSCAD and this is my first creation.  Making this also reminded me of some forgotten trigonometry to get the angles right between openings.  The angle between the diagonal of a cube and the base is the arccosine of the square root of 2/3.  The angle between the diagonal of a cube and an edge is the arcsine of the square root of 2/3.  \r\n\r\nI would love to see someone make this on a 3D printer.  However, I am just learning about the technology and don't know if it is even printable.  \r\n\r\nThese units can also be interlocked in various ways in one, two and three dimensions (at least on a computer).  A sort of three dimensional chain might be made."
