function = "This will let you mount a dynamo light to a bike that does not have a fork hole or somewhere for its normal bracket. it is meant for\r\n\"Herrmans H-Diver\" LED headlamp which you can get on ebay, but will work on other lights if you modify the spacing (or use some washers)\r\nLarger lights will need modification (extend the arm) but i wouldnt put any heavy metal lights on it.\r\n\r\nI printed this on a replicator, with 1 shell and 30% infill,.25mm layer height and 65mm/sec it is nice and light but seems very strong. you will need a m5 bolt which is a little bit longer than the one provided with the light, preferably with a washer and nylon locking nut (very common in bike shops)."
