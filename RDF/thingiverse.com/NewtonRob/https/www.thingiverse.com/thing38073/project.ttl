C-Spot is a simple robot that that will move towards a "Spot" of light when it "C"'s it.  Thus the name.  Or if you like C Spot run.  The original was made of wood, a wipes container, and rubber bands (plus the electronics).\r

I have uploaded a Bill of Materials.  The total cost is about $110 ($42 if you shop around).  I did not try to find the best prices.  Also consider that the Arduino might be useful for other projects. You might already have some of the stuff as well.  But this is the worst case.""" ;
