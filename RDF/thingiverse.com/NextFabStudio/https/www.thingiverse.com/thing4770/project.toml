It's a document, not an image, so the rendering doesn't seem to be working - anyone have some advice on this?\r\n\r\nThe STL file describes an additive manufacturing (3D printing) performance test coupon comprising a pair of 25mm x 25mm x 10mm blocks with hole, pillar, corner, and shelf features. The features are designed to be easily measured and to reveal the performance and limitations of the additive manufacturing system used to build the coupon.  This coupon was employed in the comparison tests of low-cost additive manufacturing systems published in our 3D Printer Buyer's Guide."
