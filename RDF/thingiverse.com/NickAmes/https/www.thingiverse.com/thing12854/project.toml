function = "This is a case for a USB stick/USB drive. The original (a 4gb PNY attache mini) case was ugly and poorly made, so I printed a replacement. \r\n\r\nNotice how my name is written on the side of the case. Unlike other manufacturing technologies, the cost of a 3D-printed object increases does not increase much with greater complexity.This creates interesting possibilities for embedding information within physical objects (in this case, the name of the owner of the USB stick)."
