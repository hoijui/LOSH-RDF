function = "This is a PostScript program to generate optical encoder wheels. Unlike other encoder generator programs, it is highly flexible and has many features, such as:  \n\n-   Correct inside and outside diameters, regardless of line width.  \n-   Quadrature capabilities, with adjustable phase difference.  \n-  Automatic scaling of text size.  \n-  Optional index track, with adjustable size or automatic fitting to segment size.  \n-  Automatic page filling with cutting allowances.  \n-  Most features can be turned on or off."
