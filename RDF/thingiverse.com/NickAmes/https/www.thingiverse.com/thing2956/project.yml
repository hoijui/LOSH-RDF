function: "This is a makerbot-printable dremel based milling machine, and my entry for the make/makerbot contest. I wasn't able to finish printing it before the deadline, so it is untested, and should be regarded as a prototype. After I finish printing, I will release a revised version that will fix any bugs that come up. \r\n\r\nThe axises move on dovetail slides. When completed, it will have a travel of 11cm on the x axis, 5cm on the y axis, and 10cm on the z axis. \r\n\r\nSo far, I have printed half of the x axis and part of the y axis. The dovetail slide moves freely with little slack or wobble, even though the print warped. This makes the rest of the machine look very feasible, and I'm confident that it will be able to machine aluminum (shallow cuts, of course) when it's finished."
