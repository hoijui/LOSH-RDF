    okh:function """This is a small two-wheeled robot designed for pattywac's bearing contest. It is similar to other robots available on thingiverse, but it is unique in that it does not use gearmotors or continuous rotation servos, but plain dc motors and a makerbot-printed geartrain.\r
\r
Although the printed geartrain is incredibly noisy and not terribly efficient, it is much cheaper than any gearbox that one could buy. Also, it's printed on the makerbot, which is pretty neat.\r
\r
Features:\r
-Makerbot Printable Geartrain (8:1 reduction)\r
-Printable without heated build platform\r
-3mm holes in chassis and cover for easy modification/expansion\r
-Can accommodate motors up to 25mm in diameter (comes set for 22mm in diameter) and up to 30mm long.""" ;
