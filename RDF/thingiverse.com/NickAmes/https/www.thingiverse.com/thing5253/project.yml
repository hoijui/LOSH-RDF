function: "This is a device that allows your Makerbot (or other cnc machine) to draw/print/cut on cylindrical or spherical objects, in the manner of the EMS EggBot (http://egg-bot.com/). It works by connecting one of the machine's axises to a stepper motor, which then turns the workpiece. \r\nThe workpiece is held between two centers (several designs included) which are supported by two brackets: one holds the stepper motor, and the other holds a 608 bearing. The brackets are mounted on a dovetail way, which allows them to be positioned on the base, to accommodate different workpieces. After positioning, the brackets are clamped in place."
