function = "This is another set of rises that clip onto 6 mm ply (on my Ultimaker) that fit the Ikea Dioder 16670 (801.194.20 in Australia). Although very similar to another thing, they are not a derivative (my models are attached). \r\n\r\nAs the LED strips are bigger than the top opening on the UM, one axis will need to sit above the other."
