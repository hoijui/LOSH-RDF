function = "That's a parametric screw clamp, useful for joining parts.  It can be used as a support for other tools, too. [[Work in progress]]\r\n\r\nThe difference between both parts lies in that: the first, screw_clamp_up, stays fixed to the rod, whereas the other one moves freely along it (the diameter of the hole is 1 mm bigger so that there is clearance).  In order to fix the final position or to tighten the grip, use two hex nuts or a wing nut."
