function: "Today I would like to show you a printable Rocker Blotter. I suppose  people who love the \"calligraphy world\" will know what it is, and how useful it may become. For people who don't know about it, a rocker blotter is an antique tool, used to dry the ink which doesn't dry so fast. With this tool, you avoid to damage your work letting rests of ink all around the paper.\r\n\r\nI made the code in C++, using the new OOML library (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17761 http://iearobotics.com/oomlwiki). So, If you want to change some of the parameters (measures) or work with this code to made some derivated or new desings, you should download this libray. Afterwards, you only have to open de project and modify the independent parameters (in RockerBlotter.cpp).\r\n\r\nHowever, I also add too the OpenScad generated code; although I think it isn't very intuitive to change. (I really advise you to work with OOML)."
