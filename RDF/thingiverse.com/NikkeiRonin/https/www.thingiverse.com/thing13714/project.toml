function = "This is a slightly modified design of Shoji Desk Lamp for LED light. \r\nI have a bunch of tea candles around and wanted to see if they would work.\r\nIf you are using tea candles you cannot put on the top design. It cause the wood to char and glue to melt. There are a number of led tea lights that should do the job if you would like to use the top face."
