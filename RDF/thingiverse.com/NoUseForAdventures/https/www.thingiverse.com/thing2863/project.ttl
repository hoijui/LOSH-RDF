    okh:function """A major improvement (i hope) upon my first pinhole camera design. Fully functional and with a few easy steps, ready to use.\r
\r
Features:\r
-Film advance and rewind dials\r
-a clicker to tell you how far to advance the film. (8 clicks per frame)\r
-a shutter with a safety, so you don't accidentally take a picture of the inside of your bag\r
-a removable viewfinder\r
-an easily loadable film carrier, that slides in and out of the camera body (little rails on the inside to keep it in place)\r
-PRINTABLE ON A MAKERBOT (and probably on a RepRap too)\r
\r
 This time it's fully functional, and only requires a few pieces of hardware to assemble and use:\r
-a small cabinet hinge, to mount the door\r
-two machine screws\r
-two wing nuts\r
-four 10mm long screws, to put the film carrier together\r
\r
Also needed:\r
-A soda can, to make a pinhole\r
-Electrical tape, to tape the pinhole\r
-3m (or other brand) foam tape, to seal the door\r
\r
More explanation and instructions to come within the next week.\r
Thanks for looking!\r
