function: "A major improvement (i hope) upon my first pinhole camera design. Fully functional and with a few easy steps, ready to use.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-Film advance and rewind dials\r\n-a clicker to tell you how far to advance the film. (8 clicks per frame)\r\n-a shutter with a safety, so you don't accidentally take a picture of the inside of your bag\r\n-a removable viewfinder\r\n-an easily loadable film carrier, that slides in and out of the camera body (little rails on the inside to keep it in place)\r\n-PRINTABLE ON A MAKERBOT (and probably on a RepRap too)\r\n\r\n This time it's fully functional, and only requires a few pieces of hardware to assemble and use:\r\n-a small cabinet hinge, to mount the door\r\n-two machine screws\r\n-two wing nuts\r\n-four 10mm long screws, to put the film carrier together\r\n\r\nAlso needed:\r\n-A soda can, to make a pinhole\r\n-Electrical tape, to tape the pinhole\r\n-3m (or other brand) foam tape, to seal the door\r\n\r\nMore explanation and instructions to come within the next week.\r\nThanks for looking!\r\n\r\n\r\nPinhole Camera Mark II by Connor Hollenback is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at nouseforadventures.blogspot.com."
