\r
Second of all: Versions here are the original files, only tweaked for toner transfer purposes. \r
\r
These are some files for DIY pcbs with Toner Transfer, for Mendel. \r
Images for printing top bottom and silk are all 600 dpi.\r
\r

\r
* image file for ATX / ATX2 voltages takeout + UM232R footprint boards: \r
A4 file ready for transfer, 600 dpi. For ATX supply, the board allows access to all voltages without any modifications to the supply. The UM232R i made because it looks better on a proper board.\r
\r
* stepper motor driver v3.0 for toner transfer +A4 layout: i never got time around to test this because i jumped to vers 3.3, but should work; nonetheless, use at your own risk\r
\r
* stepper motor driver v3.3 for toner transfer: changed smd from 0805 to 1206; increased pcb size and spacings accordingly; some provisions(â€just in caseâ€): 7805 can be fitted with a small to radiator (totally not needed but i like the overkill) and can be moved around abit if needed; smd versions electrolitic capacitors could be fitted (for smd connect the vias nearby with bottom layer); alternative jumpers instead of the dip switch; alternative 0.100â€ pins connectors for motor; 2 opposite diagonal holes for an A3977 radiator (overkill heatsink higly recommended), and some holes underneath A3977 that are just something like chip vent; can use pots with pitch of 5/5mm also (besides 5/2.5mm); \r
-the version named Makerbot: has 6 pins idc and no min/max, as it was in the original file;\r
-the version named Mendel: has 10 pins idc and .100 min/max of 3 pins each for compatibility with current mendel Gen3 Electronics and specifically Mb v1.2\r
I dont think i was inspired in getting the right versions names, but i am always lacking inspiration :))\r
\r
* MB 1.2v: A4 file with tqfp pads edited, ready for transfer, 600 dpi: orientation of the board on the file would of been better horizontal, but then wouldnt fit one near the other. Check photo paper shrinkage (on vertical direction) with a real piece of .100 pins along their pads. Use good quality board materials for this one. RepRap modifications included (no longer compatible with other makerbot version): as per http://www.reprap.org/wiki/PCB_adaptions_for_Mendel the bridge near icsp header area, bridge(s) in atx connector area (leading to two traces in bottom layer to be combined on the top area of sd card - looks weird but its ok).\r
\r
* added EC 2.2v: A4 file with tqfp pads edited, ready for transfer, 600 dpi. I did my own EC22 with a version that was almost at the size and spacings of the original file, and after doing it like that i decided it needs further spacing out and more severe cleaning up which i did in the file. As a result the images linked and the file are slightly different, and the last version should be better. However be warned, i did not tried this last version in real life myself, although i think it should work: use at your own risk, etc.""" ;
