function = "\"I used to be a reprapper like you, then I took an arrow in the knee\".\r\n\r\nNow you can fake a knee related arrow injury with this exclusive prosthesis! (Will also work for most other body parts).\r\n\r\nIt comes with everything you need to make your own arrow as well. The .scad file is somewhat parametric so you can tweak it to fit your needs. The holes are 9-10mm, and you can change out the arrow itself with a twig or a dowel if you prefer.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone complains about the color of my print, let's just say my printed arrow is supposed to be a glass arrow.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see someone print this and put in a proper arrow, though. :)\r\n\r\nIf you are clueless about this whole thing, take a look here: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-took-an-arrow-in-the-knee"
