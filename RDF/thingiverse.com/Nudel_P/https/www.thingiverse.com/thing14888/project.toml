function = "I present to you, the RepRap tie!\r\n\r\nUpdate 12.30.2011: Added minecraft stl one one 20x20cm build plate and individual pieces in zip file. Yet untested! Don't know how well the holes will print when laying flat, please leave feedback if you try.\r\n\r\nUpdate 12.30.2011: Added a stl file of a tie made from a stl file. Check out tie_stl.zip for source code. Not yet printed!\r\n\r\nFor years people have made ties out of wood, and I adopted the principle for 3d printing. Could it be a world first?\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to take a 3d model, cut holes in it for string and then cut it into smaller pieces so the tie will bend.\r\n\r\nI'm not overly satisfied with how the ties sits around the neck, perhaps someone has an idea for a better solution?\r\n\r\nAlso, any special ideas for a tie, just make a comment and I'll give it a go. :)"
