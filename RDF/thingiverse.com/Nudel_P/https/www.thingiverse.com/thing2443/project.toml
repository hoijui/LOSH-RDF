function = "Parametrized Magnetic Bit Holder In 2 Parts\r\n\r\nNo more misplaced bits! Sandwiched design with strong 8mm magnets. You don\\'t have to glue the magnets in place (and thus spoil them) if you don\\'t want to.\r\n\r\nThe supplied .stl files are made to fit two rows of five magnets, put together in pairs for increased strength (20 magnets in total). All parameters can be changed in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nThe 8mm magnets are available at dealextreme.com.\r\n100 pack - $5.96 - http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.13518\r\n20 pack - $2.36 - http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.4248\r\n\r\nI'm working on a experimental version which clips together, needing neither glue nor screws, hopefully. We'll see how that works out...\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I use OpenSCAD, how did I do?"
