\r
UPDATED 2011.10.27: V2 now has facial features and a better chain attachment.\r
\r
The design itself belongs to Mojang and all that. Go ahead and buy Minecraft if you haven't already: http://www.minecraft.net Be warned though, it's highly addictive!\r
\r
I've had this model for a while, but didn't know what to make of it, when someone suggested a creeper keychain. So here it is.\r
\r
The picture with the key attached is the first test, I'm getting there, but there is still calibration to do on my Mendel.\r
\r
The Minecraft/creeper related "cartoon" is best viewed in orginal size, or here: http://repraprip.blogspot.com/2011/03/coalition-of-obsessions.html\r
