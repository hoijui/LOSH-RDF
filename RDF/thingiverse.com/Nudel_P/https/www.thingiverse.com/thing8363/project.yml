function: "A small, simple keychain in the shape of the surprisingly scary little creeper from Minecraft.\r\n\r\nUPDATED 2011.10.27: V2 now has facial features and a better chain attachment.\r\n\r\nThe design itself belongs to Mojang and all that. Go ahead and buy Minecraft if you haven't already: http://www.minecraft.net Be warned though, it's highly addictive!\r\n\r\nI've had this model for a while, but didn't know what to make of it, when someone suggested a creeper keychain. So here it is.\r\n\r\nThe picture with the key attached is the first test, I'm getting there, but there is still calibration to do on my Mendel.\r\n\r\nThe Minecraft/creeper related \"cartoon\" is best viewed in orginal size, or here: http://repraprip.blogspot.com/2011/03/coalition-of-obsessions.html\r\n\r\nIf you want a large creeper, take a look here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8346"
