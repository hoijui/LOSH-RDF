function: "A simple holder for a simple thermometer from dealextreme. It's parametrized in OpenSCAD, so you can easily adapt it for other similar equipment.\r\n\r\nI use mine to read the temperature of my manually controlled heated bed, and you can't have anything like that attached with strips when you have a 3d-printer.\r\n\r\nThe sensor itself is taped to the top of the bed glass plate, and provide adequate accurate readings. About 5-10 degrees off I reckon.\r\n\r\nAs you see in the picture I printed it a little on the small side, so it bulges a bit."
