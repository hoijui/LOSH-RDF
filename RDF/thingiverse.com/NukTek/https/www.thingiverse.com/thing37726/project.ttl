The plaque is to read \" THIS IS A ROUND TUIT! Guard it with your life. Tuits are hard to come by, especially the round ones. It will help you become a much more efficient worker. For years you've heard people say \"I'll do this when I get around tuit.\" So now that you have one, you can accomplish all those things you put aside until you get around to it.\"" ;
