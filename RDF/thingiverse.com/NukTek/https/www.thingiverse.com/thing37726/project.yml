function: This is my take on the old "round tuit" joke. I made this file using artcam with the intent of casting it in brass, mounting it on a plaque, and giving it as a Christmas present. The plaque is to read " THIS IS A ROUND TUIT! Guard it with your life. Tuits are hard to come by, especially the round ones. It will help you become a much more efficient worker. For years you've heard people say "I'll do this when I get around tuit." So now that you have one, you can accomplish all those things you put aside until you get around to it."
