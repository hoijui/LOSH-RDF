function = "This is a simple hook for over the top of an internal door. It's proven to be a very popular item round the house, with multiple hooks on some doors!\r\n\r\nThe design is derived from a headphone hanger which has a neat curve on the flat of the hook, adding significant strength. I've made the off-side quite narrow so a door can close, even with the hook fitted, presenting the hook within the room.\r\n\r\nIt's very strong and looks well when printed in white ABS, with a layer height of .25mm, but I'm sure it will work in PLA, sliced as you prefer.\r\n\r\n\".stls\" included for a variety of Internal door thincknesses. I've also included a Sketchup file which has a variety of widths (15mm, 18mm for wardrobes and drawers, 35mm, 40mm, 45mm for doors and 60mm for work cubicals)."
