function: "Lynx was a side project of mine for some time now. I wanted a building toy that could connect (almost) any direction like K'nex, and could fit into a grid pattern like Lego. I sat down and started turning out design concepts. And here it is. Lynx! Lynx uses a specific pin to connect them all. This is from tbuser's Pin Connectors.\r\n\r\nIf there is another building toy like this, I have never seen it."
