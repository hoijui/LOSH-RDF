function: "Here are 2 locks. One has a closed hasp ans no keyhole. The other has an open hasp and a keyhole. It will fit on a M3 bolt by using it as a washer.\r\n\r\nOriginally for the Occupy Thingiverse event, now renamed to a more friendly feel. Makerbot made their stance, and I support where they are going, though right now seems a little bit rough."
