function = "Nothing original here, just standing on the shoulders of giants and copying their designs/ideas (see gator clip, horseshoe clip).  This smaller clip is for holding down the orange acrylic plate that Makerbot uses for a build surface.  The plate tends to warp a bit after several uses, and a couple of strips of double stick tape along with these clips appears to solve the problem.  Hope you find it useful."
