function = "Septagon box 20 mm per side, 25 mm deep. Why a septagon? Well, partially because the wikipedia says, \\\"is not constructible with compass and straightedge but it is constructible with a Makerbot.\\\"  Okay, I added the Makerbot part.  Anyway it was fun, and I\\'m going to store my four leaf clover inside this seven sided box and set it next to the Makerbot during every build -- at least until I learn more about Skeinforge."
