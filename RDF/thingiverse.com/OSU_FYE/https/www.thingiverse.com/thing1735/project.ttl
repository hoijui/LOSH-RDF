Okay, does your LCD just seem to always be in the way when working with your microcontroller?  Never fear, Makerbot to the rescue!  This odd little piece has a side slot where the edge of the LCD fits, and a hole for a #6 threaded rod in the bottom.  Make all 8 connections down to the center connector and free up your breadboard space!  You will lose pins 0 to 5 for this resource hog, and the code to run these things in pbasic is nasty, but it works!""" ;
