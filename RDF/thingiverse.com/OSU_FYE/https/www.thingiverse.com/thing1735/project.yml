function: "Okay, I\\'ll admit it, we have a BasicStamp board.  There I said it.  Before the flames descend, let it be known that there is also an Arduino system or two floating around and I have a similar project in mind for them.  Whew!\r\n\r\nOkay, does your LCD just seem to always be in the way when working with your microcontroller?  Never fear, Makerbot to the rescue!  This odd little piece has a side slot where the edge of the LCD fits, and a hole for a #6 threaded rod in the bottom.  Make all 8 connections down to the center connector and free up your breadboard space!  You will lose pins 0 to 5 for this resource hog, and the code to run these things in pbasic is nasty, but it works!"
