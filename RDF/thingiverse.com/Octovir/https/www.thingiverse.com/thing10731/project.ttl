\r
Now I am designing and rebuilding it, testing and learning and really enjoying it. \r
\r
Some pieces survived and I had initially thought to design things as a replacement/upgrade. Now I think that would be silly to tell people to "Print these, and buy these 'special' parts", so I am making the attempt to make this frame fully DIY...\r
\r
I haven't really been documenting the process, but initially it seemed there would be a slight weight savings in the carbon fiber/ABS parts vs the stock arducopter aluminum/acrylic parts. \r
\r
Maybe some different construction methods could be used to increase savings?\r
\r
This is very much a work in progress, but thought I'd get the idea out in order get some feedback and enable collaboration.""" ;
