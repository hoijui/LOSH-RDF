function: "So I purchased an Arducopter Pre-assembled and tested, Something I rarely do.  Maybe it was a subconscious action then, that within a week I had smashed it into the ground?\r\n\r\nNow I am designing and rebuilding it, testing and learning and really enjoying it. \r\n\r\nSome pieces survived and I had initially thought to design things as a replacement/upgrade. Now I think that would be silly to tell people to \"Print these, and buy these 'special' parts\", so I am making the attempt to make this frame fully DIY...\r\n\r\nI haven't really been documenting the process, but initially it seemed there would be a slight weight savings in the carbon fiber/ABS parts vs the stock arducopter aluminum/acrylic parts. \r\n\r\nMaybe some different construction methods could be used to increase savings?\r\n\r\nThis is very much a work in progress, but thought I'd get the idea out in order get some feedback and enable collaboration."
