function: "I got different motors for my bodgie incarnation, so I designed some different arms to mount them on..\r\n\r\nIt seems common place to use nylon/plastic screws on quad/multi-copter builds.. Which I don't have an abundance of.. which got me thinking about alternatives: the zip-tie, cheap, easily available, gotta be fairly strong right?\r\n\r\nWell it turns out I don't have an abundance of 2mm screws either.. Short story shorter, this is an experiment in using zip-ties to mount small quad-copter motors. I have also designed an arm with holes to mount the motors with screws, but have not printed it.."
