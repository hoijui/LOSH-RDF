    okh:function """So I got frustrated by my larger, complete redesign of my arducoper, and instantly fell in love with brucedjones's bodgie design. I also really want to do FPV so I redesigned the way the Aeroquad board mounts to allow for an X configuration. I did this by moving the arm mounting holes out about 1mm, So you can still choose a Plus configuration if you want.\r
\r
The lower platform was designed extremely quickly as burn out was starting to set in here as well.. A quick GoPro mount was added to this and I had plans to make a quick AV transmitter mount, but booleans and maya weren't cooperating...\r
\r
I have just rubber banded the RC rx to one of the arms for now, but may look into a more proper way to keep it on.. Maybe an upper cage to protect electronics and constrain wires?...\r
\r
I have really only flown once so far.. about 3 minutes of hovering around while mosquitoes were trying to eat me..\r
\r
It oscillates a little with the 1500mah batt and I had a few hops with a 2200 and it was really unstable, so It will need some PID tuning..\r
\r
FPV electronics and Gopro may make things a bit heave, esp with a 2200mah batt..\r
\r
Though holding in my hand at about 2/3 throttle I was showing about 10 amps coming out of the battery, which is a bit promising.. between 1/2 to 2/3 throttle seemed to be about hover position.. again only one flight and distractions..""" ;
