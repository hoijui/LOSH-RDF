\r
Not to completely reinvent the wheel, I incorporated a few of those designs and made the thing modular.\r
\r
After many Boolean operations, and due to poor planning, I accidentally created a locking feature with a ridge on the opening of the grenade body.\r
\r
I got griped at for taking this into a public place.. I really didn't consider that either..""" ;
