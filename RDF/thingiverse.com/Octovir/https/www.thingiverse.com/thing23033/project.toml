function = "I am slowly assimilating my RCExplorer.se / David WindestÃ¥l tricopter into a 3D printed version.\r\n\r\nHis design is heavy on zipties, but where I am, I can only find the cheap kind that break before you even tighten them..\r\n\r\nI have yet to redesign the tail section or mid body section. I think a mid body section that folds more like a tripod would be cool..\r\n\r\nI also plan on adding things like a prop shroud so that if I run the thing into my face again, it will cause less damage. :D\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Reference see: http://www.rcexplorer.se/projects/tricopterv25/tricopterv25.html"
