function: "As the original design using a micro switch and an EXTREMELY long screw is, unstable as the printer works and shakes around. I decided to reinvent the design where the switch is the part you move up or down to adjust the Z-axis. This system has been running on mine for 5 days, and haven't moved at all.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I made a new holder-part, which now will press at the center of the moving part, thereby want tilt the switch and/or break the holder when tightened"
