function = "This is a printable caterpillar robot with gear wheels and links -kind of tank-like ;) .\r\n\r\nThis is part a project developed in the UC3M university in which we are designing printable robots. \r\n\r\nHere, we have together all the pieces that form this robot, but you can have a look at the different parts pages to see some other people modifications -specially at the links. \r\n\r\nTake into account that this is a work in progress.Though this robot works as it is designed now, it can be improved a lot -and this is in what we are working right now. Some of the pieces -in their own pages- are parametrized, while others are still pending.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesigners:\r\n\r\n Olalla Bravo www.thingiverse.com/olalla\r\n Daniel GÃ³mez www.thingiverse.com/dannynoc\r\n\r\nA special thank you to Obijuan www.thingiverse.com/obijuan for printing us the pieces, providing useful advice and remarking us some obvious design mistakes and, in general, leading us into the nerdy way =p . Another thank you also to our other professor Alberto, for his advice,patience and invitations to have some coffee.\r\n\r\nIndividual pages for the pieces:\r\n Gear wheels and links: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7209\r\n Chassis: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7681\r\n Parametric gear wheels: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7794\r\n\r\n UPDATE: \r\n \r\n We've got a video of the robot in motion!!\r\n http://youtu.be/gRsKRrQQHos\r\n\r\n Update 4/13 23:52  \r\n\r\n The chassis now includes four drills in order to hold the PIC with the micro that controls the servos above the chassis. Also, the hole that it had so that some material could be saved has been removed in order to sustain better the PIC. \r\n\r\n Update 4/14 14:08 \r\n \r\n Added the parametric version of the gear wheels that we are using in the design.\r\n\r\n Update 4/20 00:28 \r\n\r\n  The comments of the links scad file have been translated into English. I hope this will help to understand better the code and that it will make easier modifications of the file."
