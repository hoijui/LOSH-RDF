This version tries to overcome the problems found in version 1.0 and also it has become completely parametrizable.\r\n\r\nMore documentation of this robot can be found at http://mrgroup.dyndns.org/mrgroup/doku.php?id=robots:orugator:orugator_v1.1\r\nIt is especially recommended to have a look at that page in order to understand better the notation of the parameters used in the different files of openscad since it includes the drafts of the different parts. \r\n\r\n Update \r\nI have added the stl files that we are actually printing :)  For the moment we have one wheel and some links surrounding it\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:9532\r\n\r\nUpdate 21/5 \r\nWe've started to print the robot. Here it goes a video of the links and the wheels\r\nhttp://youtu.be/NoXAF5WsLn0"
