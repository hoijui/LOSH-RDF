function = "Here's a printable pulley for GT2 belts with a 2mm pitch.\r\n\r\nUpdated using drofart's excellent parametric pulley design here; http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16627/\r\n\r\nProbably useful for anyone who doesn't want to customise the pulleys in openscad.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend the 18 tooth pulley over the 17 tooth pulley, since I find it's harder for the belt to engage the smaller pulley perfectly. Might just be me though, let me know if you have any success with it.\r\n\r\nFewer teeth (More resolution) and smaller hub with two nut traps."
