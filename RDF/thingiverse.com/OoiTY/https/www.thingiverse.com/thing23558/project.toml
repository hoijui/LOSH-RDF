function = "This is for those who didn't get self tapping screws (like me!) and had to resort to longer M5 screws with a spacer for the blind joints on the top vertex of the Mendelmax.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it'll make this particular joint a bit neater, and prevent extrusions breaking from overtightening.\r\n\r\nThere's a little recess for a washer, which is still recommended.\r\n\r\nDesigned for the Mendelmax 1.5 in mind, with it's smaller Z-ends."
