function: "Updated by this; http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:92028  \n\nAs popular as the designs for X-carriages with 40mm fans between the rods are, they cause a loss of x-axis travel of at least 10mm per fan. With 20mm fans like I use, this means there'll be a total of a 40mm reduction. The goal for this design is to maximize the amount of X-axis travel while still having 2 fans.  \n\nAlso, uses Zipties to secure the bushings to the carriage, since I noticed that regular designs for bushing carriages crack around the bushings.  \n\nThis is designed for 16mm bronze bushings, I got mine from techpaladin. Modeled in Rhino, unfortunately for openscad fans. Feel free to modify the original files."
