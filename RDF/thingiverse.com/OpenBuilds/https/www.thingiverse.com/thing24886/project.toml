This, along with Open Rail's unique ability to adapt to many different aluminum extrusions configurations makes it the most versatile linear rail system available today. The linear V guides have been around for a long time. The problem in the past has been mounting them to existing extrusions.  This can be difficult and unconventional. Open Rail was designed to make installation a breeze (easily installs with included screws and t-nuts) and completely customizable unique to each machine.   \r\n\r\nNOTE: The pictures included are quick renderings to give a few examples of what could be possible. They do not represent complete machines...Yet! :)   \r\n\r\nThank you  \r\nOpenBuilds Team"
