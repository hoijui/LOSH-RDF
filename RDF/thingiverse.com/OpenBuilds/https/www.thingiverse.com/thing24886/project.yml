function: "The OpenRail\u2122 system was created by Mark and Trish Carew of http://www.OpenBuilds.com   \r\n\r\nUPDATE V9.Zip added to include VSlot\xAE Extrusion Framing System  \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:69333  \r\n\r\nOpenBuilds\u2122 Parts are now available in many easy to use and share formats!   \r\nIncluding STEP / IGES / SolidWorks / SketchUp Please see the OpenBuilds Parts Resource section here to grab'em. http://www.openbuilds.com/resources/categories/openbuilds-parts.5/  \r\nThank you and all the best with your builds!  \r\n Mark Carew  \r\n\r\n**Example builds**   \r\n[OpenBuilds\xAE](http://openbuilds.com/ \"OpenBuilds\")  \r\n\r\nOpen Rail is a new Open Source Universal Linear Rail System designed to be used in conjunction with various sizes of readily available T-Slot aluminum extrusions.  \r\nThe Open Rail system will be made of 6061-T5 Aluminum with Black Hard Coat Anodized, Type III, which means we will have the ability to use both metal v wheels for heavy wear light duty applications and plastic v wheels for quiet light duty applications. This, along with Open Rail's unique ability to adapt to many different aluminum extrusions configurations makes it the most versatile linear rail system available today. The linear V guides have been around for a long time. The problem in the past has been mounting them to existing extrusions.  This can be difficult and unconventional. Open Rail was designed to make installation a breeze (easily installs with included screws and t-nuts) and completely customizable unique to each machine.   \r\n\r\nNOTE: The pictures included are quick renderings to give a few examples of what could be possible. They do not represent complete machines...Yet! :)   \r\n\r\nThank you  \r\nOpenBuilds Team"
