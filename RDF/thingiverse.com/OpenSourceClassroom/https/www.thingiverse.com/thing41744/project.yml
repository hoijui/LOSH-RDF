function: This was made to simplify 5lb reel changes.  There are (4) 19mm diameter bearings with 6mm hole that fit into the flange covers.  The rods hold the bearings in a good position to feed the filament into the extruder. Using a t-slot nut and a bolt, the rods fasten tight to the 30mm x 30mm aluminum extrusions.
