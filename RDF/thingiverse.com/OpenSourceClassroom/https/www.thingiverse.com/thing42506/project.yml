function: This LED light system is perfect for illuminating the printer bed to allow for close and careful examination of your model while it is being printed.  There are (6) 3V, 20mA LEDs that are angled to shine down directly on the bed.  This addition was carefully designed to confine with the sleek concept of the Aluminum Mendel and still keep all wires and components inside the frame area.  Wires are tucked into the grooves of the aluminum extrusions and the on/off switch is located in the back right corner (does not interfere with the y-axis bed travel).  Having the LED light system attached to the frame instead of on the extruder keeps from adding excessive wires and weight the the extruder carriage (which can hinder print quality and increase vibrations while printing).
