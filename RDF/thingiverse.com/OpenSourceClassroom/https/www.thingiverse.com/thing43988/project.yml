function: Having problems with clogged nozzles?  I have a dog and just can't keep his hair from floating to the reels.  This little device can help prevent clogged nozzles by running the filament through a cloth before it enters the extruder.  I didn't know how well it was going to work until I printed all day with it on and was amazed as to how much dust and crap was caught by the cloth.  Enjoy!
