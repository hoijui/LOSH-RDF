Notice that the weight of the tracker is NOT putting pressure on the servo motors.  The pitch gear is nestled inside the bracket which reduces wobbliness and makes the installation look professional.  For the horizontal gear system it just made sense to attach the entire panel mount directly on the gear.  It makes for a really solid structure.  This was my first attempt at a project like this. Let me know how it works out if you build one...  Enjoy!  \r\nHere are video links:  \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbksReSEpJc  \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqACH3WS-w8  \r\nHere is a simiar project with no printed parts:  \r\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Solar-Tracker/"
