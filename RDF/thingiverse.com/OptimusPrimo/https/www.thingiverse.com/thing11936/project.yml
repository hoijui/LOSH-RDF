function: "He's got zee crazy eye, maybe you shouldn't trust him with your parts...\r\n\r\nEntry for the MakerBot Challenge running up on GrabCAD.com.\r\nLike to think I pulled out all the stops for this guy.\r\nThe gears mesh and roll (here's a quick animation http://vimeo.com/29635250), the arms sway, the grips grab, and the neck is fully articulated. Never done any sort of 3D printing, but I'm fairly certain all the bits should be printable, tried to be sure there aren't any monster overhangs. If any experts would like to tell me where I goofed, that would be killer."
