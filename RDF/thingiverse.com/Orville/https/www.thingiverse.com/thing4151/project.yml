function: "A couple of years ago my young grandson  was knocked over by a falling tree as he was putting on the  decorations .\r\n\r\nThe flimsy stand had collapsed so I came up with this. They are currently rotationally molded here and to date after 4 years of sales we have not had a single failure.There are 3x 8 mm eye bolts around the top which thread though tee nuts embedded at the time of molding."
