function: "Another poker chip holder, however this one takes 5 different poker chips, as thats how many types I usually have when I play. It's size should allow it to fit onto a normal print surface.\r\n\r\nDimensions: 140 x 111 x 25 mm\r\n\r\nIt should be able to hold about 11-12 normal thickness poker chips, if your doing really well I suppose you'll need to stack them elsewhere...\r\n\r\nIf it turns out to not hold enough, I may end up lengthening the grooves for more poker chips to fit into."
