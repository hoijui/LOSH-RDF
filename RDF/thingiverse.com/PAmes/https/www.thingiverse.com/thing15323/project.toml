function = "This is like jpcw's SD Card Holder, but on my TOM/Mk7 I needed the slots a little looser.  So this looks a lot like his, but is parameterizable.\r\n\r\nThere are several parameters.  The main one is for the number of slots.  You can also adjust the size of the slots, if you want a tighter or looser fit.  (You can also adjust other aspects, like the angle that the top rises from front to back or the car separation distance, if you're a control freak.)"
