Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/h8VBT82HsZW\r\n\r\nNot really sure these are a good idea ;) But after getting hit several times today by spitballs from my son I decided we would print a rocket to shoot out of the straw. Standard questions about getting one in your eye apply, but they arenâ€™t sharp. As far as accidentally inhailing one I recommend using a bendy straw and bending it at a right angle for play. They are long enough that they canâ€™t be sucked around the bend."
