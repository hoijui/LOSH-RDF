A hook to hold my iPhone up out of the water yet still close enough to hear the music or audiobook. Designed to hold my own iPhone 4, though tall enough for a 5 but wider and thicker as necessary to manage the skinny case I have it in. You may want to adjust both the width of the hook for your own shower doors as well as the width of the iphone slot. I forgot to add the holes on the bottom for the speakers and to drain any water that got in there, so I just drilled them after the printing. Dont forget to remove the support bar that prints up to hold the top corner. See picts.""" ;
