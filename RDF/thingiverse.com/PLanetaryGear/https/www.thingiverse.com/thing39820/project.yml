function: 'inspired by, but not directly derivative of, this beautiful thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38722 I decided to make one that would fit my disk drives which sit and spin all day in a warm server closet. This is my first project working with OpenSCAD so it has few fancy features like rounded corners, but does automatically calculate the cooling hole placement based on the size you enter.'
