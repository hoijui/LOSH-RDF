function: I use a lot of these wonderful data capture cards from weedtech.com since they are supported by the home automation system of which I am a developer MacHomeAutomation.com unfortunately they dont have good mounting options. in the past I've just hot glued, or cable tied them in place but this is much better. After attaching to this frame I was able to attach them more securely.
