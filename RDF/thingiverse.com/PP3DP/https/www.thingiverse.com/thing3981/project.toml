function = "The original STL is too big, So I have reduced the facet. This is to test that the bearing is printable, but there will be support structure needed. It takes us 1 hour and 11 minutes to print, and only another 3 minutes to remove the support structure. The support is very easy to remove. As long as the support structure is cleaned up,  it will be slippery enough. (edited on Sep6)"
