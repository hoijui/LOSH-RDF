function: "This extruder is modified to return to the original handedness of Wade's extruder(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1794), while retaining the new designs of Greg's Accessible Hinged Extruder(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8252).  The holes match the original wade's design as well, so that this is a drop in replacement for Wade's Extruder when using a steel hot tip from TechZone.  If only thingiverse allowed dual ancestry, we would credit all of the things listed here.\r\n\r\nThe gears started off as the Herringbone Geared extruder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5111) by rhys-jones, and have been modified a little bit. The gears have been slimmed down where possible, and now have beveled edges as has been seen on designs floating around.  They should maintain the gear ratio of a standard Wade's extruder.  \r\n\r\nWe are still revising this design, so any suggestions are welcome and will be factored into new revisions.  Version 0.8 will print fairly well, with some trimming required in the hinge area.  Version 1.0 has been modified in this hinge area to print more cleanly, and has a slightly thinner motor mount, to help motors with shorter shafts make good connections to the gears."
