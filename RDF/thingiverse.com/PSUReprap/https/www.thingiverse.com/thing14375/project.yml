function: "These are arms to hold a filament spindle specifically designed for the Mendel frame. It has been designed to be tough to handle heavy spindles, and it can fold down into the machine for easy transportation without disassemble.\r\n\r\nTotal number of printed parts: 4\r\nOther hardware: 3 pieces of 5/16-inch all-thread cut to lengths appropriate for machine, 8 nuts for all-thread, 9 washers for all-thread, and two M3x2-cm bolts or similar standard bolts.\r\n\r\nThe parts can be printed with sparse layers and still be more than strong enough to hold heavy spindles."
