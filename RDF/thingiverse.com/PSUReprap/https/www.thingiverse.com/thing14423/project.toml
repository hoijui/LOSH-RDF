function = "This spool arm design uses a minimal amount of printed plastic, but still has the strength to support a spool. The key is the metal rods that are screwed through the base and the clip, which are stronger, but still inexpensive. \r\n\r\nThe spool arm quickly rotates down for mobility and takes up no additional space while being transported."
