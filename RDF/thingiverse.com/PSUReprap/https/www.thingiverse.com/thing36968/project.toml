function = "Combination of the Greg's Accessible Extruder and Wade's Extruder.  Easily bolts on to the Open X Carriage. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21276\r\n\r\nThis extruder design combines the very cool design improvements by GregFrost with a wades-esque body, which allows the stepper motor to be slid into place so that gears of various size will still work.\r\n\r\nThe extruder drive gear has been redesigned so that the stem is slightly shorter, making it compatable with both Greg's and Wade's style extruders. The captive nut is placed closer to the top of the print to make it easy to slip it in as soon as it's done. \r\n\r\nThe driven gear is designed to be both sturdy as well as resistant to warp due to not being a completely solid piece."
