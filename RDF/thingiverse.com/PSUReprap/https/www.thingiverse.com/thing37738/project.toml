function = "This is a herringbone drive gear that has been modified to have a beveled edge.  This bevel allows for better prints of the drive gear because its first layer is circular creating an accurate print from the start.  This circle rids the gear design of the original 'star' shape in the first layer, making the part more accurate and repeatable."
