\r
Printed Linear rails and shuttles riders\r
Printed threaded rods\r
Use of dovetails for connectors\r
\r
This axis would be perfect for use EXCEPT the threaded rod is too wobbly, binds a bit too much, and was difficult to align. Could I use a metal threaded rod? Of course, however I consider that a failure of design. My ultimate goal is to remove ALL non-printable parts from the design.\r
\r
I'm going to start working on my 9th version now, which greatly reduces printed parts and adds stability, Feel free to cannibalize any parts you see here. You may need to change around some paths in the scad file to get it to compile.\r
