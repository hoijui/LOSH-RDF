function = "Shown here is a study of the basic design for the PrintrBot. After analyzing the PrintrBot flicker stream, it was apparent that several versions were present. I picked and chose several design elements from multiple models and created an amalgamation shown here. Do not expect this to be an exact copy.\r\n\r\nIncluded is the SCAD file for manipulation. Pay attention to the notes and comments when making changes.\r\n\r\nI make no guarantee about the functionality or printablilty of parts. In order to make a functioning PrintrBot clone, you will also need the following parts:\r\n\r\n8mm threaded rod\r\n8mm rail\r\nlmu88 (a bunch)\r\nextruder, steppers, controller,etc...\r\n\r\nand here are some additional printed parts you will need:\r\n\r\nIdler Pulley for XAxis : \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3970 - whosiswhatsis\r\n\r\nTiming Belt Pulley for X / Y Axis: \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1362 - Erik\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2079 - NopHead\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6604 - makeme\r\n\r\n5mm to 8mm shaft couplers:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11708 - Petehagoras\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10906 - raldrich\r\n\r\nAdditionally, The Y-pulley idlers need to be designed to provide tension of the y-belt to the Y-Motor.\r\n\r\nFeel free to provide some constructive criticisms. If you make changes to a part, please send them to me.\r\n-PMF"
