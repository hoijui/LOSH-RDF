function: "Shown here is a generic printed axis. I designed and printed this one today to be the Z-axis for a Stereolithographic UV 3d printer I'm making. I will upload more progress about the printer as I make it. This axis seems to work well enough. I used 3/8\" steel rods and bushings, because that's what I had laying around. I also used 1/4\" 20tpi threaded rod. The SCAD file is generic, so you can change a few variables to make it 1/4 - 8mm rod compatible. I also used piece of plywood as a base.\r\nI built the axis to be 300mm overall length, you can choose any length you'd like. I would recommend using an lm8uu or equivalent for your rod diameter instead of bushings. When you change to lm8uu's or other, you'll need to adjust the slider to fit."
