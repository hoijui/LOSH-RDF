function = "I have made a bunch of improvements in this design, and I would consider it my first real \"success\".\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n1) I changed the pressure angled of the V-groove from 45 to 22.5 so the v-groove bearing are easier to print.\r\n2) many modifications to the shuttle and added in adjustment screws, slide tracks, etc for mounting\r\n3) changes to the bearing system, I'm now using 608 bearings with a v-groove sleeve.\r\n4) changed the height of the tube, the herrringbone track is now printed separately and inlaid into the track space.\r\n\r\nMy to-do list includes:\r\n-More shuttle modifications\r\n-Mods to the motor mount\r\n-Cleaning up code\r\n-Usage of parametric printed bearings\r\n-get rid of all nuts and bolts and replace with printed materials"
