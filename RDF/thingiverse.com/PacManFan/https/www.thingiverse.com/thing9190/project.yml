function: "This is the 5th version of my printable linear rail, I've gotten everything to finally work correctly. This can be used as a drop in replacement for a 3d printer's X or Y axis. It's rail system is designed to connect together to form any needed length.  \n\nThis machine hopefully will be my entry for the Gada prize.  \n\n\nUpdate 06/16/2011:  \nI worked out a few modifications to the shuttle. Now the lower half of the shuttle can be printed as well, this removes:  \n4x 5/16(8mm) nuts  \n2x 5/16(8mm) bolts  \n2x 5/16 washers  \n\n-The next to go is going to be replacing the front 5/16(8mm) hardware with all printed parts. I'm trying to pare this down just the motor and the printed parts.  \n\n-I also redesigned the Large helical gear to incorporate the 608 bearing embedded inside of it.  think this is an advantage of trying to use 2 bearings in the pillow block. The large helical gear is also now held in place by a printed 8mm bolt 40mm long. This removes one additional piece of hardware.  \n\n-The shuttle top now has 4 mounting holes, although I'm just securing the motor with 2 at this point.  \n\n-I printed 2 new 3-segment rails, redesigned lower half of shuttle to be printed.   \n-I also added 2 new pics of the x/y gantry system and uploaded all new parts - I should have another video.  \n\nUpdate 04/30/2013  \nIt's been brought to my attention that the rack file was missing from this. I have uploaded both the rack stl and scad file. Enjoy!  \n\nHere is a youtube video of it in action:  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScJMPw6UPtw  \n\nComments and feedback are welcome."
