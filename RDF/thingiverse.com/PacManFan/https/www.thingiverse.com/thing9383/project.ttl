    okh:function """This is a small 200m test print of some threaded rod I made along with a matching nut. It is a double helix with 1 turn per 50mm. The math works out like this:\r
\r
For a standard 200 step/ rev stepper motor\r
50mm / 200 step = .25mm per step\r
add in a 2:1 gearing or half step motor controller and you have .125 mm/step\r
add both and it's .0625 mm/step\r
\r
From what i can tell, there is no perceptible backlash and the nut slides very freely. \r
\r
I'm sure I'm going to incorporate this into my shuttle system or a printer somehow. \r
Enjoy...\r
\r
Edit: \r
As per request, Here's a video of it:\r
\r
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkjf8x__SrE\r
The video shows that it's loose enough to slip down on it's own. \r
I would recommend printing one to test tolerances for yourself.\r

Uploaded the quad helical nut/thread. This should help with any wear issues, as well as addressing any concerns with backlash.""" ;
