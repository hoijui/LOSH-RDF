function: "This is a small 200m test print of some threaded rod I made along with a matching nut. It is a double helix with 1 turn per 50mm. The math works out like this:\r\n\r\nFor a standard 200 step/ rev stepper motor\r\n50mm / 200 step = .25mm per step\r\nadd in a 2:1 gearing or half step motor controller and you have .125 mm/step\r\nadd both and it's .0625 mm/step\r\n\r\nFrom what i can tell, there is no perceptible backlash and the nut slides very freely. \r\n\r\nI'm sure I'm going to incorporate this into my shuttle system or a printer somehow. \r\nEnjoy...\r\n\r\nEdit: \r\nAs per request, Here's a video of it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkjf8x__SrE\r\nThe video shows that it's loose enough to slip down on it's own. \r\nI would recommend printing one to test tolerances for yourself.\r\n\r\nEdit 6/18/2011\r\nUploaded the quad helical nut/thread. This should help with any wear issues, as well as addressing any concerns with backlash."
