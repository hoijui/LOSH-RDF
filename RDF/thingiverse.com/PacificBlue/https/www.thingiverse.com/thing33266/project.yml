function: Thin Footswitch is designed to trigger the scary props in your front yard on Halloween when Trick or Treat'ers pass by. You'll need some aluminum foil, a bit of double-stick tape, and the connector off the other end of the wire from the "Try Me" button on the box the animated prop came in. It's 144mm square & 5mm thin, small enough to print on most 3D printers. Print it half-black to hide it, half-bright so you can't miss it, or print one side in flourescent filament so it glows under blacklight, use your imagination!
