function: "Mini Tripod is a derivative of Daid's Tiny Tripod, plus I added printable legs. The platform is deeper to accomodate the ABS legs & strong enough to support slightly heavier cameras w/o falling over like my Polaroid Instant. You can SuperGlue the legs if you want more rigidity.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't tilt but it's perfect for setting a small security camera on a window sill, or if you're a digital camera buff you can print a bunch of these to display your collection on your bookshelf. Uhm, anyone up for some Bullet Time\xC2\xAE?\r\n\r\nHere's Daid's Tiny Tripod: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24253"
