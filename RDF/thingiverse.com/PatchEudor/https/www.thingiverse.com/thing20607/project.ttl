In a DEFCON first I bring you the leaked DEFCON 20 badge.  It's gone old school simple for this two decade milestone, harkening back to its roots.  While this is the single extruder file, I have it on good authority there's a dual extruder version where one of the extruders is loaded with some experimental conductive PLA which will be used to drive embedded circuits placed on the badges while printing!\r

Oh, and remember, mind the date.""" ;
