function = "This is a design for making modualer plexiglass (acrylic) display cabinets. Each piece is 2\"x2\"x1/2\". The Idea is to simply print out eight of these bad boys and insert 1/4\" Acrylic into the slots to form a cube... then to add more selfs print out more pieces as needed... I don't have a working printer right now so if some one feels like printin some out and trying it just let me know! thanks for looking!\r\n\r\nI will up load sketchs and maybe even a smaller version when i get a chance."
