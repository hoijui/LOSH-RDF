function = "Remember Spirograph? Now available in 3d!\r\n\r\nClassic spirograph involves rotating one cog around the inside or outside of another fixed cog. A pen is used through a hole in the rotating cog to trace out a spirograph pattern.\r\n\r\nThe spirograph vase extends this to the third dimension by extruding and twisting the spirograph pattern.\r\n\r\nThe parameters describing the \"rotating cog\" radius, \"fixed cog\" radius and distance of the \"pen\" determine the shape and pattern of the walls of the vase - which can take on many forms. You can then twist the resulting pattern and raise to whatever height you require."
