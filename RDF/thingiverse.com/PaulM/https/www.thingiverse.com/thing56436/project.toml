function = "A flexible, tactile, customisable bracelet which makes a pleasant jingly, rattly noise.  \n\nThe bracelet is made from a number of interlocking segments made from concentric cylinders. One openable segment can be included to allow the bracelet to be fastened when on the wrist so you don't need to oversize it to go over your hand.  \n\nSuperseeded by this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:57780 which is more comfortable to wear."
