function: Addon piece for a Printrbot (www.thingiverse.com/thing:16990) that sits between the extruder and extruder mount to attach a 40mm fan. It should work with the printed or laser cut versions. I don't have mine assembled yet, but others have said it works. I'll probably revise the mount once I get my bot printing and can see what can be improved.
