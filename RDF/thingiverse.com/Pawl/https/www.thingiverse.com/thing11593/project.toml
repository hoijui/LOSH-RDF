function = "A small modification of ScribbleJ's excellent Z Rod Constraint which adds a flat surface to mount a mechanical switch endstop.\r\n\r\nI didn't have enough room for both a Z Rod Constraint and an endstop holder on the bottom of my left Z-Rod, so I combined them.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I printed it out and it didn't quite fit, so I extended the endstop holder. Also, I added the sketchup files as requested."
