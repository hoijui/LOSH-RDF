function: "This design is for a Printrbot with  threaded rods at the base,  Y and X smooth rods, and a  sq. heated bed. The design is ~10.5 in. by ~13 in.\r\n\r\nThere's also a design that is made up of 4 pieces which attach together with 8 short #6 bolts.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 pairs of 2 holes for the belt clamps.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 holes closest to the middle for mounting a  x  heated build plate.\r\n\r\nThe 4 holes closest to the outside are for the Y Bar Clamps.\r\n\r\n02/17 Update: Made the Y-bar holes wider to allow for some slop in the distance between each of the bases.\r\n\r\n02/19 Update: Corrected position of the belt clamps. The belt clamp needed to line up with the edge of the 608 bearings.\r\n\r\n02/21 Update: Added length. Hot end doesn't line up with x smooth rods, so there needs to be extra length on the right or left side of the print bed. Also made the holes wider for #6 bolts.\r\n\r\n03/01 update: adjusted position of belt clamps \r\n\r\n03/09 update: rounded edges slightly\r\n\r\n05/01 update: attached a design for a 4 piece print bed, because the laser cutter I have access to can't cut the 13+ inch original design\r\n\r\nI'm planning to remove nearly all the material in the center of the plate (to reduce weight/momentum/wobble)."
