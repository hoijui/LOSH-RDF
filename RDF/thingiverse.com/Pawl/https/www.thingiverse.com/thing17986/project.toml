function = "This is a concept part which adds some features to the original printrbot x-motor mount. (It's based on the V2 release of the printrbot motor mount.)\r\n\r\nX-Motor Changes:\r\n\r\n*Z-Endstop Bolt Holder - the nut capture on the side will hold a nut for a long #6 (SAE) bolt which will trigger a mechanical endstop glued to the side of the z motor\r\n\r\n*Access To Bottom Two Motor Mount Bolts - Added slots to access the bottom two motor mounting bolts with an allen wrench.\r\n\r\n*Adjustable X Rods - Added nut captures for bolts to push the x smooth rods further apart, in case they are cut too short (this will cause leadscrew wobble if they are even 1mm too short). I think it's best to use a jig to adjust how far apart the bases are from eachother, then fine tune how far apart the x-rods are with this feature.\r\n\r\n*Thicker Nut Trap - Raised shoulder on the nut trap for the leadscrew according to droftarts's suggestion.\r\n\r\n*Adjusted Leadscrew Nut Chamber - The nut chamber is now the same size as the idler's. 8mm nuts should fit inside of it.\r\n\r\nX-Idler Changes:\r\n\r\n*Thicker Nut Trap - Same as x-motor mount.\r\n\r\n*Moved idler bolt up 5mm due to droftarts's suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: Woops, I moved the idler bolt down instead. Fixed.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2/24: Jsturm noticed the bottom hole from the x smooth rod did not line up exactly (off by I think .1mm) between the idler and the motor. Fixed\r\n\r\nUpdate 2/25: Jsturm also noticed an issue with Brook's nut chamber for the leadscrew-nut. It was a different size on both of the x-ends. He also noticed an 8mm nut fit in the idler, but not the motor mount's chamber. Fixed by copying the leadscrew-nut chamber to the x-motor mount."
