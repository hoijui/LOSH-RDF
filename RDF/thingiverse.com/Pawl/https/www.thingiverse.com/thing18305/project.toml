function = "This mounting bracket is a derivative of Lulzbot's printed mounting bracket for their acrylic electronics mount plate. \r\n\r\nWith this mounting bracket, half as many vitamins are necessary for mounting the acrylic plate. Also, it has a nut capture for easier assembly.\r\n\r\nThis design is also partially based on Brook's Printrbot y-bar mounts."
