function = "This base prevents the motor from bending at an angle toward the base. The motor will try to angle outward due to the weight on the motor and the base's lack of support. \r\n\r\nThis part attempts to resolve the problem by adding a 2.3mm wide lip so the motor has nowhere to move. \r\n\r\nA 2.3mm lip should work with all nema 17 motors, and I know for sure it should work with the ones Lulzbot and Ultimachine sells."
