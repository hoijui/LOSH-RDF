function = "This shelf has 20 3\"x3\" slots. It can be used for safety glasses in your shop. A lasercutter is required for this design.\r\n\r\nIt has a cover, you will need a hinge for it.\r\n\r\nIt is designed for 1/8\" material. So, it is probably best to use 3.2mm (1/8\") wood.\r\n\r\nPonoko charges $48 to make this."
