function = "This is a prototype animatronic tail, OpenScan designed 3D printed on a 3D printer and controlled by Arduino.\r\n\r\nThis is a small test:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1k9p1P4s8I\r\n\r\nI attached in a text document the code that use to control the servo with arduino.\r\n\r\nUses the number of vertebrae that want, i use 10 plus the final. I put a rubber cord in the side holes to keep the tail as, in the other holes, i put a normal string attached to the wheel. And so that the rope does not slip from the wheel put some small aluminum rings.\r\n\r\nI hope you like ;)"
