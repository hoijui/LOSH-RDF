function: "This is a new building block toy with a unique connectable system. This is designed for 3D pixel art and to rival Lego. This may even evolve into a building set for a popular video game that uses cubes to build structures. The main focus is minimal block types with unlimited potential.\r\n\r\nThis set includes, the base block, half block, quarter block, panel, C-Clip, L-Clip, T-Clip, and clear block. \r\nThe panel can be customized with printed stickers and interchangeable or stickers can be placed on the Base Block to be permanent. \r\nHalf Block and Quarter Block can be used in construction and as a base floor."
