function = "A simple cell phone stand that breaks down for traveling.  \nThe original fit a phone up to 1/2\" thick.  On a request i have added two more lower sections to accommodate larger phones.  .125\" & .25\" larger.  I uploaded medium and VERY high resolution parts so take your pic, look at the file sizes and download what you would like.  I am going to also upload the top section on VERY high res also for those of you who like real smooth prints as i do.  Hope everyone enjoys.  Let me know of any other good ideas for improvements!  :)"
