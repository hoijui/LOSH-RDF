function = "Elliptical gears and some connector links to play around with.  I got the idea for these when i was thinking about an old steam locomotive.  I have been playing with them for a couple weeks and wanted to upload something.  I may design some more connecting links and different shaped gears that go with this in the future.  I will upload them if i do."
