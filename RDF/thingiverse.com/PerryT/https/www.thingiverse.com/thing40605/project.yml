function: "This is a FULL size Traditional Staunton Chess set designed by 4dCadCam.com\r\nMy interpretation of one anyway!\r\nIncluding a Board.  The STL files are very high res which is why they are large.  Worth the download.  I experimented with lower res output and was not satisfied.  I like \"VERY Smooth\" surfaces. :)"
