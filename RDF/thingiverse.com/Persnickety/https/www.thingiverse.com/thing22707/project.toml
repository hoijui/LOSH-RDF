function = "This is a flat representation of the Philadelphia Flyers NHL hockey team logo. This is my first model, and I wanted to test my dual-extruders.\r\nThe proper logo is actually three colors, but I left the orange part out, so there is a nifty hole in the middle.\r\n\r\nI learned some things doing this:\r\n - the white border is too narrow, so the extruder didn't 'fill' between its sides.\r\n - my platform must not be level, because the left extruder scraped the surface of the model when the right extruder was working\r\n - I'd probably flip the whole model so that the shiny finish that comes from the platform would end up on the front of the model"
