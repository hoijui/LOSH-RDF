function: "I have to tune my Guitar quite often to Drop-D, and back to standard E. Due to a free swinging Floyd Rose Tremolo, the Tension changes with that, and all the other strings have to be adjused aswell, thats quite time consume, because every the tension lowering is kind of a chain reaction.\r\n\r\nThats what these Backboxes are for, they block the FR at the back, so it won't go down any further."
