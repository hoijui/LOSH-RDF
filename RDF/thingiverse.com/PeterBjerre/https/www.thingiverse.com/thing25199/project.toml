function = "I am having leveling problems with my heated bed, i am getting decent prints now but i could be better.\r\nI have designed a new Y-bar end to make my bed adjustable, my idea is to drill a bigger hole in the plywood to be able to fit a spring trough it. New longer 3mm screws will be needed. I will be trying this when i find som useable springs."
