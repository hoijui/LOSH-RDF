    okh:function """This is a simple Holder which I made to use my Zoom H1 Reccorder with my Camcorder (Panasonic SD707) and my DSLR (Canon 500D).\r
\r
It simply uses the Flashlight-mount on both of these cameras to be attached. The H1 has a standard screw-tread which can be found on almost any tripod, so you could use this very holder to attach other things than just the H1... (you might want to get crazy and attach a second camera to your SLR :D)\r
\r
The Position of the mic does not interfer with the 35mm Viewangle of the camcorder, there might be a problem if you intend to use a wideangle-adapter.\r
\r
To reccord i simply attach the Linout of the H1 to the LineIn on my camcorder.\r
\r
For the DSLR, I simply lay the Audio over the Video after reccording as the 500D unfortunatly does not have a LineIn (Only Mono-Sound *eeeek*).\r
\r
The soundquality with the H1 is way better as the mic is able to reccord uncompressed 24bit 96khz .wav files.""" ;
