A complete bearing uses 88 balls.\r\n\r\nThe different pieces are drawn in google sketchup but the boolean operations are made with blender after a conversion to .stl\r\n\r\nThe \"springs\" put some pressure on the bearing and compensate an eventual wear.\r\nThe spikes in the spring fit inside small holes printed on the bearing.\r\n\r\nIt's a part of my current project, a self replicable 3D printer/mill/PCB engraver, each axis will be equipped with 4 of these bearings.\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nDesign update with captive M4 nuts\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\n2nd Design update : track improvement (larger on the outside) must be printed with 0.2mm layer height and W/T=2 because of the thiner outside wall"
