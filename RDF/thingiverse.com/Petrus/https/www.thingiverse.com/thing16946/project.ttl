\r
The balls are 1/8" (3.175mm) steel balls I salvaged from old bikes when I was a kid, we can source them in bike parts stores. A complete bearing uses 88 balls.\r
\r
The different pieces are drawn in google sketchup but the boolean operations are made with blender after a conversion to .stl\r
\r
The "springs" put some pressure on the bearing and compensate an eventual wear.\r
The spikes in the spring fit inside small holes printed on the bearing.\r
\r
It's a part of my current project, a self replicable 3D printer/mill/PCB engraver, each axis will be equipped with 4 of these bearings.\r

2nd Design update : track improvement (larger on the outside) must be printed with 0.2mm layer height and W/T=2 because of the thiner outside wall""" ;
