function = "The design is inspired by the triangular frame of the reprap Mendel, It will be heavier and more rigid to be able to mill plastic, engrave circuit board and print at high speed.\r\n\r\nDifferences compared to the standard Mendel :\r\n- vertical X axis to quickly change the tool (extruder or spindle)\r\n- M10 and M12 threaded rods instead of M8 for better frame stiffness\r\n- 10mm smooth rods instead of 8mm for better axis stiffness\r\n- Precision doubling belt configuration inspired by Madkite's design : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8852\r\n- nema23 steppers for the X and Y axis instead of nema17\r\n- Each axis will be equipped with 4 printed linear bearings : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16946\r\n\r\nI will also try to use steel cables instead of timed belts for X and Y axis.\r\n\r\nAll parts are printed with 0.2mm layer height.\r\n\r\nWork in progress.\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nI've uploaded the different parts on several \"things\" for more clarity :\r\nMain/Frame : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19368\r\nX Axis : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25975\r\nY Axis : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25976\r\nZ Axis : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25978\r\nLinear bearing : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16946"
