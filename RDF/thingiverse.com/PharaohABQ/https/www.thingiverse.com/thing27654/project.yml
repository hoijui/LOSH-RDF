function: "This is a new Extruder with TWO hobbed bolts for extrusion.  Two bolts means this is almost unstrippable. You should get fewer Jams and allow more pressure for smaller printheads.\r\n\r\nI'm calling this Wades Collaborative Extruder because so many people have added so many great things to the Wades, Without all of you this would not be possible."
