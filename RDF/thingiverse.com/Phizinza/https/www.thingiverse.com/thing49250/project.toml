function = "I saw JBFromOz's spool holder but wanted something a little different and designed this. \r\nThe arms click in simply, but it needs to be printed at an angle on the bed one arm at a time to fit. I had no trouble with warping on glass with ABS Juice.\r\nThe spool holder arms allow for 260mm diameter spools.\r\n\r\nThe spool spindles are designed to take spools with holes from 24 to 40mm diameter. They can be fitted with a standard 608 bearing (most commonly a skate bearing). \r\n\r\nHardware needed,\r\n8mm threaded rod\r\nA few 8mm nuts\r\nAdditionally: 2 x 608 bearings."
