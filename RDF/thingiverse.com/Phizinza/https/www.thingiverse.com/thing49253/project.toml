function = "I saw a few around and modeled one on richgain's version.   \nIt's two parts, the duct and the bracket. You might need a different bracket as this one is made for a Greg's extruder. But if gives 16mm or so of adjustability in height for different hot ends.  \n\nNOTE: I have been told this will not work with Prusa V2, refer to the comments.  \n\nInside I have ducted about 30% of the air to the side the fan is on and the other 70% around the revolve to blow from the other directions.   \n\nI based it on a 60mm fan because that's what I had on hand."
