function = "After looking on Ebay and seeing people sell rectangular pieces of wood to be used as Doll House roof shingles, I decided to be a little more efficient.\r\n\r\nInstead of manually gluing each individual shingle and paying an arm and a leg for a bag of wood chips, I created a 3D model in CorelDraw that can be laser engraved to create a 3D surface.\r\n\r\nThis SVG file is just a small portion, you can resize it, copy / paste, etc... Until you reach your desired size.\r\n\r\nThis was created using the contour tool in CorelDraw to create a 3D gray scale height map that the laser can interpret."
