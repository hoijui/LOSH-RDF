\r
In traditional Japanese architecture, a Shoji is a door, window or room divider consisting of translucent paper over a frame of wood which holds together a sort of grid of wood or bamboo. (Shoji, 2009)\r
\r
Shoji doors are often designed to slide open, and thus conserve space that would be required by a swinging door. They are used in traditional houses as well as Western-style housing, especially in the washitsu (Japanese-style room). (Shoji, 2009)\r
\r
Phoenix Laser Engraving creates these beautiful Shoji Shadow Boxs from Birch Plywood, and we hand glue the paper to the inside to provide an elegant item.\r
\r
These special Shoji Shadow Boxes are made for Bedside Tables, Romantic Nights, Cubical Desks, and hanging. The subtle light sets the mood and catches attention. The candle inside is battery operated so no worries.\r
