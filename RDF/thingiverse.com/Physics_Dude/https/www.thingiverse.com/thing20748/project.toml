function = "I found this fantastic model of a (low poly) fennec fox on the Google 3D Warehouse http://goo.gl/z5YFi by user Xaya. \r\nThe design prints superbly without any alterations and it was exported to STL format via Google Sketchup.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I made a plated version of this fox some time ago and found it to produce much cleaner results due to the lack of overhangs. This is especially useful when printing at a larger scale. \r\n\r\nOriginal model by Google 3D Warehouse user zt2fan, significant improvements to model done by user Xaya.
