function: "Derived from drdpj's 12cm outer-edge fan mount (for 25mm deep fans), this version is designed for the often much more powerful 38mm deep fans.  \r\nA lot of these larger fans can spit out a massive amount of air, and with that, only one is required in most cases. The one I use is a 225DS-1LP13 manufactured by Etri.  \r\n**Update:** Version 2 (fan_mount_38_2.stl) now has longer nibs to better grip the holes on the fan.  \r\n**Update:** I've added an optional XL version (fan_mount_40_2_XL.stl) which is about 3mm wider to accommodate and secure optional fan guards or shrouds."
