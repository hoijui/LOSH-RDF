function: "Derivative ha ha i wish no these are just some mini plates that can be printed on a small footprint printer 100x100mm. So that i could print them on a Thing o Matic (with ABP or with HBP)\r\n\r\nThis was all done with openscad and quite a bit of work ;-) so maybe it will help someone.\r\n\r\n!!!! I have included all de parts of the huxley because a moved them around a bit (some of them where of center) so if you are using the openscad file please use these. !!!"
