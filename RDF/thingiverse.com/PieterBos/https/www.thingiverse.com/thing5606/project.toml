function = "I needed a laser mount for a line laser (building a 3d laser scanner). This laser can be focused but for that you need to be able to move the hole thing and the focus ring.\r\nThat's why a added the nut and bold hole at the top of the thing.\r\n\r\nI plan to add more stuff to it but it is usable as it is\r\n\r\nUpdate 2011-01-22:\r\nI wanted to be able to turn the laser when its mounted  so a made a cap for it that will slide over the top op the mount. I also made an version that will mount nicely on my meccano. With a little help from this great lib http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2873 by Erik http://www.thingiverse.com/Erik\r\n\r\nThe caps work but i am not really happy with them. The thing is getting to big and i also need to put a bolt in the side of the cap to keep it in its position (not showing on the foto's).\r\n\r\nBut i though i would share them anyway\r\n\r\nI will makeing a new small mount that will be even more simpler ;-)"
