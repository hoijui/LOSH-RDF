    okh:function """Laser mount version 1 was fine but it would be nice to have a easy way of rotating it (the cap was a bit overkill). The solution was simple just print a hole through the holder. leaving enough roam for the bolt head or screw. Then you easily bolt it to whatever you like. \r
\r
This version has a hole for a diameter of 12 mm laser but the hole is a bit bigger now so it fits a bit better\r
\r
I am using the M3 nuts and bolds from my makerbot set btw.\r
\r
Also include a image of my old laser mount having a 3d printer makes my life soo much better. O and and a shot of my primitive build of a 3d scanner with the new mount ;-).""" ;
