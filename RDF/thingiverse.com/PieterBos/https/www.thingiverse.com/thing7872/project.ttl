\r
I am making a head scanner and will add the bits and pieces to this thing while i am making it. Things will change!!!\r
\r
This thing will have an camera mounted to it and will drive around the object that I want to scan (a head for example :) . A a am using a BÃ¼hler motor to drive it but maybe i will use a stepper instead. Thats why i made it this way so i could slide different type of motor holders in my setup.\r
\r
The print of the motor holder (part2_closed.stl) took 2 hours to print and has to bridge a insane gap (do not try this without a stepper extruder ;-)\r
\r
I added the slide in holder as separate stl's because the may be of use to someone (also included as scad files in the archive.zip)\r
\r
