function: "Well this is an proof of concept so to speak. Not really a thing ;-). What i do here is generate scad files. I was playing with that thought for a while now. Because its a bit strange. I use one programming language (action-script 3.0 and flex in my case)  to generate the other. \r\n\r\nIn this case for the polygon method within openscad witch is powerfull but hard to read. So a made the visual helper for generation polygon call with a bit of extrusion\r\n\r\nWeird but it works what do you think mad or mad science ;)\r\n\r\nThe small air app does not have any undo functionality and you can only draw on a grid, it was just to test something maybe i will add stuff to it ? should i ?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oSW9zlKsZ8\r\n\r\nUpdate 14 Jun 2011:\r\nThanks for the great response but a bit of warning is in place the fxp source code is, well.. how do is say it.... very sloppy ;-) , just so you know build it 2 or 3 hours or so ( hack hack )\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 13 Aug 2011:\r\nStill working on it but not ready for its first release :-(\r\nSome hints\r\n- Layers (one layer is one openscad module) each layer its own color \r\n- Adding and Deleting of Points and of course Moving points  Splitting of segments\r\n- Curves (Maybe)\r\n- Save files (some json or xml) so you can save your work\r\n- Web based and AIR app\r\n- Etc Etc ;-)\r\n\r\nUpdate 2 Aug 2012 :\r\nNew version at\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13348\r\nOr\r\nhttp://www.protorabbit.nl/?p=32"
