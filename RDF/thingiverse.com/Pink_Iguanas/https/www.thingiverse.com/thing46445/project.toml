function = "A hinged, detailed, and awesome looking design, this model of GLaDOS will look great in any Portal fan's house with its display hook and led slot for GLaDOS's \"eye\". You can choose between the Portal 1 model of GLaDOS and the Portal 2 model of GLaDOS for the head. Wheatley is completely compatible with the model. Wheatley sports two functioning handles that can be removed to give him a post Chapter 5 look. He will also soon have a slot for an LED, but currently is only just ready to fit onto GLaDOS, although he fits perfectly. Every core from both games is compatible with the pegs of the body and base. This model includes The Morality Core, The Curiosity Core, The Intelligence Core, The Anger Core, The Space Core, Rick, and The Fact Core."
