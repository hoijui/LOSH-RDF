function = "This gravity gun (from half life)is accurate (as much as I could make it) and just all around awesome looking. It is sliced into multiple pieces, to make printing easier, and so that it can be as close to 1:1 scale it can be, and I am now proud to say that it is, in fact, 1:1 scale. SImilar to pleppik's portal gun, this is a gargantuan project, and will take a while, if you are brave enough to try. Enjoy."
