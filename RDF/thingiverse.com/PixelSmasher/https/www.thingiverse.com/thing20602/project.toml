Who would have ever immagined such a fun program being able to run through a web browser? Booleans work more predictable than the ones in 3dsmax too! XD I totaly recomend this to anyone whos a beginner, or even an advanced user. You would be surprised at what you can get done, and it can only get better as they make updates."
