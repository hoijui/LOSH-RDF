    okh:function """Replacement Hand Crank for a "B&D Workmate" early model.  \r
My workmate was bought in the 1980's and is almost 100% metal with a wood top. It is similar to the Black & Decker 21321 model or WM425.  The swivel-clamp-pegs and the hand cranks are plastic.  \r
One of my hand cranks broke and epoxy didn't fix it so I took the measurements and designed a replacement.\r
\r
The replacement I designed now has a double handle but it's easy to delete the second crank from the OpenScad file if you want it more like the original.  I believe the double crank will give better leverage to really tighten the clamp and loosen it again.\r
\r
I also thickened up the crank and head quite a bit, and added some reinforcement since a printed part isn't as durable as a molded part.  The critical dimensions should be the same. The angles are changed to make it easier to print but that shouldn't matter much.""" ;
