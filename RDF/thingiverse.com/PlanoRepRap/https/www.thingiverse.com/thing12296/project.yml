function: "Nema23 Z axis for regular Prusa Mendel. \r\n2 required\r\nIntegrated Vertex and rod Clamp\r\n\r\nI have some surplus/salvage Nema23 steppers that are a little too underpowered for CNC but should work fine for Prusa.  I can replace 2 Nema17 steppers on my Prusa freeing them up for extruder and x-carriage on a new one.\r\n\r\nThe motor should not be bolted down hard as this would cause more problems if the toolhead impacts the print(or the bed!) and allows for a little wiggle just like Prusa's original design.\r\n\r\nI used the vertex profile, so measuring and tightening the frame remains the same. Edit your frame-vertex.scad file so it doesn't produce a shape by default. I include the one I use, so edited, it's from the Prusa Felt Branch.\r\n\r\nNotice that the motor does cross the top of the z-smooth-rod.  Position the smooth rod so that it doesn't quite touch the motor.  This was a compromise so that spacing between the motor shaft and the smooth rod is \"Standard\" -- the same as with a nema 17 design.\r\n\r\nStill working on a printed coupler. But any Nema23 to 8mm coupler should work."
