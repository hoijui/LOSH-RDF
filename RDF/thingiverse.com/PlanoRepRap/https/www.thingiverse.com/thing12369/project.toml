function = "This \"Thingy\" makes a 20mm diameter wire clip or a wire conduit.  The flexible outside easily opens and clips over the Mendel rod then it snaps tight onto the 8mm or 5/16 rod.   The wires are pushed inside and the outside is then compressed so the barb clips/snaps into the grove to lock the conduit.\r\nThe clip can be repeatedly snapped and unsnapped to route and reroute wire.\r\n\r\nIt can also be removed and used again somewhere else."
