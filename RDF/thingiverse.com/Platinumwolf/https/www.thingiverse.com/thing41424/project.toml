function = "This is the 4th redesign of my cubicle coat hook. It is designed to rest on top of a cubicle which is approximately 25mm thick at the top with slightly poofy walls - almost like a pillow top mattress. It has a tab which is intended to slide underneath the fabric side which is intended to help minimize the likelihood of an object coming off the cubicle wall when grabbing your jacket."
