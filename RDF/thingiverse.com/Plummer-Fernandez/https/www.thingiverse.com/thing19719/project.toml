function = "Tea cups designed with a 3D Scanning + a coded parametric manipulation approach developed at the Generator.x 3.0 workshop; an openLAB Masterclass with Marius Watz, organized at iMAL, Brussels.\r\nimal.org/wikimal/workshop/generatorx-30-code-atoms\r\n\r\nI'm exploring the possibilities of 'object sampling'; much like sampling in music, real objects can be sampled using 3D scanning, and then 'remixed' into new shapes and sizes. I use hypr3d.com to create 3D scans from photographs. For the remixing I've had to develop my own 3D interface in Processing that allows me to first upload the scan/mesh stl file, then parametrically distort, twist, stretch, bloat, or smooth the mesh. The app also adds thickness and crops the mesh ready for 3D printing. \r\n\r\n\r\nwww.plummerfernandez.com/tSet"
