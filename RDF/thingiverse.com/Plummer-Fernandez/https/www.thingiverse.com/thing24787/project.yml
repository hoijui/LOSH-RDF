function: "Objects created from the remix project 'We Met Heads On' https://vimeo.com/43848831\r\n\r\nMade with Processing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe video titled 'We Met Heads On' is my remix of the 3D scan hackathon at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY organised by Makerbot. The public were invited to scan artifacts to then modify and 3d print derivatives. I found 'decimation study - met heads' by scotta3d which is a derivative from another thingiverse user tbuser, and to continue the lineage of derivatives, I have placed the low-polygon heads from scotta3d into a Processing sketch that distorts the meshes in realtime in response to sound and outputs the modified stl objects. The soundwave is analysed from the streaming audio and used to force the mesh to twist to the strength of the soundwave. Performed and recorded in real-time.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.plummerfernandez.com/\r\nhttps://twitter.com/M_PF"
