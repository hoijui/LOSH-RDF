function = "A library of Tortuous Tortures all derived from the original torture test by MAKE. Some of these are currently impossible to print, or at least very challenging, so they should serve as a benchmark for the development of 3D printing as a technology. They are also in response to the growing culture of 3D printing - the Pokemon effect of wanting to make and complete collections, and the perpetual race (and disappointment) of printing quality."
