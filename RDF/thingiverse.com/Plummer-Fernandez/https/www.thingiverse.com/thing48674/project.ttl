Some of these are currently impossible to print, or at least very challenging, so they should serve as a benchmark for the development of 3D printing as a technology. They are also in response to the growing culture of 3D printing - the Pokemon effect of wanting to make and complete collections, and the perpetual race (and disappointment) of printing quality." ;
