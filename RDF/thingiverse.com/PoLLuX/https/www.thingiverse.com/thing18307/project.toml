function = "This is one of my monsters pets for the 3DArtist Mag and ThingIverse competition.\r\n\r\nSince I don't have no experience at all with 3D printing I decided to make my monster pet all in separate pieces and with very low detail.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this will workout good in the end, but I had to give it a go in this contest.\r\n\r\nFeel free to post your opinion, that will help me out to improve myself in the 3D printing area.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nMiguel Redondo"
