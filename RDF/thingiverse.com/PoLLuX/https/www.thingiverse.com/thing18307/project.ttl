\r
Since I don't have no experience at all with 3D printing I decided to make my monster pet all in separate pieces and with very low detail.\r
\r
Not sure if this will workout good in the end, but I had to give it a go in this contest.\r
\r
Feel free to post your opinion, that will help me out to improve myself in the 3D printing area.\r
\r
Thanks in advance,\r
