function = "Another Monster Pet I decided to create. \r\n\r\nIn this one I made it in a single piece with two versions, a Medium Poly and a High poly one since I'm not sure which one is the best for 3d printing.\r\n\r\nI modelled a support for it aswell, but it is optional, so there is no attachment to join both (glue them together)\r\n\r\nAny feedback will be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nMiguel Redondo"
