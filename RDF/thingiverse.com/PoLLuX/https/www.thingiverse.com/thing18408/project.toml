It can be used to store small objects or even pens and pencils.\r\n\r\nThe detail is not very high since my Zbrush skills are still getting improved and besides that I wasn't sure what kind of detail can be printed in the MakerBot Thing-o-Matic in what concerns this contest.\r\n\r\nThis model contains a support, that is optional (considering if you want to use it to store stuff or not)\r\n\r\nAny feedback is aprecciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nMiguel Redondo"
