function = "This Monster Pet is called Goodevil and I guess the name says it all.\r\n\r\nIn this one I tried to make it simple, again because I'm not sure what kind of detail will can be printed since my experience in 3D printing is non existent. \r\n\r\nGoodevil has two parts, the body of the pet and the a halo that can be attached to a small hole on the back of the head of the Good one.\r\n\r\nAny critic will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nMiguel Redondo"
