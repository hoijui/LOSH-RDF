function = "This is a standard leather bracelet template. Included are three files for different wrist sizes. They are in SVG format for easy adaptation to a laser cutter.\r\n\r\nHoles for snaps are for standard \"Glove\" sized snaps. I got mine at Tandy Leather for about $4 for a set that will do 10 bracelets. \r\n\r\nSnaps are set up so that the side closest to you when you wear the bracelet will be flat on your wrist. The other side will be slightly raised as it snaps into the snap sitting on your wrist. If you prefer, you can change this by flipping the template horizontally."
