Similar to the Weighted Storage Cube, the Companion Cube possesses a different design in Portal 2. The Cube functions in the same way as a Weighted Storage Cube, being differentiated to encourage test subjects to feel attached to the Cube.\r\n\r\n\"The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.\" \r\nâ€” GLaDOS\r\n\r\nThis Weighted Companion Cube is modelled from the Orange Box's Portal.\r\n\r\nÂ© 2007 Valve Corporation"
