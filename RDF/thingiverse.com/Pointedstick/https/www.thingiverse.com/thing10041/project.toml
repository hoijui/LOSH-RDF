function = "This is a clip-on holder for 5lb Ultimachine filament spools. It's designed to fit into one of the square holes on the top of your Makerbot Thing-O-Matic and hang off the back. No screws or hardware required! There's an indentation cut out just in case you have wires going through the hole you'd like to mount this on.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded the .lxo modo file."
