function: I loved the original design, but friction remained a problem for me and my spool wouldn't rotate freely. Turned out the spool's lips weren't quite straight. As a result, the width varied from 103 to 107 mm, and half of the time it would scrape against the sides. This modified version widens the spooler by a few millimeters while holding the bearings such that they can accomodate a spool of between 103 and 107 mm in width without the spool falling off. Also, I didn't see much need for the A-frame parts in the middle which just added some extra friction, so I removed them.
