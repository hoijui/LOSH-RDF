function: "Who likes time-lapse videos? I sure do. But what if have a Prusa Mendel and you've already made PrintTo3D's iPhone holder, but you don't have a tripod to attach your iPhone holder to, or don't want its bulk getting in the way? Clearly you need one that attaches directly to the frame of your machine!\r\n\r\nThis handy thing clips onto the threaded rods and holds the iPhone stand in place with one of tbuser's parametric pins (included below) that's 5.2 mm wide and 20 mm long.\r\n\r\nHere's a time lapse video I made with the help of this thing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soe5pg5IvGI"
