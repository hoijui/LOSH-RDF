function = "Real leadscrews are a great upgrade for RepRap printers because threaded rods can be bent, come with burrs, and really aren't designed for the kind of motion that they're used for. This Thing is a pair of X-ends that hold leadscrew nuts.  I've also redesigned the bearing column to simplify the design and properly support press-fit Igus bushings (which you can get at http://techpaladin.com), since they were really designed to fit into holes. If you find the holes too small to fit your bushings, you may need to ream or dremel them a bit.\r\n\r\nThe leadscrews and nuts that these X-ends are designed for can be ordered from Misumi.\r\n\r\nLeadscrew nuts: Misumi part number MTSKR8.\r\nLeadscrews: Misumi part number MTSR8-[length in millimeters]\r\n\r\nPrusa mendels require two units of MTSR8-200.\r\nMendelMax printers require two units of MTSR8-350 (360 if using the optional thrust bearing)\r\n\r\nI've uploaded the .scad files that I modified to make these parts. They may have additional dependencies, but you should be able to grab those from Josef Prusa's github at https://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel/tree/master/source\r\n\r\nIf you use Igus bushings, you may be interested in my Igus bushing-compatible Y-carriage bushing holders:\r\nthingiverse.com/thing:14593\r\n\r\nâ€¦And X-carriage:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14530\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 01/02/12: Re-uploaded files with more correct hole diameters and shallower pressure pads in the X rod tunnels to make push-fit assembly less likely to crack the parts."
