    okh:function """Real leadscrews are a great upgrade for RepRap printers because threaded rods can be bent, come with burrs, and really aren't designed for the kind of motion that they're used for. This Thing is a pair of X-ends that hold leadscrew nuts.  I've also redesigned the bearing column to simplify the design and properly support press-fit Igus bushings (which you can get at http://techpaladin.com), since they were really designed to fit into holes. If you find the holes too small to fit your bushings, you may need to ream or dremel them a bit.\r
\r
The leadscrews and nuts that these X-ends are designed for can be ordered from Misumi.\r
\r
Leadscrew nuts: Misumi part number MTSKR8.\r
Leadscrews: Misumi part number MTSR8-[length in millimeters]\r
\r
Prusa mendels require two units of MTSR8-200.\r
MendelMax printers require two units of MTSR8-350 (360 if using the optional thrust bearing)\r
\r
I've uploaded the .scad files that I modified to make these parts. They may have additional dependencies, but you should be able to grab those from Josef Prusa's github at https://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel/tree/master/source\r

Update 01/02/12: Re-uploaded files with more correct hole diameters and shallower pressure pads in the X rod tunnels to make push-fit assembly less likely to crack the parts.""" ;
