function = "This is a version of my leadscrew X-ends that accept self-aligning bronze bushings with a 16mm outer diameter at the flange and Misumi leadscrews. The bronze bushings fit very tightly to M8 rods, so make sure you're using high-quality precision rods; cheaper drill rod may bind.\r\n\r\nYou can get the bushings and leadscrews at http://techpaladin.com/\r\n\r\nIf you use these bushings, you may be interested in my compatible X-carriage: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16397\r\n\r\nUpdate:"
