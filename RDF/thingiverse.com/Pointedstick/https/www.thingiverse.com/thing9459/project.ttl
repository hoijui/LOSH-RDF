    okh:function "This device is a versatile dock for charging your iOS devices. iPads won't tip it over, and iPhones fit perfectly. Your 30-pin cable will be held in place by the channel in the bottom, an idea I brutally stole from Zaggo's iPhone dock. His thing is totally awesome, but it wouldn't fit my iPad as well, which is why I created this. The model was created in modo, and I've attached the original .lxo file." ;
