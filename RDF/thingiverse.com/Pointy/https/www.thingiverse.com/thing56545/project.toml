function = "OBSOLETE FOR NOW! Make : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:79303 Thanks @ Doxin for the edit!  \r\n\r\nThis is a pinky board for the R.A.T. 5 mouse. I love that mouse, however I was missing a place to rest my pinky. Now I saw that a higher tier model had the stuff, but it was nowhere to be found as a separate item. So I decided to make this for myself (plus, it's a nice exercise on the 3d modelling). I printed a preliminary design I had, which fitted like a charm. However, it didn't have the bolt-hole and the supports. This is yet to be printed, which will be when I visit my makerspace again. Therefore a \"work in progress\".  \r\n\r\nAfter printing I found out one of the holes didn't line up 100%. Another thing I noticed was that the lower side sits a little too low compared to the bottom of the mouse. It hits the mouse-mat instead of the PTFE. Brought up the whole fingerboard a tad. To let the design fall more in line with the thumb-side I cut a bit of the board. Should look better.  \r\n\r\nChange-log for 5.2:  \r\n- Slight fitting adjustments  \r\n- Added more clearing for the fingerboard  \r\n- Shortened fingerboard  \r\n-Big goof on the alignment, ought to be fixed. Moved screw hole up 3mm.  \r\nI edited the part, but (as before) I can't tell if it works yet because I haven't printed yet."
