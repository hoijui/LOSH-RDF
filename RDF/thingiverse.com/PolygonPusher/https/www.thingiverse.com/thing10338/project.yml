function: "This 3D-printable plastic bag holder works by clamping the edge of a plastic bag onto a wall-mounted plate. The two parts (plate and wedge) are designed with round surfaces to avoid damage to the plastic bag.\r\n\r\nThe wedge makes sure that the heavier the bag gets, the stronger it grips, but is at the same time very easy to remove.\r\n\r\nTo support larger bags, several holders can be mounted on a wall side-by-side or i.e. in a 90 degree corner between two walls.\r\n\r\nCheck out the video below:\r\n - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=douYpEH3t0g\r\n - http://geekubator.org/3d-printable-plastic-bag-holder/"
