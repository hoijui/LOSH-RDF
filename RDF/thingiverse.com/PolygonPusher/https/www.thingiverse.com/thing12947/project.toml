function = "Stoves seem to have the bad habit of loosing their knobs ;) Some days ago I noticed that my favorite restaurant's stove was missing two knobs. I therefore offered to help out and print two new ones on my MakerBot Thing-O-Matic. It was fun to model and 3D print it. I also got a free meal! ;)\r\n\r\n - The knob is made to fit a shaft of 6 mm in diameter.\r\n - The design incorporates a 6 mm set-screw to stop the knob from spinning"
