function = "This part was made with Tinkercad just to give it a quick try and attempt to make a practical 3D-printable object. The idea of 3D modeling in the web browser is clever. I look forward to more advanced modeling functions to be implemented in the future.\r\n\r\nEdit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/things/a1JOtHAFK5M\r\n\r\nSince the TinkerCAD version is very low resolution I re-modeled  it in Rhino 3D and uploaded it as a high resolution that you can download below."
