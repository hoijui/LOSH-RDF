function: "This is a holiday wreath, complete with holly leaves and berries, made out of chainmail. I've always loved the idea of printing chainmail, but having to generate support material for anything more than a single sheet is lame.\r\n\r\nThis is the first model in my attempt to breathe new life into chainmail printing. By building supports in the model, and using copious amounts of bridging, it's possible to print this simple chain ring.\r\n\r\nI've included my source files (Solidworks 2010), so feel free to poke around and try to improve this model! I tried to keep things organized and mated correctly, but a lot of the parts are simply fixed in place, rather than properly mated. Ah, well!\r\n\r\nThis design is being entered in the Proto Paradigm Winter Wonderland Contest. Thank goodness they extended the deadline!"
