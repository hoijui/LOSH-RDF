function: "How can you tell if that pyro really is on your side? Before now, it was impossible. But no longer! After downloading and printing this two-sided coin, you can be 100% positive that you'll know who's who with 50% certainty. And that's a proven fact. How do we know that? I'll tell you how. We put on our thinking hats, pulled out the calculators and slide rules, made the calculators and slide rules fight to the death, and then looked it up on the internet.\r\n\r\nSO GET OUT THERE. Print this coin, and go get those spies and/or pyros."
