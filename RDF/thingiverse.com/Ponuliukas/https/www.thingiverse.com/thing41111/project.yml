function: This car have 2 ways to gain power and speed, the first one is electricity. In 2040 the electrical motors and battery charging systems allows you to travel thousands of kilometers without a need to recharge. The other way is two new generation Ion thrusters in the back, with the help of those 2 babies you can go to mars (which is already colonized) in a matter of minutes.
