function = "While we were printing at normal speed we noticed that the desk on which our Replicator2 stands was shaking like 'crazy' when doing changes of directions.\r\nThats why we designed this kind of new 'shoes'(don't know how to call them) for the Replicator2 to reduce the vibrations.\r\nAfter changing them with the standard 'shoes' the shaking is almost gone and as a nice side effect the Replicator2 is alot quiter like normal.\r\nIt's a simple upgrade and its worth it.\r\nJust imagine your printer is making only half the noise like normal.\r\nIt should also improve your printing quality as well as reliability because your build plate wouldn't shake(vibrate) as much."
