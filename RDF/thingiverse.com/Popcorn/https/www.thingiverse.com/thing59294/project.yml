function: "Well we thought we wanted to make something  which you can't buy in your store next by.\r\nAnd in addition to that it should be really useful and help you in your daily life.\r\nWe got inspired by the shower trays which were already out there. The problem we had was that every shower bar is different and every person has got a different amount of\r\nshowergels lying around in the bathtub. Thats why we decided to make it customizable.\r\nAnd we didn't want to just give you one option for the bottom we included makerbots amazing pattern script so you can make your own unique shower tray which will make all your friends jealous ;)\r\nAnd as it turned out you can't just use it as a shower tray!! :D You can also use it as a soap tray, cloth peg/nose peg (the nose peg is especially if it stinks in your bathrrom :P).\r\nWe are really proud because its our first openscad file which we created :) \r\nHope you enjoy it as much as we do !!\r\nPlease comment bellow if you have tips or suggestions, thanks :)"
