function = "Straight road for Little Tykes Waffle Blocks, one block length. Connects to original parts snugly, but is a little loose when connected to other printed sections. Small enough to print on a 6x6 heated bed. \r\n\r\nOne part is the length of one waffle block, not a half length of road. I think I'll fix this in the next couple of days, perhaps a new set of parts specifically for snapping together to make a full length section."
