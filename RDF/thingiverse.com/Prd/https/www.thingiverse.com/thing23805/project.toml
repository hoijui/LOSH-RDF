function = "Battery box I created for my RC catamaran. I store the batteries in the bilge and they sometimes get wet. \r\n\r\nI created this design using TinkerCad. You can modify the version 2 at https://tinkercad.com/things/cZ0HxKZN9fo and version 4 at https://tinkercad.com/things/14Qw063qCVm.\r\n\r\nVersion 4 has a longer battery tube to allow for larger springs and a glue on bottom plate. It also has much thiner walls making it print faster, use less plastic, and fit in smaller spaces.\r\n\r\nI recommend version 4."
