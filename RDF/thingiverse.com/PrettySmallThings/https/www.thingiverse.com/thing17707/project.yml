function: "The inspiration here is threefold:\r\n\r\n1.  After seeing the awesome sculptural work being done on the pet monster contest, I knew I wanted to try my hand at organic modeling and I wanted a way a cool way to incorporate it into a 3D print. I decided to prototype a base to work off of in the future.\r\n2. I've been thinking about how traditional crafts can be augmented with 3D printing.  I came across an article on marionettes from a 1936 Popular Science article with some great info.  http://tinyurl.com/6reet4u\r\n3.  The size of the new Replicator platform!  Suddenly a 16\" tall marionette is doable without a million pieces.\r\n\r\nI wanted a puppet that didn't require additional hardware, and that assembled without a lot of fuss.  \r\n\r\nI tried variations of both Zomboe's snake http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4743 and Landru's springamathing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12053 as a replacement for traditional cloth hinges.  At this point, the pieces I've prototyped on my thing-o-matic don't have nearly enough movement to serve as a marionette, and thinner renditions have been too fragile.  But, I have a start of something interesting.  I'm not sure if I'll continue to spend time on an all-plastic solution, or look for ways to make tyvek cloth hinges with plastic connectors.  This figure has merit of his own, so I'm sharing it in the meantime."
