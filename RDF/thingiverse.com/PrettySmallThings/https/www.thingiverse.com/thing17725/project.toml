function = "Flexible pin connector segments to work with tbuser's Toy Robot Toolkit.  I created these in my marionette quest, and while useless for my marionette, they might be useful in a myriad of other applications.  \r\n\r\nNeither of these designs is a direct derivative of Zomboe's, Landru's or Emmett's work - but they are certainly inspired - so I'm spreading the derivative love all around.  \r\n\r\nIf you're working with solid modeling, you'll find a rebuilt, solid version of tbuser's basic pin & hole negative buried in the CAD file."
