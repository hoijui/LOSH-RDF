function: "Captured with 123DCatch at the American Museum of Natural History.  Edited and print ready.  \n\n\n\nFrom the AMNH website: \"Mass graves of these animals have been found, indicating they may have been victims of a sudden cataclysmic event, such as a flash flood. Bones of young Coelophysis have been found inside the body cavity of the larger animals. This indicates that Coelophysis was cannabalistic and fed on the young of its own species.\""
