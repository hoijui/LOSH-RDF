Edited and print ready.  \r\n\r\nFrom the display at AMNH - the description refers to a model of the Temple of the Sun - this scan is a fragment from it:\r\n\"The model below portrays the so-called Temple of the Sun at Palenque, a famous site known for the elegance of its architecture and for the stucco sculpture decorating its buildings.  Palenque temples have an unusual sanctuary in the form of a small building at the back of the inner room, and a sloping mansardlike roof.  Also typical is the crestlike structure on the roof, known as a roof comb, that gives the building added height and apparently served as a base for stucco sculpture.  Fragements remain of the sculpture that also covered the sloping roof panels.\""
