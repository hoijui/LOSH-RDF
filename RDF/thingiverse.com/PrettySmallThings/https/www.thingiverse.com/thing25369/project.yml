function: "A series of 123D Catch scans captured at the American Museum of Natural History.  These scans have all been run through 123D Catch.  In most cases, they have not been processed any further, and I don't anticipate doing so in the near future.  I've included a description of each, along with a grade.  The better the grade, the easier and more appropriate the file is for prep for 3D printing.  Even though these scans aren't print ready, there is a lot of awesome data which might be valuable to the right person.  Enjoy and share your results if you take any of these scans further.\r\n\r\nA zip file contains the photo sets, 123D Catch files, and OBJ exports with texture.  I've included a zip file of all the available OBJs for quicker access without the download times."
