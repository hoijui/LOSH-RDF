If I were to tackle this set again, I'd reduce the depth of the seats, reduce the curvature in the front legs, and take a second look at the angle of the arms.  The finish in the arms is a little loose in this print due to overhangs that are a too severe.  I had some print defects in these prints, but overall am pretty happy with how they came out.  

**Update 8/26/13 - Added two more variations of the chair - one with a shorter seat, and one with a short seat, and less width.  Source file included.""" ;
