function: "Another design in my pursuit of 3d printed purses - though this one serves equally well as a pencil case.\r\n\r\nIt's a quick print, a sleek design, and functional to boot.  The zip top closure makes a satisfying zippy noise, and holds everything closed nicely.  Kudos to gabielfp's awesome roll top box and emmett's bracelet that served as my inspiration.  \r\n\r\nWatch assembly and demo:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lyNmkLAWwA\r\n\r\nI've made subtle changes to the fabric edges, for better alignment with the side bands, since taking the photos shown in this post.  Close ups of this area appreciated by anyone who makes a print.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of options for other sizes, orientations, or the addition of a chain in future releases."
