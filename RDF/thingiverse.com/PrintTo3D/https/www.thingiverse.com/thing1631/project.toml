function = "This is a mounting system for a keychain spy camera.\r\n\r\nThe bracket is designed to bolt right onto my Ultra Stick Mini plane.\r\n\r\nYou will need a bolt and nut to assemble the pivot point.  I don\\'t know what size it is 4-40 possible.  I just found whatever bolt worked and cut it to length.\r\n\r\nYou will need to Dremel the side walls to get the camera to fit.\r\n\r\nCamera was purchased on EBAY.\r\n\r\nA rubber band holds the lid on for quick removal of the camera."
