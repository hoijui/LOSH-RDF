    okh:function """A 3D scan and print of a shell that my wife and I found on the beach while on vacation a few years back.  This is my first attempt at 3D scanning.  Scanned using David3 software with a structured light setup.  The shell was laid with the opening facing down on a turntable and rotated.  I didn't try to scan the bottom, so the software just made its best guess at what the bottom should look like.  
3/11/13 Update- I've been playing around with vapor polishing using acetone vapor and tried it out on this shell.  It turned out pretty well.  ~8 minutes in a glass jar with a tablespoon of acetone at 100C.  Use caution if you try this.  Gloves, ventilation, safety enclosure etc.""" ;
