function: "This is a special test print for use with MakerBots.  It\xE2\u20AC\u2122s designed to be test printed in ABS on a MB.  Maybe even pushing the MB to its limits\r\n\r\nThe goal: is a very strong Brutis http://reprap.org/wiki/Brutis   X carriage.\r\nBeen told that many Maker Bots were un-able to print the first Brutis X carriage design.  I then went ahead and redesigned (overkill) in a few areas where overhang issues were addressed."
