function = "I designed this bottle opener - originally as a strange character head within Sculptris. The image is a rendering of a slightly earlier version - which I then tweaked it more to make it work as an opener. I actually designed it to work with a specific sized washer (the one I am using is like 1.5cm in diameter). I originally created this creature a while ago - one of the many things I created w/Sculptris - a FREE 3D Program that Everyone should at least TRY! I kept on working on this sucker over many sittings. In the end - I thought I would turn it into a bottle opener that can be printed on a Bot."
