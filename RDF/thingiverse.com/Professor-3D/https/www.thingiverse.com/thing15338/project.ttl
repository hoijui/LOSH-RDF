    okh:function "This is a Drink Coaster design that I recently came up with. It may not be so useful to others - since the design is actually based upon my initials. My wife liked how I turned my initials into a logo - so I thought I would then turn it into a coaster. I pumped out a TON of them at he last minute - since I decided to send it out to family as Xmas Gifts for 2011 - although at the last minute. AS such - I also broke open a Mold making kit - so I could make copies. The one pic - represents a coaster I printed (in Blue) and the Copy is in White plastic. I also made 2 types of Holders - to hold them vertically - both a 4-Slot holder and a 6-Slot holder." ;
