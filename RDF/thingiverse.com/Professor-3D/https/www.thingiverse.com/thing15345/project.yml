function: "AT my day job - there is a Small kitchenette - and this Paper Towel is always on the counter in front of the things you want to get at (like the microwave). And I found that particularly annoying. And, since the co. would not cough up the expense to buy a paper towel holder - I figured this would be the FIRST thing that I would make with my Bot. And, as such - its the one product design of mine that is actually IN USE! \r\n\r\nIts been in use (as shown in the picture) for a couple months now. Although - the 1st version - I sold it to one of my coworkers - as that one was a little nicer with a red logo on it - as printed on the Bot. So - this one in the picture was the replacement."
