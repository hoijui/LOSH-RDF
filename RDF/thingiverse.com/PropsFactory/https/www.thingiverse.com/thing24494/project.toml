function = "This is a new version of the excellent quick-fit x-carriage from Richrap :)\r\n\r\nI tried to make it smaller so I designed the fixation to be perpendicular to the X axis and won around 3cm, it's not a big deal but 3cm on a 22x22cm build plate is really huge.\r\n\r\nHere is a LM10UU version http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24986\r\n\r\nOriginal Carriage:\r\n- 12cm long alone\r\n- 13cm long with one fan\r\n\r\nLow profile is:\r\n- 8,5cm long alone\r\n- 9,7cm long with one fan\r\n- 11cm long with two fans\r\n\r\nSo stay update :)\r\n\r\nUpdate Septembre 13th:\r\n- Removed old confusing files.\r\n\r\nUpdate June 19th:\r\n- REVISION, Files prefixed with R2.\r\n- Updated to new design.\r\n- Added Belt clamps (compatible with LM10UU version too)\r\n\r\nUpdate June 8th:\r\n- Fixed the holder size.\r\n- Added sketchup files.\r\n- Added ready-to-print stl.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n- Won again 4mm on the length\r\n- Re-inforced the latch bearing holder.\r\n- Fixed the manifold.\r\n- Fixed the distance between axes from 51mm to 50mm as linear bearings are push-fits it needs to be accurate.\r\n- Added Quick-Fit supports for 40x40mm fan mount, with 2 heights.\r\n- Re-inforced the plate."
