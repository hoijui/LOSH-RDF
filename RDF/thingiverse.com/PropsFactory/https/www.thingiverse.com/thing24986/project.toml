function = "Again a new derivative for the X-Carriage Quick-Fit, but this time for LM10UU !!!\r\n\r\nAlmost keeping the previous design, I got a 9,3cm this time !!! not so bad for LM10UU.\r\n\r\nI had to \"improved\" the Fan Quick-Mounts because keeping the 50mm spacing between rodes causes the fan holder crash in the bearings.\r\n\r\nTo keep the carriage as low profile as I can, I simply made fan mounts thicker, while you can hide nuts inside the fan mount !!!\r\n\r\nUpdate June 15th:\r\n- Fixed overlap in Support part.\r\n- Added Belt clamp & latch (richrap one)\r\n- Added a Fan mount for 30mm as the 40mm fans will probably crash between rods."
