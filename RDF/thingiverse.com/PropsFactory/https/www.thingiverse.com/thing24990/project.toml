I Know somehow some \"Cheap Bearings\" can do this ...  \r\n\r\nBut !!! Instead of changing all the carriage ... switching to PLA \"old style bearings\", I designed \"ready to print\" Bearings, There is Three equivalents, LM6UU, LM8UU & LM10UU !.  \r\n\r\nThey are all the same size as original bearings :)  \r\n\r\nTooth thickness is made to print well on 0.5mm nozzle, altought a LM10UU 0.35mm will print really nice :)  \r\n\r\nMore tooth is better :)"
