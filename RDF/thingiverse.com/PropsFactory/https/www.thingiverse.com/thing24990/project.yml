function: "*February 2018*\r\n*I am still using these on my main 3D printer, and they have almost 5 years!*\r\n\r\n--\r\nUpdated the LM8UU V3 (last file in the list) to simpler version.  \r\n\r\nThese Linear bearings are good replacement parts for those who get bored with \"NOISY\" LMxUU ... I Know somehow some \"Cheap Bearings\" can do this ...  \r\n\r\nBut !!! Instead of changing all the carriage ... switching to PLA \"old style bearings\", I designed \"ready to print\" Bearings, There is Three equivalents, LM6UU, LM8UU & LM10UU !.  \r\n\r\nThey are all the same size as original bearings :)  \r\n\r\nTooth thickness is made to print well on 0.5mm nozzle, altought a LM10UU 0.35mm will print really nice :)  \r\n\r\nMore tooth is better :)"
