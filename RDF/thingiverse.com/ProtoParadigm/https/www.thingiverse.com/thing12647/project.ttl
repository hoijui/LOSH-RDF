    okh:function """We picked up a Ryobi E49CM01 Power Meter and plugged it into the back of our Thing-O-Matic (MK7), recording data under various conditions. Next step will be to crack the device open and attempt some direct logging as opposed to the otherwise tried and true "Look and Type" method. Here are some highlights:\r
\r
Idle: 10 Watts\r
Enable Button from RepG Control Panel: 44.75 Watts\r
Maintain 100C on Print Bed: 41.75 additional Watts above Idle\r
Maintain 220C on MK7: 46.5 additional Watts above Idle\r
During a Print (MK7 = 220C, Bed = 100C): 107.75 Watts\r
Cost of 8hr Print @ 7 cents per kwh: $0.06\r
\r
All our data is included here but I would really encourage going here:\r
\r
http://www.protoparadigm.com/2011/10/makerbot-thing-o-matic-power-consumption/\r
\r
and reading a short write up that can give a better presentation of the data. We should have similar numbers for the Ultimaker and Mosaic shortly.""" ;
