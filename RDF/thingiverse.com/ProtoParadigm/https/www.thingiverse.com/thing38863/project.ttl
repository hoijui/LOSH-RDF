a terrible beast does call this his home.   
He's hungry. He's horrible! Though actually, adorable.   
He's Mumble the humble Abominable Snow Monster!  
He'll happily sit on your counter or table.   
Bringing good cheer and some smiles if able.  
So make him today, for keeps or to give away.  
"I'm happy you did!" Yes, that's what he'll say.  
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from ProtoParadigm!   
And don't forget to check out our Winter Design Contest for Free Plastic filament and in-store coupons! We're accepting entries until the end of the 25th, Christmas Day.
