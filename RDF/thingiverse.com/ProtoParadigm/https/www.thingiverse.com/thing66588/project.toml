function = "This was initially designed as a fix for the unwinding that was experienced by some of our loyal patrons while using some of our thinner 1.75mm PLA 2LB Spools (see below for more on this). \r\n\r\nThe result however is a handy clip that is helpful in a number of spool setups.\r\n\r\nClips 'A' and 'B' are for the 2 variations of thinner spools, clip 'C' fits our slightly thicker spools which are replacing the thin spools. See the above photos to see which spool you have."
