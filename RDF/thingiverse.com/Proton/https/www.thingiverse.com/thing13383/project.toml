function = "This is a parametric design of an electronic rain meter.\r\n\r\nIt measures precipitation, without the user having to empty the measurement glass every day.\r\nThe clapper will fill with rain until it gets top-heavy and `claps over` to the other side. Then that side will fill...\r\n\r\nThe number of claps is a measure of total precipitation."
