function: "(I'm getting 'Access Denied' replies on the idlers+mount.scad and picture, might be an escaping issue. ).\r\n\r\nThis thing is for motorization of an Azimuth/Altitude mounted 300mm Dobsonian telescope.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a belt running over large (>40cm)  quarter circle pulley bolted to the scope and on a small (less than 1cm radius) pulley direct on a stepper motor.\r\nThis should give zero-backlash, high-speed driving, with an accuracy of (assuming perfect 16 step microstepping) 11 arcseconds.\r\nWith some more gearing down, better resolution is possible, but achieving zero backlash will be harder.\r\n\r\nAnimation:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/Y1-zTE1iXZs\r\n\r\nUpdate: got the design returned from weight watchers\r\n\r\nTodo: printing, testing, resolution/accuracy tests.\r\n\r\nLonger term:\r\n * Make manual control for constant rate\r\n * Make Arduino sketch that does hour angle/declination to az/alt conversions and that can follow an object across the sky\r\n * finish Stellarium plugin to allow slew (goto) commands from within Stellarium, possibly with gcode?"
