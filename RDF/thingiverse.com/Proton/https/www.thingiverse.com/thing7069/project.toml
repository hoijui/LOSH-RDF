function = "Inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5998 . \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, can not be made as-is. Hence the work-in-progress...\r\n\r\nThis is an OpenSCAD design suitable for experimenting with a deltabot with various arm lengths. The main parameters (base width, arm length, animation toolpath etc) can be changed on the fly.\r\n\r\nIt serves me as a test of both the coordinate transformation math and the resulting practical reach for a given arm configuration.\r\n\r\nParts of it can be reused in other designs, for example the 3d line and toolpath rendering."
