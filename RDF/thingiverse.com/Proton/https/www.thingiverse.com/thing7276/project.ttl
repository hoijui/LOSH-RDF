You can find lots of examples on Youtube, for example:\r

\r
This design should not have overhangs greater than ~45 degrees, which is needed AFAIK for printablility.\r
\r
This is designed as part of the Ultimaker Challenge, to facilitate their kit packing.\r

It is slightly parametric.\r

Disclaimer: Designed by a person who has never seen a vibration bowl working, has no experience in 3d printing and does not know whether PLA or ABS holds together when vibrated.""" ;
