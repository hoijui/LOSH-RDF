function: "A vibration bowl is used for orienting and singling out small parts.\r\nYou can find lots of examples on Youtube, for example:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY2Byhj0xbY\r\n\r\nThis design should not have overhangs greater than ~45 degrees, which is needed AFAIK for printablility.\r\n\r\nThis is designed as part of the Ultimaker Challenge, to facilitate their kit packing.\r\n\r\nIt is slightly parametric.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Designed by a person who has never seen a vibration bowl working, has no experience in 3d printing and does not know whether PLA or ABS holds together when vibrated."
