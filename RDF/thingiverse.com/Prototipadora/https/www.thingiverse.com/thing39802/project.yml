function: "In the year 2040 there isn't limit for what could be printed, every material and size is possible and the recycling process has been completely rewritten. \r\nThe products are cheaper and more efficient because the internal parts could be more complex, resistant and smaller, printed directly in place. And if something is broken it can simply be reduced to its original material and reprinted again, even could collect several things and make something completely different and convenient with one's lifestyle. \r\nThere is where the Firanse R3 takes place, a completely affordable, personalized and ecological car. \r\nThis concept vehicle consists of two parts, the first one is the cab that holds the seats, batteries and the principal controls, and second part are the modular wheels that have the engines, brakes, suspension and direction system."
