function = "This is an incremental improvement on the Dual Extrusion D20 ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24663 ) by rplumley. I reordered the numbers so it is a proper distribution for a gaming die. (Opposing sides add up to 21, no consecutive numbers, etc.)  \nThis is my first attempt at editing an SCAD file and trying dual extrusion printing so special thanks, and apologies, to rplumley et al and to AKAMEDIASYSTEM ( http://www.thingiverse.com/AKAMEDIASYSTEM ) for showing me the ropes."
