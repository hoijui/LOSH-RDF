function = "This is a unique clock design. You can tell time with by looking at a series of twelve pegs on top of the clock, or with the LCD screen, if you need a more precise time. As time passes, a belt with a bump on it passes under the pegs (all happens hidden inside it) and rises them. One pass from left to right takes 12 hours, after which it takes another twelve hours to do it from right to left.\r\n\r\nYou can read time by looking at the pegs. If it's AM, then, if the second peg from the left is up, it's 2 AM. If it's PM, then it's the opposite : the second peg on the left means 10 PM. Take a look at my images, one explains it better."
