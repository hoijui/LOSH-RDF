function: "This is a concept alarm clock that I designed to help people wake up in the morning. You aim at the middle of the target with a laser pointer (1mW to 5mW of power) form a distance to make it stop (or you can wait a minute). There\\'s an LCD (green rectangle) at the bottom for time and date. There\\'s also some side lighting (in the transparent tubes) that turns on with the alarm.\r\n\r\nSome buttons at the rear are used to set the time and alarm, including a traditional alarm reset button in case the laser system fails (not shown in pictures or file)."
