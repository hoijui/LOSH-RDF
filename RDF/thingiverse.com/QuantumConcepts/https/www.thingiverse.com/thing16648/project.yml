function: "My first thing!\r\n\r\nThis is a heart-shaped box similar to the one Kurt Kobain spoke of in his lovely song, \"Heart Shaped Box.\" I uploaded two versions of the box - one is smooth on the outside, the other is not. The lid should, in theory, snap in place. This can be used to show your significant other (female) that it was totally worth spending $700 on some metal and plastic scraps.\r\n\r\nPS: The Quantum Concepts logo on the bottom is sort of a cross between a spoof and a goof. It can be removed if you prefer."
