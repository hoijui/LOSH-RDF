function: "Cereal Maestro v1.0.0.0 by Quantum Concepts\r\n\r\nI got a cereal bowl for Xmas similar to one I saw on Shark Tank last year. I thought I'd make one just for fun because I think it's a great idea.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to put cereal in one side (the sloped side, right-side in the pictures) and milk in the other. You gradually add cereal to the milk reservoir as you become ready to eat it. This will make it so your cereal does not get soggy!\r\n\r\nThis is a first draft and I haven't printed it yet.\r\n\r\nWARNING: NOT FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY SOGGY CEREAL."
