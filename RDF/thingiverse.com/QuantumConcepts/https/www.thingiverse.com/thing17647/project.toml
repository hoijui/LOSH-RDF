function = "This is a case to hold Arduino RAMPS v1.4 (and perhaps other versions) electronics. It is designed to sit atop a Prusa but I'm sure it can be easily edited to fit other needs. There are 4 feet which are inserted through the inside of the case and then they clip softly onto the top rails. I really like the way it came out, although I forgot to account for the wiring for the bed!\r\n\r\nI also have a lid which accepts a 40mm fan designed but I haven't printed it yet - I'll upload it once I know it works.\r\n\r\nThis case has cutout for power and USB on the back and 3 cutouts where you can insert one each of 6-pin, 12-pin and 9-pin interlocking connectors from RadioShack. The idea is to allow for easy relocation, etc. (really I just like making things that are neat and clean)."
