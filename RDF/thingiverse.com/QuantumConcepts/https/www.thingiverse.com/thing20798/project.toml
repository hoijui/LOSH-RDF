So I designed this PSU mount which bolts onto the back foot using the existing bolts. It should fit any standard ATX PSU. The mount slides to allow some flexibility for different setups. The mount came out a bit weaker than I had hoped. I should add more support or maybe increase the infill (I used 40%) to make this better. But for now, it works!"
