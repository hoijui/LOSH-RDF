function: "THIS JUST IN A new version has been posted which provides much more support for heavy PSUs!\r\n\r\nTHIS JUST IN...AGAIN!I've posted left and right SKPs and STLs so you can mount your PSU on either side of your Prusa.\r\n\r\nI was tired of my PSU getting in the way of the Z axis, causing the right-side to lift up and then ruining my Z-homing - causing me to have to calibrate it all over again. So I designed this PSU mount which bolts onto the back foot using the existing bolts. It should fit any standard ATX PSU. The mount slides to allow some flexibility for different setups. The mount came out a bit weaker than I had hoped. I should add more support or maybe increase the infill (I used 40%) to make this better. But for now, it works!"
