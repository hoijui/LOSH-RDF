function = "I designed this thing to \"stress\" important aspects of 3D printing. You can use it to find where your printer fails and hopefully make adjustments to fix that problem.\r\n\r\nWhile my design is not scientific or calibrated, etc., it should help to test your printer in the following areas:\r\n\r\nSection 1, marked with \"1,\" tests the accuracy of small perimeters and small infills (e.g. the \"n\" and \"e\").\r\n\r\nSection 2 tests bridging.\r\n\r\nSection 3 tests taller extrusions as well as large inlays.\r\n\r\nSection 4 tests holes and arcs.\r\n\r\nSection 5 tests slopes.\r\n\r\nSection 6 tests peaks and super-small perimeters and infills."
