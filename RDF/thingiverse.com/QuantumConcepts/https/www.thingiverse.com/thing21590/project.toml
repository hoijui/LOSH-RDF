function = "I recently got into the hobby of silk screening. So I designed this holder/rack to mount onto a wall. You can snap the silk screen into the holder and it will support it so it can dry or for storage to keep it off of your workspace.\r\n\r\nThis was designed to fit a silk screen from www.silkscreeningsupplies.com so adjustments may need to be made for it to fit other screens. The fit is tight, requiring a small amount of pressure to snap the screen in place as well as to remove it.\r\n\r\nThis came out very sturdy with the angled supports."
