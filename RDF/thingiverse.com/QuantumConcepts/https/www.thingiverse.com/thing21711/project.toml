function = "This thing cuddles a USB B Male connector and keeps it close and cozy with its female counterpart. I designed this after I noticed the USB connection to my Arduino board wiggling free. It actually disconnected during a print a couple of times. This holds the USB connector really tight and super glues to my Arduino case (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17647)."
