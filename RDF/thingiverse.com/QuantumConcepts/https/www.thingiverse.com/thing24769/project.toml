function = "This thing is meant to sit in a standard Solo plastic cup. It allows you to place an avocado pit in it and it will hold it in place better than the normal toothpicks that are used. Plus it is 3D printed and looks kind of neat.\r\n\r\nUpdated 6/13/2012: New Top Connector that snaps onto the cup; no glue necessary. Also added a fully assembled SKP."
