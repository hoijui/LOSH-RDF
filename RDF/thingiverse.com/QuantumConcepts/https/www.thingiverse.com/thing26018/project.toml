function = "I used to use a bendy desk lamp to light up the print bed but it didn't work too well so I bought a bunch of cheap USB LED strips from Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00198L9RA/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00) and then designed this mount to attach to the Y rods on my Prusa. It lights up the bed pretty well with nice clean light."
