function = "I have a 55g tank with a group of angelfish. Two of them have paired up and have been attempting to lay eggs. Well, they are successful at the \"laying\" part, but once the lights go out, somefish comes along and eats them up. I won't say who....he knows who he is.\r\n\r\nI've decided to try to breed these two and have setup a 30g aquarium for this purpose. They seem to enjoy laying eggs on the filter tubing so I've devised a breeding tube and mount system that I think they will like.\r\n\r\nI used standard 1.5\" PVC tubing. It is assembled, from bottom up, like this:\r\n\r\n[C][====P====][F][M][B]\r\n\r\nC: Coupling\r\nP: Pipe\r\nF: Female Threaded Coupling\r\nM: Male Threaded Coupling\r\nB: Bushing\r\n\r\nI used threaded couplings because it allows the pipe to expand and apply vertical pressure and keep itself in place. The bushing at the end has a large washer in the inside and a bolt running through. The bolt then runs through a 1/2\" right angle piece of aluminum. The aluminum then snaps into Clip C, rests on Clip A and is secured into Clip A by Clip C and a small bolt and nut."
