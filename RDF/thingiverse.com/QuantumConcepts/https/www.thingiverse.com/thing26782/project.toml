function = "This is based on the excellent, original, Noise & Vibration Dampener. I redesigned this in Sketchup to achieve:\r\n\r\n1] More dampening (unconfirmed).\r\n2] More support.\r\n3] Less likelihood that it will deform over time under the weight of the machine.\r\n\r\nHaving dual micro-feet  will naturally force the foot-holder (top) part closed, applying pressure to the foot of the machine and thereby keeping the dampener itself from deforming."
