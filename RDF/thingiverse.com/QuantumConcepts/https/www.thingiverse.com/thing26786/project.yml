function: "I wanted to print a couple of these for a friend who has two Westies. I added their names to the magnet to add some extra pizzazz and personalization. So, if you have a dog named Sophie or Riley, you can download the STLs and just print! Otherwise, download the Max STL and add your own text in SketchUp.\r\n\r\nThese are sized to fit these magnets: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YF92PA/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i04"
