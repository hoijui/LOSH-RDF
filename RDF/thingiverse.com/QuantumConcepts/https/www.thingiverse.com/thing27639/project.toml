function = "**Note - v2 is here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36670**\r\n\r\nBy designing this I wanted to accomplish a couple of things:\r\n\r\n - Ability to mount fan(s) in the front of the X carriage instead of the side, allowing for greater X movement.\r\n - Use 4 bearings for better stability. I found that the weight of the motor being on the left side of the X carriage tended to tweak that side of the carriage (the front right side where there is no bearing).\r\n - Ability to have a fan duct that wraps around two extruders.\r\n - Reverse the way the right side belt/tensioner worked so I no longer had to twist the belt.\r\n\r\nUpdated 7/20/2012\r\n - Uploaded repaired STLs and repaired Fan Duct SKP.\r\n - Added Fan Mount Cover in case a fan has to be taken out of commission so air does not escape where the fan was mounted."
