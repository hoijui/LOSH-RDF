function: "This is a dual extruder X carriage adapter for a Prusa. I'm really pleased with how it came out (so far). This is a snap-together design that tightly clamps the hotends and will keep them held very tight so they can't move around while printing. The hotends are then driven by a Bowden extruder configuration.\r\n\r\nThere are four parts to this thing. They all snap together like a puzzle and are then screwed (tightly) onto any standard X carriage. (Try this one: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27639)\r\n\r\nUpdate (8/2/2012) Added Part B (the large piece that clamps the hotends) with screw holes. This will give a much better grip on the hotends."
