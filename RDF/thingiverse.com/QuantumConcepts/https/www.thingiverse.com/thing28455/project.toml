function = "A simple mount which holds the Bowden cable and your extruder. It \"snaps\" onto the top rails of a Prusa. I designed this so that I could use a Bowden extruder while still having my filament spools mounted to the top of the machine.  I mounted this to the front side of my Prusa but it could also be mounted in the other direction."
