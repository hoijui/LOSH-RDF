\r
The benefit to having your fans on the front instead of the side should be obvious. Side fans take up X-space and make your build area smaller. Moving the fans to the front frees up X-space. This is important if you use a 30mm deep fan, which I do.\r
\r
This is designed to sit on four bearings. I've used 3x metal bearings and 1x printed. I think both work equally as well!""" ;
