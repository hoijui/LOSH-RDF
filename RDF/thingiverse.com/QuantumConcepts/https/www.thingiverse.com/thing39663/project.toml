function = "It's a true wonder to live with a canine companion. Some, however, do not think so highly of their fur. We are fur freaks and don't want our little dog on the couch. However, he is allowed on the couch if he is sitting on a lap - he is also allowed on the couch upstairs. This confuses his tiny walnut-brain, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nSo, I've devised Dog-B-Goneâ„¢ - the expandable and collapsible furniture fence!\r\n\r\nNote: this won't work for larger or more boisterous dogs."
