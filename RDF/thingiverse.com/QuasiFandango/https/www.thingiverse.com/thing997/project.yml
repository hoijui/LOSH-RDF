function: "It's a puzzle/game type thing just to play around with. You're supposed to be able to spin the three inserts around and remove them, but there is only one way they fit together to sit flat. It's not very difficult, but it's still fun.\r\n\r\nI didn't design this object. I saw a model of it and recreated it in Rhino."
