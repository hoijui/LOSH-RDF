function = "A little model (loosely) based on the Cray Supercomputers of the 70's and 80's. I don't know how well it will print, and would be happy if someone would print one and upload a photo of it.\r\nDue to incredibly bad planning on my part, the whole thing is 3'9\" tall. I assume that it can be scaled down for printing, and the original Sketchup file is included if you want to modify it."
