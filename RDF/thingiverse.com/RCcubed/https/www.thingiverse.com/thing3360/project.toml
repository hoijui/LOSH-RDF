function = "This is an assembly jig to build chassis for RC vehicles. It is used to square the whole chassis build. In the photos you can see how the wheelbase is controlled with the placement of the axles and the parts used to do so. I will be adding to this as I build more additions to the jig.\r\n\r\nBase Mounts:\r\nAre used to mount other pieces and parts to the Jigs Base.\r\n\r\nWheelbase/Axle Mounts:\r\nAre used to hold the axles at a specific distance form each other for creating the Wheelbase for the chassis to be built. As well as the hold the axles ridged for control arm mounts."
