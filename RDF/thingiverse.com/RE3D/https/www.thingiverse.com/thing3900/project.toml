function = "I designed this parametric mount to allow a dowel to rest easily atop a milk crate to provide a support for any filament spindle of suitable diameter.\r\n\r\nThe part clips nicely and securely onto the rim of any milk crate.  The dowel rests on top of this part and is held down by gravity. \r\n\r\nFuture work:  If I find that the dowel tends to migrate along its rotational axis while turning on these guides, I might add a piece to retain it, either as a separate clip, or as an integrated \"lip\" on this clip piece.\r\n\r\nWhile it is a direct derivative of neither, this work was inspired by rplumey's milk crate mount ( http://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:1335 ) for charlespax's cardboard spool ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1550 ).  Thanks!"
