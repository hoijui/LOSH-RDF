function = "Ukarmy04's quadcopter frame looked like an awesome starting place for my project, but I only have a printrbot jr with a tiny build volume. For those of you that may be in the same boat, I've cut it up into pieces that can be bolted together with 1/8inch hardware.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The rounded mounting tabs didn't print very well. So I made them square. There were also some issues with the stl file. That has been repaired as well."
