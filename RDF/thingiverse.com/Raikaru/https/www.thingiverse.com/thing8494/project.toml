function = "I needed to create a neat little thing for a senior in highschool for completing the final tech class that is available in a 5 course program. We normally play Bloons Tower Defence 4 and I had the idea of making a monkey from it. We are currently just doing a regular Dart Monkey, but there may be attachments that you can add on to upgrade your monkey. Currently this is a work in progress and I only have the head, body, and two legs printed. I still need to create the tail and arms, the arms i will be making in Autodesk Inventor like the other parts, but if i cant properly make the tail in Autodesk then it will be made in Google Sketchup. We will be making a wrench for this monkey because we need some tech reference."
