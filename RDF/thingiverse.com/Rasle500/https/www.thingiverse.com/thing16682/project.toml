function = "Please see my reason for making this thing here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16662\r\n\r\nI need the tap holder for rethreading holes after powder painting. That is why i made the handle thicker. For a drill holder it might be better with a thinner handle. Let me know if you want me to make one :)\r\nThe insert is drawn with a Ã˜6,1 hole.\r\nI will also change that for you if needed.\r\n\r\nINFO: I have measured some other taps at work today. They do not match the size of the cheap ones I use at home.\r\nSo please check if the ones here will match your tap.\r\n\r\nI will post new inserts soon."
