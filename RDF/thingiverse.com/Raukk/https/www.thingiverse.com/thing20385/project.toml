Warning: not recommended for cardboard chess boards. \r\nI also thought about Chocolate chess, though I suspect eating the pieces you take would be required.\r\nYou could use this with just about any liquid that solidifies, such as latex, but I'm not sure why you would.  \r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad.
