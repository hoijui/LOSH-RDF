function: "Designed for http://blog.tinkercad.com/2012/03/19/design-a-chess-set-win-a-makerbot/\r\n\r\nI thought it would be interesting to make Ice cubes in the shape of chess pieces, use food dye (or Kool-Aid) for coloring the black pieces(you could then play a variant of timed chess, where a piece is gone once it has melted beyond recognition). Warning: not recommended for cardboard chess boards. \r\nI also thought about Chocolate chess, though I suspect eating the pieces you take would be required.\r\nYou could use this with just about any liquid that solidifies, such as latex, but I'm not sure why you would.  \r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad.
