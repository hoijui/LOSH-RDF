function = "You will need to buy some 1/8inch tubing and you will need 1/4inch dowels. I am using two layers of 1/4 peg board to place the dowels in separate the two layers by 1/2 inch so the 1/4 dowels will not fall over.\r\n\r\nThe 1/8 tubing fits into the Ball_with_large_hole1.stl\r\nThe bracket_large_holder_rotate.stl Attaches to the 1/4 dowels and the Ball_with_large_hole1.stl.\r\n\r\nThe Ball_no_hole_1.stl is to be used to maintain the proper distance between the two tracks or tubes.  \r\n\r\nYou can use a marble or a 3/4inch ball bearing. Just check that it will pass over the holders for the tubing.  \r\n\r\nThe Ball_with_large_hole_10mm_high.stl is to be used if you need to join two ends of tubing."
