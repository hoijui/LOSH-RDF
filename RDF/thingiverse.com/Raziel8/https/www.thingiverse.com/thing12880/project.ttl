    okh:function """You will need to buy some 1/8inch tubing and you will need 1/4inch dowels. I am using two layers of 1/4 peg board to place the dowels in separate the two layers by 1/2 inch so the 1/4 dowels will not fall over.\r
\r
The 1/8 tubing fits into the Ball_with_large_hole1.stl\r
The bracket_large_holder_rotate.stl Attaches to the 1/4 dowels and the Ball_with_large_hole1.stl.\r
\r
The Ball_no_hole_1.stl is to be used to maintain the proper distance between the two tracks or tubes.  \r
\r
You can use a marble or a 3/4inch ball bearing. Just check that it will pass over the holders for the tubing.  \r
\r
The Ball_with_large_hole_10mm_high.stl is to be used if you need to join two ends of tubing.""" ;
