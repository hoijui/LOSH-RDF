function: "This is a fan holder for a 50mm x 50mm x 11mm fan.\r\n\r\nIt was inspired by this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8183\r\n\r\nI made it because I could not find the right current setting for my stepper driver to keep the motors cool, and not lose steps.\r\n\r\nI've added a butchered heatsink to improve the cooling capacity.\r\nNow my X stepper stays cool, and doesn't mis a step! \r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, there's a hole for the wires.\r\n\r\nThe Y heatsink doesn't need a fan because it's bigger.\r\nIt's held in place by a suitably edited large paperclip."
