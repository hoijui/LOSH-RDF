function: "Updated as of 8:11pm PST 4/4/12\r\n\r\nOk!  Four days into the project, and I've gotten feedback from all corners on the initial two designs.   I'll be back next week with an updated design.  If you'd like to get more involved with the project (and I'm looking for collaborators!) just send me a private message, or leave a comment on MindToMatter.org\r\n\r\nMost Recent Beehive Project Blog:\r\nhttp://mindtomatter.org/category/projects/osmpbeehive-project/\r\n\r\nCheck out the feedback at http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/rrng2/the_open_source_modular_printable_beehive_project/ - Beekeepers contributing!\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis design was my (initial) inspiration\r\nhttp://www.hexhive.com/the-hive/\r\n---------\r\nNOTE: THIS IS A PARTIAL VERSION OF THE CURRENT BEEHIVE PROJECT BLOG POST, the whole thing won't fit here and can't have links so please see the full thing at http://mindtomatter.org\r\n---------\r\nThe new version of the OSMPBeehive is just about ready for \xE2\u20AC\u0153primetime\xE2\u20AC\x9D, I am dubbing it 0.2 as it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s still just me getting whats in my head down in 3d without figuring out exact numbers (not parametric yet, sorry!).   Looking more at Makerslide, I think that\xE2\u20AC\u2122s our support material \xE2\u20AC\u201C MakerSlide is an aluminum V rail integrated into a standard extrusion profile.\r\n\r\nAn installation would be two 4\xE2\u20AC\xB2-7\xE2\u20AC\xB2 legnths set 2\xE2\u20AC\xB2 or so in the ground, with the wheel grooves on both facing inward.  Those seem pretty ideal for the type of ratcheting \xE2\u20AC\u0153insert Clean unit in the bottom, remove Full unit out the top\xE2\u20AC\x9D system I mentioned in the brainstorm post.\r\n\r\nWithout further adue, here she is!\r\nI call it the Hivestack, the bottom unit is suspended off the ground and the bottom holes would be covered by strong wire mesh.  The central nesting shaft is now gone, and  the comb-templates create a sort-of library feeling with narrow corridors between the frames.  I was able to increase the number of full-size frames to 6 with this configuration.  The floor plate which was previously a seperate piece is now integrated into the body, each unit will nest on top of the next with little or no gap.  There are still entrance holes on all four sides, but only one row per module now (two rows was a bit silly) \xE2\u20AC\u201C Also, I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve angled the round entrance holes up at a 45 degree angle to make them easier to defend and to keep out rain.  Since we got rid of the \xE2\u20AC\u0153floor\xE2\u20AC\x9D piece, that means the top unit needs a roof of some kind to keep out the weather. I havn\xE2\u20AC\u2122t put much thought into it, but when my wife saw it she said it looked like a little elf house made from a tree.  Me?  I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m just subconsciously emulating the Ukranians.  Any ideas or clever things we should build into it?\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online\r\n\r\nHivestack .2 is available here, if anybody wants the .stl files they are available https://tinkercad.com/things/1ZluQmZ6ORE"
