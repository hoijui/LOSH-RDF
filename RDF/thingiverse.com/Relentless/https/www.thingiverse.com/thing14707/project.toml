function = "This is a simple wire clip I made to tidy up the thermocouple on my Makerbot Thing-O-Matic.  It's designed to clip to the wood.  I imagine Makerbot uses the same thickness of plywood with all of its models, so it ought to work on any model of Makerbot.  It provides a nice snug fit, and is tapered for easy installation."
