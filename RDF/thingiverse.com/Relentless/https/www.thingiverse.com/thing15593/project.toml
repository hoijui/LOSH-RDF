function = "This is a filament guide and Dust Guard for the Thing-O-Matic.  I jut finished making a spindle for the Thing-O-Matic which left me with a need for a filament guide, but I also wanted a dust Guard, so I combined the two things into one part.  This part was design to fit on either the front or rear top of the Thing-O-Matic.  Enjoy."
