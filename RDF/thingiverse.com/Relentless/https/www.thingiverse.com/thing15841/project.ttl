    okh:function "This is a replacement 1911 busing wrench I made for a friend at work.  The 90 degree off-set is a little more ergonomic than the aligned design that is the most common.  Plus I only saw one other and thought there was some room for improvement.  The ribs on the bottom of the wrench help reduce the amount of plastic necessary to make the wrench while adding rigidity.  Note that this wrench will only work for military 1911 models." ;
