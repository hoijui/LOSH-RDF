function: "UPDATED:  Note that the design has been updated on 2/1/12.  The improved design has proven much more reliable and sturdy than the original.  Pictures of the finished product will replace the outdated first rivision shown.\r\n\r\nThis is a project long in the making.  This was one of the very first things I thought of to make if I ever got a MakerBot.  No one has coat hooks but plenty of coats. In my office these things are so rare you'd think you have to win them off a terrible Dread Office Supply Clerk in an epic boss battle.  This in turn leads to a lot of rather interesting substitutions involving duct-tape and paper clips.  \r\n\r\nBut I thought I could improve on that a bit.  So here it is, an Adjustable MakerBot Cubicle Coat Hook. \r\n\r\nI designed it with everyone in mind.  I designed it to use 10-32-1/2\" Screws with 3/8\" nuts.  These should be easy to find.  I further chose the screws with the flat or Phillips head so there's bound to be a way to tighten it in the office.  I also made the back stop adjustable so that it can be moved and secured to any size cubicle wall.\r\n\r\nI'm really happy with the way this turn out.  And I think it looks pretty slick too. Plus I think it could be used for other great things like, holding hats, hanging plants, and small orangutans who have inexplicably found they're way into your office and need a good hook to hang on to.\r\n\r\nI hope my fellow cubicle drones can make great use of this."
