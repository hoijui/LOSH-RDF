\r
I looked around a while back and noticed that, to my surprise, that there wasn't a basic wax comb for surf boards available on Thingiverse, so here you are.  Its a cheap little thing to start with but I thought it would be cool to be able to customize your own.  So go for it.\r
\r
Please modify this to fit your tastes.\r
\r
I included a basic version and a version that I put one of the Buket O' Octopi because I thought that would look cool.  (Note that the one in the picture was one I made for the a guy that helped me pick out my first board.)""" ;
