It allows you to keep a cap on your can without the danger of, you know... spraying yourself in the face unintentionally.  After all no one wants to unintentionally bust a cap.  lol.  So think of it as a safety switch for you cans.  \r

But I'm always loosing these things and stores usually don't have spares, so here's one you can just make copies of.""" ;
