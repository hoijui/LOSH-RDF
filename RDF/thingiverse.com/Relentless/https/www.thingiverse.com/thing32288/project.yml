function: "This is something I'm very proud of.  It was one in fact on a list of the first ideas I had when I decided to print in 3D.  Its an organizer for spray paint caps.\r\n\r\nI've been working with spray paint for a while now, and something I've always wanted was a way to organize my caps so i didn't have to hunt them down in a bag or a box.  It takes a lot of time and effort.  So I thought I could just figure out a way to hold them together into a clip or something. I ended up with this design.  \r\n\r\nI liked it because I managed to accomplish my goal using only two unique parts, and I went through seven revisions of this project before I was happy with the fit and function, but pretty happy with the overall design so far. \r\n\r\nSo let me know what you guys think."
