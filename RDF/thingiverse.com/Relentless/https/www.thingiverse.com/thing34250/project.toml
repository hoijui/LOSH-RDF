I saw something like these last year from Starbucks and thought they were cool looking.  \r  \n\r  \nI improved on the design by printing the cup out of PLA, recycling a coffee sleeve for the sleeve, and using hemp twine to make the loop, thus making the whole thing relatively eco-friendly.  The whole thing is biodegradable.  How cool is that?\r  \n\r  \nSo here you are let me know what you think.\r  \n\r  \nMerry Christmas to all, and to all a good cup of joe."
