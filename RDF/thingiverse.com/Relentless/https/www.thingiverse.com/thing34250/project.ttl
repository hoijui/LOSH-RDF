\r  
This is a Coffee Cup Christmas Ornament.  I saw something like these last year from Starbucks and thought they were cool looking.  \r  
\r  
I improved on the design by printing the cup out of PLA, recycling a coffee sleeve for the sleeve, and using hemp twine to make the loop, thus making the whole thing relatively eco-friendly.  The whole thing is biodegradable.  How cool is that?\r  
\r  
So here you are let me know what you think.\r  
\r  
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good cup of joe.""" ;
