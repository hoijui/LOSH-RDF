function: "These are a pair of replacement grips for a MP25 Handgun.  The ones my client wanted replaced had become badly warped due to the high humidity levels here in the south,and the gun is apparently rather archaic and replacement hardware is both rare and  relatively costly, so he wanted a plastic replacement that would hold up better.  \r\n\r\nThese grips were design to be reproduced using ABS, as the design accounts for the shrinkage of the ABS."
