function: "Who says a zombie can be useful and productive member of a civilized society?  They're heads make great pin cushions.  \nHere is a doodle I drew at work the other day, and just felt like bringing it to like...er... umm... unlife?  \nWell anyway its a special gift for someone specials who's as likely to have a copy of a fashion magazine as they are a copy of a necronomicon. lol.  \nUPDATED 2-25-12:  Corrected SkethUp Model and fixed several errors in stl file.
