function: "Hello my fellow trekkers of the tarmac, my gentlemen of the grind, and my damsels of the downhill. \r\n\r\nFor those of us who skateboard, risers in general can be a useful tool to reduce the chance or wheel bite, spread the stress from our trucks to our boards, or just account for more heavily cambered decks.  \r\n\r\nHowever, until now you you've had to travel to the store and buy whatever they had in in stock, in whatever color they had in stock, and whatever size they had in stock.  And if you wanted an angled riser setup you had to Frankenstein together separate height and angles riser section to get your perfect height and angle setup.  But no longer.\r\n\r\nI submit to you the first customizable skateboard riser.  \r\n\r\nThe riser may be customized to either the new or old school truck hole formats, the truck width and length, the riser thickness, the riser angle, and custom text may be added to the back of the riser.  I hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n[In the future I would like to add cut-outs to the riser for noise reduction and just for another added level of customization.]"
