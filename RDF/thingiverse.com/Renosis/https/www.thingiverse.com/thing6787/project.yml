function: 'This is a simple mounting system for a fan. It was designed for a MakerBot Thing-O-Matic. I am pretty sure it will work for a cupcake. I needed some simple solution while I wait for my MK6 stepstruder. I was trying to print cube gears by Emmett http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6073 (observe picture: Black print before fan, Blue print after fan). Anyway, I needed something easier to install, adjust, repoint and remove than Around the Nozzle Cooling http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6173 by Scanlime or Ducted fan http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5756 by Iwo, which are far better solutions than this. But from my understanding, I won''t need it with the stepper extruder because of the ''cool'' skeinforge plugin.'
