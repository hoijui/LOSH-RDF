function = "This is a 6-Pin Shrouded Male Connector which accepts an IDC Connector. I bought some Polulu Carrier kits and only a 10-Pin Connector was included. Unfortunately, I don't have any electronics suppliers in my town and I didn't want to wait for a delivery, so I built my own. \r\n\r\n Update:  Openscad Parametric Version coming soon. \r\n\r\nI keep meaning to learn some OpenScad so I can easily make these types of things parametric, but every time I start, I end up thinking, \"Man I could get this done in like 20 seconds in Sketchup\"."
