function: "This is an entry in the MakerBot United contest.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to see how good a city would look printed out on a Thing-O-Matic. What better city to choose than New York? So here is lower Manhattan. The file was originally downloaded from Google's 3d warehouse, but it has been heavily modified to make it printable. This was created by MakerBlock and I. The bridges didn't come out too well, but to scale them up so they would be recognizable would just make them ridiculously big.\r\n \r\n\r\nOriginal sketchup file was created by Wolfman and was dowloaded here:\r\n\r\nhttp://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=2ce6d321c188c63f6de399f9a6d47fc8&prevstart=0"
