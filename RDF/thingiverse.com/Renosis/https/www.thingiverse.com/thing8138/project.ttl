These are a set of Windup ChatterBox Teeth, like the kind you get in gag stores or the kind "The Joker" always seems to have in "Batman". The two toned teeth are of course achieved by changing the filament at the proper time during the print. The wind-up portion is driven by a clock spring, which you can get from any old wind-up toy (or a wind-up clock, but why would you want to destroy a clock?). I got this particular clock spring from a Dollar Store Easter Toy, you can see the pictures of the Harley Riding Easter Bunny I sacrificed in the instructions.   



The Drive Mechanism is a Geneva Drive, which is pretty common for a wind-up toy. You wind up the spring and it rotates a cam shaft, opening and closing the teeth. Unfortunately, we could never get the mechanism to work properly. The teeth chatter of course, but the problem here is they chatter too fast and the clock spring expends its energy WAY too fast. We still have a few days left in the competition, so if anyone thinks they have a solution for this and would like to collaborate, speak up now!  



We have tried every thing we can think of and are at our wits end. We thought gears would produce enough friction to slow the clock spring down, but they don't!""" ;
