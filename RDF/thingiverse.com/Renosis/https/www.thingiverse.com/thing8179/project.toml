function = "This is a Collapsible Flower or push puppet. You push the button on the bottom and the flower goes limp. Designed in OpenSCAD, Source Files included.  \r\n\r\n*** UPDATE *** I have made a change to the Button... which is located in Flower-Red.stl and also on the Flower-Tray.stl. I have also uploaded a new version of the OpenScad file with the changes. Basically, it makes the button shorter, which allows for more movement in the pot, which will make the flower go even limper! It makes it look much nicer. New video posted below! \r\n\r\nHere is a Video of the flower in action:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjEeOx-yp4o\r\n\r\nUpdated Video Showing the old and new versions of the flower:\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/K2dZtu1U94U"
