function: This is a model of the MakerBot Mk6+ Safety Cutoff Switch. I designed it for Modeling use when designing for MakerBot. For example, I am about to make a bracket for this thing that will include a Terminal Strip, that will mount in the bolt hole of the Z platform between the Stepper Motor Threaded rod and the Extruder.
