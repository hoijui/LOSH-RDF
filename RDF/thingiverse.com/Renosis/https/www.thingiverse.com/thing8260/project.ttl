    okh:function "This is a mounting bracket for the MakerBot Mk6 Plus Safety Cutoff Switch. The manual says to drill new mounting holes in your Z platform and mount it on the side. I did not want to do this. So I made a bracket for it. It also includes a mounting area for a terminal strip. Currently, the terminal strip mount is configured for a 6 slot terminal strip, which is overkill, my current configuration only uses two slots... but with all the upgrades coming out and the magnetic encoder, I figure it is good to leave room for growth. If you want to adjust it, just edit the included OpenScad file." ;
