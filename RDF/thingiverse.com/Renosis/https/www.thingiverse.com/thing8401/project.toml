Hope you Like it!\r\n\r\n\r\nBot Bling Design Challenge by Carmiac: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7784\r\n\r\nI decided to do a Castle theme. Included in Castle MakerBot are four turrets, several coat of arms, medieval wall torches, stained glass rose window, and runic keypad for the Gen4 interface. I also couldn't resist putting a dragon in there, but that is Tbuser's design. \r\n\r\nMost of this was designed in OpenScad. Originally it was designed in Sketchup, but then I learned OpenScad and started over and redesigned everything. The only thing that remains in Sketchup is the stained glass window, but I will work on moving that to OpenScad as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to poke around in any of the OpenScad files, I highly recommend you check out the Coat of Arms. It is parametric and you have a choice of 7 different logos to be placed in 3 different positions. I have uploaded some renditions here. \r\n\r\nThe Torches are made from LED Tealights! They flicker kind of like real fire. These torches were difficult to photograph in low light, but I did the best I could.\r\n\r\nThe castle turrets snap right on to the rod end caps on a thing-o-matic.\r\n\r\nThe stained glass rose window has some pieces printed in blue PLA, natural PLA, red ABS and black ABS. \r\n\r\nI have intentions to add a few more things to this, if I have the time. There is just so much more I want to do.\r\n\r\nHope ya like it!\r\n\r\nUpdate... added this video of me showing the various parts of the castle. Focus is a little off on some of the close ups and the stills on the left probably do the project more justice. I recommend turning down the volume too, the only noises are me being clumsy and banging into things. I guess I should have talked through some of it, but it is getting late and it probably would have made the video worse than it is! ;P \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xot8MsyZZ0s"
