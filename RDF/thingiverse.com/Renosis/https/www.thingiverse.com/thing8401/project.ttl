Bot Bling Design Challenge by Carmiac: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7784\r
\r
I decided to do a Castle theme. Included in Castle MakerBot are four turrets, several coat of arms, medieval wall torches, stained glass rose window, and runic keypad for the Gen4 interface. I also couldn't resist putting a dragon in there, but that is Tbuser's design. \r
\r
Most of this was designed in OpenScad. Originally it was designed in Sketchup, but then I learned OpenScad and started over and redesigned everything. The only thing that remains in Sketchup is the stained glass window, but I will work on moving that to OpenScad as well.\r
\r
If you wish to poke around in any of the OpenScad files, I highly recommend you check out the Coat of Arms. It is parametric and you have a choice of 7 different logos to be placed in 3 different positions. I have uploaded some renditions here. \r
\r
The Torches are made from LED Tealights! They flicker kind of like real fire. These torches were difficult to photograph in low light, but I did the best I could.\r
\r
The castle turrets snap right on to the rod end caps on a thing-o-matic.\r
\r
The stained glass rose window has some pieces printed in blue PLA, natural PLA, red ABS and black ABS. \r
\r
I have intentions to add a few more things to this, if I have the time. There is just so much more I want to do.\r
\r
Hope ya like it!\r
\r
Update... added this video of me showing the various parts of the castle. Focus is a little off on some of the close ups and the stills on the left probably do the project more justice. I recommend turning down the volume too, the only noises are me being clumsy and banging into things. I guess I should have talked through some of it, but it is getting late and it probably would have made the video worse than it is! ;P \r
