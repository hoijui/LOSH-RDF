function = "And the 3d printer saves the day yet again!\r\n\r\nA family member lost the back to a wrist watch. It was a watch he enjoyed wearing and has been searching real hard on the internet for a replacement back. I offered to try and print him one.... half expecting to fail miserably.\r\n\r\nTo my surprised, it actually worked really well. The replacement snaps in and stays in! You can tell I wasn't expecting it to work because of the bright blue color I printed in. :]\r\n\r\nI know this is definitely not a permanent replacement. And I didn't have an o-ring or anything so I doubt it would fair well in a wet environment. But it is a good solution so he can wear the watch while looking and waiting for a replacement to arrive."
