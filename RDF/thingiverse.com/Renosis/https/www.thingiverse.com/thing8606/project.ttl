\r
A family member lost the back to a wrist watch. It was a watch he enjoyed wearing and has been searching real hard on the internet for a replacement back. I offered to try and print him one.... half expecting to fail miserably.\r
\r
To my surprised, it actually worked really well. The replacement snaps in and stays in! You can tell I wasn't expecting it to work because of the bright blue color I printed in. :]\r
\r
I know this is definitely not a permanent replacement. And I didn't have an o-ring or anything so I doubt it would fair well in a wet environment. But it is a good solution so he can wear the watch while looking and waiting for a replacement to arrive.""" ;
