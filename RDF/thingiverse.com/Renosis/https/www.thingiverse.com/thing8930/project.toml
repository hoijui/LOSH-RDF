function = "This is Gangsta Chess! Now you can wage your own criminal underground turf war in your home!\r\n\r\nThis design is a mashup/derivative based on the original gangsta, created by the OG himself, Yzorg.\r\n\r\nI designed this as an entry to a design challenge that was created to settle a friendly disagreement between MakerBlock and I. I guess this is how makers settle disputes!\r\n\r\nEach gangsta has his own special chess style hat (or replacement head for the knight) to signify which piece he is. He also has a piece logo on his shirt, to make it easier to identify the pieces, because there is nothing more frustrating than playing chess with pieces that are hard to identify or not instantly recognizable.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the deadline for the challenge is coming up really fast, so I was only able to print up the black pieces minus pawns. I expect to use Z scaled down gangstas for pawns.\r\n\r\nThe files were created in OpenScad. I have uploaded the file, but the code isn't that clean. \r\n\r\nThanks to Syvwlch and MakerBlock for their advice during creation.\r\n\r\n Update: Unfortunately, the pawns, which I am printing 8 simultaneously, are going to take 6 hours to print! So, I probably won't have the entire chess set printed (white pieces) until Wednesday morning."
