function = "The guys at Moving Brands challenged us to help them print their own Chocolate Advent Calendar in a month.\r\n\r\nWe already knew about the Frostruder, and had most of the parts to build a RepRap Prusa, so the solution seemed obvious. They ordered a Frostruder, and we got busy building their Prusa.\r\n\r\nThings got exciting when we tried to mount the Frostruder to the Prusa carriage - it was just too big and bulky!\r\n\r\nLuckily, inspiration struck. We stripped down the Frostruder to the bare bones, and used the Prusa to print its own adaptor. \r\n\r\nLo and behold, chocolate printing goodness!\r\n\r\nMoving Brands Advent Promotional Video: http://vimeo.com/33775105\r\nMoving Brands Advent Calendar: http://www.movingbrands.com/advent"
