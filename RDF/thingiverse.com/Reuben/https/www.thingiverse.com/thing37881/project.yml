function: "I have some awesome spools of filament from Printrbot and wanted a hub to use with bearings. This thing is that thing.\r\n\r\nThis is an early work. Of the get go I see it could be a little over built in areas and under built in others.\r\n\r\nUpdate: The *mk2_fixed.stl file was ran through cloud.netfab.com to fix it since slic3r was previewing it weird."
