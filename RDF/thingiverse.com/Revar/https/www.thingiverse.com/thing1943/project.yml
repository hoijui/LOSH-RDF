function: "At our shop we have a TV projector and a Wii with a third-party battery powered IR lightbar.  I wanted to mount the lightbar on the wall just under the TV projection, so I made this bracket to hold it.\r\n\r\n[upate:  New STL file uploaded, rotated onto its side to make for a much stronger build.  I managed to break the bottom off of the first one along a layer boundry while mounting it to the wall.  Superglue fixed it, but it\\'s better if it isn\\'t needed!]"
