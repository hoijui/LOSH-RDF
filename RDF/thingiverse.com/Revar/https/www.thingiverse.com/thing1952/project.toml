function = "This is a conceptual descendant of the CupcakeCNC from Makerbot.\r\n\r\nWhen I originally wanted to make a CupcakeCNC, I ran into the problem that a lot of parts from Makerbot were out of stock.  Since I was impatient, I ordered what parts I could (The electronics and the extruder parts) and designed up my own frame to put them in.  Then I spent a year improving on it.\r\n\r\nThe major features are:\r\n\r\n * A larger build area (about 165x175x170mm)\r\n * A heated build platform to allow warp-free large builds\r\n * Support for computer-less control via an LCD and keypad\r\n * The ACME threaded rod and guide rails makes the Z axis wobble less\r\n * Endstops on one side of each axis makes for quick and easy automatic homing/centering\r\n * The frame and sled are built mostly from parts you can find easily on mcmaster.com\r\n\r\nYes, I know, I'm a heathen American for using non-metric parts, but it turns out it's a lot harder to find all the right metric parts in American hardware stores.  Feh.  Luckily most all the non-metric parts can be replaced by metric parts of close size without too much problem.  Except the 12\" slider rods.  300mm sliders rods will be 4.8mm too short.\r\n\r\nHere's a video introduction to the Fabber Mk1:\r\n    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKoIKgk9Grc"
