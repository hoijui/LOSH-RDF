    okh:function """This is a conceptual descendant of the CupcakeCNC from Makerbot.\r
\r
When I originally wanted to make a CupcakeCNC, I ran into the problem that a lot of parts from Makerbot were out of stock.  Since I was impatient, I ordered what parts I could (The electronics and the extruder parts) and designed up my own frame to put them in.  Then I spent a year improving on it.\r
\r
The major features are:\r
\r
 * A larger build area (about 165x175x170mm)\r
 * A heated build platform to allow warp-free large builds\r
 * Support for computer-less control via an LCD and keypad\r
 * The ACME threaded rod and guide rails makes the Z axis wobble less\r
 * Endstops on one side of each axis makes for quick and easy automatic homing/centering\r
 * The frame and sled are built mostly from parts you can find easily on mcmaster.com\r
\r
Yes, I know, I'm a heathen American for using non-metric parts, but it turns out it's a lot harder to find all the right metric parts in American hardware stores.  Feh.  Luckily most all the non-metric parts can be replaced by metric parts of close size without too much problem.  Except the 12" slider rods.  300mm sliders rods will be 4.8mm too short.\r
