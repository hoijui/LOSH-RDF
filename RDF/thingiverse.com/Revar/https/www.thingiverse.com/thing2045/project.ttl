    okh:function """I decided that the timing belt gear in my plastruder was just too unreliable, so I wanted to try out a worm gear drive cog like I'd seen others have good success with.  I have a cheap 9x20 lathe and a tap set, but I was missing something to hold the gear blank to the tap while letting it rotate.  So I fabbed one.\r
\r
This isn't a robust thing, but it's good enough, and I've been able to make several small brass worm gears with it.""" ;
