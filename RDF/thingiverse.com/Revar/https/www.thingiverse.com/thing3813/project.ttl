    okh:function """This is notionally based on the Printruder II extruder body.  I like the basic design, but I had problems with filament getting kinked in the empty air below the drive gear.  I was having too many issues getting the extruder to work reliably to be able to print a new modified one with less open space.\r
\r
Since I also have a CNC mill and a tap&die kit, I just designed up and carved a new extruder head out of Aluminum.  It allowed me to have tighter tolerances, and it seems to work pretty well with my home-built Mk5-alike worm gear.\r
\r
This is designed to work with an 11mm outer diam worm gear drive wheel.""" ;
