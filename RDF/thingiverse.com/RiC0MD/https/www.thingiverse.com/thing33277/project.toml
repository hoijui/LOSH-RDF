function = "This is a modified x end clamp from the AO-101 printer parts.  I was running into an issue where these were needed to fix my Z wobble, but they were touching my motor couplers.  I needed more clearance to get the nozzle at proper height above the build platform.  This was a very simple mod to the scad files to cut away part to make a gap.  All credits go to AO."
