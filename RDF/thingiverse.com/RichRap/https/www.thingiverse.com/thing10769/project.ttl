\r
Along with the joined coloured  filaments I also designed cut-out sections and objects to fit into the voids, after printing these separately these were heated with a hot-air gun and pushed into the spaces, this was not as easy as I had expected due to the fact I made them sized to fit, really they need to be slightly smaller as they would be so much easier to join when warm and soft.\r
