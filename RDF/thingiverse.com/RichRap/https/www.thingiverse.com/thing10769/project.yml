function: "This was an experiment using some great colours of Faberdashery PLA filament and a different method to combine colours.\r\n\r\nAlong with the joined coloured  filaments I also designed cut-out sections and objects to fit into the voids, after printing these separately these were heated with a hot-air gun and pushed into the spaces, this was not as easy as I had expected due to the fact I made them sized to fit, really they need to be slightly smaller as they would be so much easier to join when warm and soft.\r\n\r\nYou can see it printing in this video here - http://www.youtube.com/user/RichRap2011#p/a/u/0/lrJPJDvobFI\r\n\r\nMore info on my blog - www.richrap.blogspot.com"
