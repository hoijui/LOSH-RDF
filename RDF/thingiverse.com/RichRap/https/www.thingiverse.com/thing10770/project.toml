function = "This was an experiment using some great coloured Faberdashery PLA filament.\r\n\r\nIt was not just designed to look pretty as I added lots of sections for filament bridging and thin layers for colour change. Skeinforge finds bridging on curves hard as it decided on an angle for the direction of bridge and does the whole section the same angle, so at points along the curve filament is going straight into the gap, this makes it a hard test especially when done at high speed, thatâ€™s why you can see a few gaps and dips in the model surface. I could make it look much better with a different Rainbow design but this was testing how the filament would perform on my Prusa Mendel â€˜Blingâ€™ machine.\r\n\r\nYou can see it printing in this video here - http://www.youtube.com/user/RichRap2011#p/a/u/1/UA97cC1QfM8\r\n\r\nMore info on my Blog - www.richrap.blogspot.com"
