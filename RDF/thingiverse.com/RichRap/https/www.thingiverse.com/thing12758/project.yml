function: "This original model by tc_fea was one of the many things that drove me on to make another 3D printer, it's great and I always wanted to make a complete shell.\r\n\r\nSo this is a 2.5X scales version with both sides.\r\n\r\nThis was also an experiment for me with using a small fan blowing across the build platform (Still use a heated bed) - if you look at the picture with the inside prints, you can see the effect of having a fan or not, on one half the inside is more loose then the other, it didn't make a difference to the outside but you get the idea."
