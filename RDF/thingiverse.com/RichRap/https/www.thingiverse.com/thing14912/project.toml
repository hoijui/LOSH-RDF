function = "This is a simple (But a bit messy) way to add some extra special sparkle to your printed objects.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is sprinkle glitter onto a heated bed before printing with PLA - Clear PLA works great with all sorts of glitter colours but coloured PLA also works very well.\r\n\r\nI have not tried ABS yet, but it should work just as well.\r\n\r\nIf you continue to sprinkle glitter as it builds (not too much) then your parts will have sparkle embedded all over them.\r\n\r\nHave fun and brighten up your prints today!"
