function = "This is a version of the Z axis mount for using M6 Threaded rod on your MendelMax Z stage motors.\r\n\r\nIt uses smaller M6 Thrust Bearings not the M8 ones used on MendelMax or the 608 bearings used on the original AlephObjects version.\r\n\r\nI have also altered the model so it prints a little easier and filled in some sections so it looks nice on the machine, also adds a little more strength.\r\n\r\nThe clamp is also included as part of the model."
