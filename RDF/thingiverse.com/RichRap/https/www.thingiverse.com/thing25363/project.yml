function: "I modified the great case by HansH to have mounting ears, some support for the SD card and get a better fit on everything, make it slightly thinner plastic and a covered USB connector as it looked a bit ugly just sticking out the top and back of the original case.\r\n\r\nIt also clips together a little more positively and has better alignment for the connectors.\r\n\r\nAnd finally it has an experimental optical light guide for the on-board LED's\r\n\r\n* - Seperate Top and Bottom Stl's added - 23-6-2012 *"
