function = "This is an attempt to make a direct-able fan mount for MendelMax (or any other printer) - I have been using fans on and off for about the past year when printing in PLA, I'm really keen to understand how fans help with the build process, so in an attempt to learn more I wanted a mount I could direct airflow across, along, and even cyclone around my printed objects.\r\n\r\nI used the ball joints from the great Fully printable PCB Vice by Sneakypoo as a great starting point for this design."
