    okh:function """Children's House is designed to be assembled without nails, screws or bolts. It's a log cabin for the current century and technology and perhaps a new age of spiritual wisdom.  

It has 11 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a large room with 30 single beds for children, a huge kitchen and an equally large social room. It is like none other. On youtube you can view the 3d walk-thru posted on this site plus two other videos at:  

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAE5Zt81hzs&feature=youtu.be  

Right click the link and select 'open in new tab' or 'open in new window' to navigate to YouTube to access the other two videos.  

If you download the CAD files and have the free CAD viewer from AutoDesk you can open the files and view the house from any angle, walk or fly thru the house or turn off layers to see how the boards connect (e.g., hiding the inside walls, outside walls, beams, roof, etc.).  

You can also download CAD drawings showing each board's series of required cuts that must be made in a specified order; to both simplify and generalize the cuts for all boards as well as for the tools required to make notches, angle cuts, troughs, etc.  

As it's designed now, the house is composed of ~7,000 pieces, like an intricate 3d jigsaw puzzle. Given all these boards, cut to specs, the structure is self-straightening, though not self-levelling. Unlike most houses, the entire structure could be disassembled and reassembled without tools (not including sub-systems, such as plumbing).  

Comments and queries can be sent to childrenshouse@mail.com.
