==================================================================\r
\r
This is a small web page that will convert your STL files to OpenSCAD files, it supports both ASCII STL and Binary STL files.  \r
The best thing about this is that instead of just embedding your stl files in the OpenSCAD you can actually make them part of it, which means they can be used with Customizer.  \r
\r
Please report all bugs to me, or just feel free to fix the bugs yourself, the JSFiddle is available publicly, you can fork it and make any changes\r
\r
How to use: \r
\r
1- Go to https://jsfiddle.net/Riham/yzvGD/\r
2- click on choose file\r
3- upload and wait for processing to finish\r
4- download the new openscad file\r
\r
*********This was tested only on Chrome - several people have left comments saying it doesn't work on other browsers, unfortunately I haven't had a chance to make it work on other browsers, but you can use the standalone version provided by fma at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64709 *******""" ;
