function = "My first real print, and my first design on thingiverse!\r\n\r\nThis is a wall (Or whatever surface you want) mount lamp base for standard drafting lamps with an ~15mm base post.  \r\n\r\nIt's designed for standard steel wood screws, commonly refered to as drywall screws. They mount flush and perfectly.\r\n\r\nI saw countless things that were table mounts for the same thing (27123, 25423, 27253, and so on), but wanting to mount these above my couch and bed led to going vertical."
