function = "The Creatr from Leapfrog (www.lpfrg.com) has a fixed idler ball bearing. I wanted to replace this by a spring loaded type to allow better control over the filament feed and allow for an easier filament change.  \nAfter a few different ideas, the Mk7 minimalistic replacement extruder seemed a nice design to start with and here is the result.  \nNow changing colors is actually a fun thing to do ;)  \nUpdate: I found that the pressure on the filament was not always enough so I moved the spring and compressed it a bit more resulting in more pressure on the spring. I've tested this for > 100 hours with ABS, Taulman Nylon and PLA and had no problems at all.  \nAlso added a longer filament guide towards the hobbed wheel, making a filament change a bit easier.  \nnote: photos with the light green parts are v2, red parts are v1  \nYou could consider building http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:321258 instead, this adds the possibility to print flexible filaments like Arnitel and Ninjaflex"
