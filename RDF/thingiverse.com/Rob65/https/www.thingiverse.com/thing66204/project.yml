function: "I always hate it to discover my tools have gone when I need them.\r\nespecially the small hex wrenches that I need with my Leapfrog Creatr are always just missing when I need them (not that I need them that much though...)\r\nSo I decided to make some clips to clip the tools on the aluminum profile that makes up the box of the Creatr. These are actually common 40x40mm extruder profiles with 8mm T-nut as delivered by Bosch, Maytec and othe manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe hex wrench holder holds 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3mm hex wrenches.\r\n\r\n29-3-2013: new tool holders added for a pair of cutters and pliers, including a spacer just for the looks :)\r\n\r\nThe SolidWorks file is for SolidWorks 2010"
