    okh:function """I need a cheap universal joint for a project I am working on so I have been playing with a few options. This is the one that seems the best so far. It is using a plastic ball from a wall track toy which is pretty far from a perfect sphere but it seems to work very well anyway. For the project I will use a cheap 1/2" steel bearing and laser cut the pieces from Delrin which has low friction. I will probably use nylock nuts on the screws to be able to adjust how stiff the movement is. \r
