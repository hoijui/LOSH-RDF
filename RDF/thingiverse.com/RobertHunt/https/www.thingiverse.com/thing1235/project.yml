function: "This is a coin with the TWIT logo on based on the original MakerBot Coin.\r\n\r\nBre Pettis was recently on FLOSS Weekly discussing the MakerBot. It is a podcast on the TWIT Network about open source projects hosted by Leo Laporte, Randal Schwartz and Jono Bacon. It is a really interesting show and they have had people from the Arduino and Processing projects in the past year and have RepRap lined up for a future show. If you missed the show you can check it out at http://twit.tv/floss92\r\n\r\nI do not own a 3D printer yet but it should print without issue as it's based on the original MakerBot Coin and is fully manifold.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Lindsay25 was kind enough to print a copy and sent it to me. I have attached a picture comparing the size to a British 2p coin. I measured it and it is accurate to the millimetre with the Blender design."
