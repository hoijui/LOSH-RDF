This is a commonly available kitchen gadget that sells for about Â£5 in the UK so why not print yourself one and save some money.\r\n\r\nThis could be made into a laser cut version with a little bit of effort if someone wants to do it, the number of portions could also be etched next to the holes.\r\n\r\nThe hole sizes were taken from these instructions: http://www.freepastatoolsplans.com/Assembly_4.htm"
