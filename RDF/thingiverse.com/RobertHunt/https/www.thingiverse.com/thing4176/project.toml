function = "This is a small printable Makerbot Wrench/Spanner that I designed in Blender. I do not yet own a 3D printer so I don't know how well it will print, it seemed to slice fine in Skeinforge despite not being manifold. I saw Oliva's blog post on the MakerBot blog about the Charm Challenge for Maker Faire so I thought this would be a nice and easy thing to print."
