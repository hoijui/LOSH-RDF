function = "Looking for a quick solution to mount my iPhone 4 on my tripod I decided to make a quick release plate. My tripod came with a quick release plate so I took out my digital callipers and made several measurements. A few minutes later in Blender I had come up with the initial design. It is designed to hold the phone in place by friction, it doesn't need to be that sturdy as I don't intend moving the tripod with the phone in place that much.\r\n\r\nIt printed very well in translucent blue PLA 4043D but the walls on top were a little too thin which meant they drooped a bit. I have since redesigned it to make the walls about twice as thick, Skeinforge should add an infill.\r\n\r\nI have included the paper measurements I've taken in case they are of any use to people. It also gives an insight into how I designed it."
