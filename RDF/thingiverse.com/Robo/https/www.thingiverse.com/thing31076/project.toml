I believe some people know it as Rubik's Twist.\r\n\r\nProperties:\r\n- Fully Printable in one go.\r\n- Functional hinges.\r\n- Clicks into 90 degree angles.\r\n- Rounded corners to have it go more smoothly.\r\n\r\nTook me 3 hours to print on the Makerbot Replicator.\r\n\r\nI've added the files for a 2 colour version using dual extrusion (named Black and White).\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad.
