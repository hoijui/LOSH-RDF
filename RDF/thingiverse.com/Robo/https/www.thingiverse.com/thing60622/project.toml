function = "Rosette for pipes for waterworks.\r\nAll the rosettes that I can get in the stores are ugly. So I needed a custom one.\r\n\r\nUseless fact:\r\nI used a cylinder with variable number of sides for the hole. I needed this to fit to a hexagonal nut. But OpenScad uses the center-to-tip size for diameter. Usually hex (and square) sizes are side-to-side. So I had to divide the radius by cos(180/NumberOfSidesForHole). Therefore this works for square, hexagonal, 8-sides 12 sided and round holes. I'm proud of myself, but noone will ever notice the true beauty of it."
