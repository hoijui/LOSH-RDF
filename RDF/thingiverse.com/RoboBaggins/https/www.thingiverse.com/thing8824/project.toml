function = "A part to fix a broken lid hinge on an old Sony record player.\r\n\r\nRecently I got a record player from a garage sale. It works perfectly, except that one of the hinges that holds up the lid was broken. This means that the lid wouldn't stay up on its own.\r\nTo solve the problem I modeled the broken part of the hinge and printed it, now it works again."
