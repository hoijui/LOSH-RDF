function = "This is still a work in progress so be kind :)\r\n\r\nIve wanted to make one of these for a long time and finally got around to modeling it and printing. The model was printed at 1:4 on a ProJet SD 3000. I am not sure how it will come out on other machines but it looks good coming from the ProJet. Just a warning the \"claws\" are very fragile so be careful and print a few extra!\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt so there will be changes in the near future:\r\n-Claws are too thin, need to beef them up a bit\r\n-Add built in battery compartment for LED lighting :)\r\n-Work on spring mechanism for claws\r\n-???\r\n\r\nThe STEP file is available here ( http://grabcad.com/library/portal-gun ). If you would like the SolidWorks model send me an email.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\nhttps://picasaweb.google.com/bruins.scott/PortalGun?feat=directlink"
