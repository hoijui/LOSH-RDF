Ive wanted to make one of these for a long time and finally got around to modeling it and printing. The model was printed at 1:4 on a ProJet SD 3000. I am not sure how it will come out on other machines but it looks good coming from the ProJet. Just a warning the "claws" are very fragile so be careful and print a few extra!\r
\r
This is my first attempt so there will be changes in the near future:\r
-Claws are too thin, need to beef them up a bit\r
-Add built in battery compartment for LED lighting :)\r
-Work on spring mechanism for claws\r
-???\r
\r
The STEP file is available here ( http://grabcad.com/library/portal-gun ). If you would like the SolidWorks model send me an email.\r
\r
Enjoy!\r
