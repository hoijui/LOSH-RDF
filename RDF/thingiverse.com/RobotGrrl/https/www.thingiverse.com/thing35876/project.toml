Or do you go surfing with your RoboBrrd?\r\n\r\nHere's a surfing RoboBrrd token!\r\n\r\nYou can get one of these tokens from RoboBrrd's Indiegogo campaign here: http://indiegogo.com/robobrrd\r\n\r\nAlthough tokens are made to be laser cut, there's lots of other things you can do with them, like print it out, or even colour it!\r\n\r\nIt's a great way to show your enthusiasm for RoboBrrd! :)"
