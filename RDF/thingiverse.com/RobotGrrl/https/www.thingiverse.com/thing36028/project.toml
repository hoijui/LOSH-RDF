Or do you wear your RoboBrrd as a hat!\r\n\r\nHere's a RoboBrrd wearing a hat token!\r\n\r\nYou can get one of these tokens from RoboBrrd's Indiegogo campaign here: indiegogo.com/robobrrd\r\n\r\nAlthough tokens are made to be laser cut, there's lots of other things you can do with them, like print it out, or even colour it!\r\n\r\nIt's a great way to show your enthusiasm for RoboBrrd! :)"
