function = "My idea is to make a set of modules that could be assembled into various CNC machines.  It is not necessarily  a printable design but laser cut maybe.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Open Structure http://www.openstructures.net/ guidelines the sliding modules would be 8cm by 8cm by 60cm and rotatable modules would be 8cm by 8cm by 8cm.  Have powered and non-powered modules.  Use multiple powered modules for more power in parallel or more distance in series.\r\n\r\nThis is just the beginnings of an idea.  I wanted to get it up here for the Makerbot giveaway."
