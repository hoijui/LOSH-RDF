function: "To announce the impending MakerBot 96khz AudioNozzle\xE2\u201E\xA2, the producers of Robot Hospital! are breaking launchdate protocol to pre-release -- a pre-mastered edition of our 3D Printed Vinyl product for printing on your Thing-O-Matic with a standard 0.5mm plastruder nozzle!\r\n\r\nAfter months of intensive research and development, MakerBot Industries is proud to announce a newly realized capacity of the MakerBot Thing-O-Matic 3D Printer- the ability to print listenable vinyl records from the desktop.\r\n\r\nThe process utilizes the MakerBot 96khz AudioNozzle\xE2\u201E\xA2 technology to print audio waveforms in real time. Using the MakerBot Generation 4 Electronics microstepping capacity, the AudioNozzle\xE2\u201E\xA2 modulates the amount of plastic deposited to create a high-fidelity waveform. The results often surpass the dynamic range of 24-bit recordings and can contain frequencies up to 57khz -- even higher than the Nyquist frequency for 96khz digital recording. You can even record directly to your 3D Printer by attaching a microphone to your computer, and singing into it.\r\n\r\nWARNING: Because this product has been compressed to permit printing on a standard plastic nozzle, listeners might experience a reduction audio fidelity. Pre-orders for the authentic 96khz AudioNozzle\xE2\u201E\xA2 will be available shortly."
