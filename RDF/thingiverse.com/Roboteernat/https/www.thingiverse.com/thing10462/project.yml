function: "**Note this has been modified**\r\nUsing this in 2 axis means the z-stage can become stuck and rise unevenly in the diagonal accross the platform due the the LM8UU not rising at the same time. i put this down to the flexibility of the acrylic axis and that the off centre weight of the printed stepper extruder means uneven forces act differntly on each axis.\r\nTherefore i recomend only fitting one axis to limit motion and using the z-wobble arrester on the opposing corner.\r\nVideo - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL301WaB8MI\r\n\r\nI have suffered wobbly z axis for a while now, and wanted more accuracy than the wobble arresters could provide (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2151) I decieded i wanted some smooth rods to limit the z axis.\r\n\r\nPrevious designs were combersome and had a few parts. I wanted something simple and easy, not to mention got rid of the z axis bars as they were slightly kinky (and not in a good way ;-P )\r\n\r\nUsing designs: LM8UU holder by Gregfrost, 8mm rod mount by twotimes and Small makerbot z stage 'U' by langfordw.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9871\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4617\r\nand\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:926\r\nI combinded these into the parts below.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit fiddley upgrade and requires a few hours modding, but results are astounding.\r\n\r\nThe green ring (from follow focus) has visable ripples, as too has the 'the pink panther woman'\r\n\r\nthe other pics are of the 8mm low rider im printing after this mod, and the results show for them selves.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo available from: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL301WaB8MI"
