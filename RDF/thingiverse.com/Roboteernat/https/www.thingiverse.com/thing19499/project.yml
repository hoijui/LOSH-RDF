function: "I will print and upload pics tomorrow hence WiP\r\n\r\nThis is a small camera case to fix onto 13mm aluminium extrusion of a quadcopter arm. Also can be fixed on using velcro straps that usually come with the camera.\r\n\r\nThese cameras are the small \"Mini DV camera\"s you can get cheaply, or expensive, and are good for recording basic flights in lower quality...\r\n\r\nI have also uploaded a sketchup file for mods :)"
