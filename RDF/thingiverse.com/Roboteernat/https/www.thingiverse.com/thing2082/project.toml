function = "This is a PCB design for 6 leds which can be attached to the extruder nozel head via the 2 threaded bolts. This is a derivative of the printable Makerbot light ring.\r\n\r\nThe circuit is a simple one, however there is an added function.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to be wired into the extruder motor connectors 1A and 1B, therfore when the motor runs forward, it lights 3 LEDs (White) When it reverses, it illumiates the Blue LED's. \r\n\r\nCheck out my video for an example here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRiLqAD1rlk\r\n\r\nand in actual use (Pinting PrintruderV2) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoPX63fTHiw\r\n\r\nAlternativly, use this pcb and add the LED's all the right way wound and have this as a circuit just to illuminate! its like potatoe waffles - lovely and versatile!"
