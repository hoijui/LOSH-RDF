function = "A tall houising for micro gear motors used in antweight robotics. These motors are simular to these: http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/mm-gear-motor-50 \r\nUnlike the original ones, the grooves which fit over the plates of the gearbox are not here in this design. The idea is to lock in the motor by heating the plastic and pressing it to firm around the motor.\r\nI am using these on mine and they work fab :-)"
