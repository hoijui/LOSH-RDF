I bought 10 of each for use in X and Y axis. I needed some form of clip to hold these into place to then epoxy onto my build plate. I made these quickly using sketch-up not so great with the paremetric stuff, but they fit and are good for my purpose, and maybe someone else?\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nLM6UU 6mm bearing ID, OD is 12mm, length 19mm\r\nLM8UU 8mm bearing ID, OD is 15mm, length 24mm."
