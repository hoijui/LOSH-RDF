\r
Im making my own 3d Huxley based on the frame, just so I can say I was able to design and make bits for it, and I wanted to use solid linear bearings.\r
\r
I came across a seller on a popular online auction site selling the LM6UU and LM8UU at Â£2.75 for 2. I bought 10 of each for use in X and Y axis. I needed some form of clip to hold these into place to then epoxy onto my build plate. I made these quickly using sketch-up not so great with the paremetric stuff, but they fit and are good for my purpose, and maybe someone else?\r
\r
Specs:\r
LM6UU 6mm bearing ID, OD is 12mm, length 19mm\r
LM8UU 8mm bearing ID, OD is 15mm, length 24mm.""" ;
