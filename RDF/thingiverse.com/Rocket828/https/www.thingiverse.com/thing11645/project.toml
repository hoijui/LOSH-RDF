function = "A lacrosse stick (crosse) that I threw together in SolidWorks. I designed it to go on a homecoming mum, so it has a hole to tie a string through. I went ahead and uploaded one without a hole for other purposes. Note that this is tiny, the shaft is 3mm wide and in total it's 9.5cm long."
