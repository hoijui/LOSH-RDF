function = "I wanted to make an arc reactor for Halloween, so I decided to print one. Disappointed that there were no printable LED arc reactors, I threw one together in SolidWorks. It houses 14 LEDs and requires no other parts besides wires. It should fit on a Maker Bot if I'm right, it's 100mm in diameter."
