function = "Small box for carrying an Arduino plus a shield. The bottom of the box has a swivel piece to lock it in place. \r\n\r\nNothing fancy but it did come out well and can be used as a starting point for other projects. \r\n\r\nMissing from the pictures are the standoffs for the Arduino. I'm going to use eight little circles with a hole in the middle and build up four little stands. Same technique as the bottom feet."
