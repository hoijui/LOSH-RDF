function = "I was frustrated with small calibration targets that required measurement of 10-40 mm.  My thought that was stepper error would be compounded over longer lengths.  So I created a 120 mm target.  The minor axis is 15mm.  The thickness is 3mm. Perhaps someone has done this already...and I'm happy to give credit where credit is due."
