function: "This is my new 4GB USB Memory ... Android! \r\n\r\nThis thing is designed around a 4GB Kingston USB Stick cause it is cheap. Maybe others work too, but i've only experience with this one.\r\n\r\nMy printed parts fitted quite good, but maybe thats just on my machine.\r\nFeedback would be great!\r\n\r\nMade with Freecad and Blender.\r\n\r\nIf you make one, please send me a picture... i love pictures ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPortions of this page are modifications based on work created and shared by Google and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License."
