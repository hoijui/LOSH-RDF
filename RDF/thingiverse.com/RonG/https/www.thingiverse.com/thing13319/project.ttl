    okh:function """I designed this to hold my iPhone4 with a Speck Candyshell case in the car when using it as a GPS. I wanted a mount that could work in any car, so the lighter socket was an obvious choice. It also eliminates the need to carry a separate charger and cable. It holds the phone quite firmly without blocking access to any of the connectors, switches or buttons on the phone.\r
\r
All of the SCAD files are included, so it shouldn't be hard to adapt the design to different phone cases, or for no case at all.\r
\r
NOTE: The design calls for a switching regulator available from Gravitech. While this part is a pin-compatible replacement for the LM7805, it is a switching regulator and this is very important. The iPhone can draw up to 1A, and the 7805 linear regulator would be dissipating close to 8W, so it is important to use a switching regulator.""" ;
