function = "I designed this variation for the low-cost Harbor Freight model#623 dial indicator. http://www.harborfreight.com/1-inch-travel-machinists-dial-indicator-623.html this gauge has a rounded ball on the end that glides right over the Kapton tape build surface.\r\n\r\nThis really speeds up the platform leveling, and I was able to do the whole job in about 5 minutes. I also found that the adjustment changes significantly when the HBP is at 110C vs room temperature."
