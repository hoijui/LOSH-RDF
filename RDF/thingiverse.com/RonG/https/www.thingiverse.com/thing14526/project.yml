function: My grandson and I were up early this morning and he wanted to make a storage box for some of his things. A Thingiverse search didn't turn up anything that interested him, but then he noticed the burn hazard warning sticker on the TOM and decided on a pyramid shaped box. The OpenSCAD script just took a couple of minutes and after a quick look through the filament bin for color ideas it was time to hit the print button.
