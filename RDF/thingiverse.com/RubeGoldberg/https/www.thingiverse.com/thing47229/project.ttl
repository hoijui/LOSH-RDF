    okh:function """Power Stick can be used to power your own designs for dremels, electric toothbrushes (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47657), immersion blenders (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47690), fans, power screwdrivers (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47978), robots, handheld vacuums (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47946), and many more useful things! \r
\r
Power Stick is a simple way to add motion to your designs.  Simply enter the dimensions of any motor you have laying around and plug the power stick in to your design.\r
\r
Power Stick is a design that I hope will push the limits of printing useful things at home.  The idea is to standardize how makers like you can easily add motion to your creative projects.   Print it once and plug it in to all of your designs!\r
\r
The goal of Power Stick is the enable anyone to be able to easily print useful powered things at home. For the more handy makers, you can easily assemble PowerStick yourself. For the makers with less time, you can buy an assembled PowerStick off of your more handy friend!\r
\r
I hope that I can get some help with this idea because I don't actually have a printer myself to test it with.  Feel free to contact me with any suggestions on how to improve the design.  \r
\r
I am a design engineer by day, and well, by night too because that's what I enjoy doing. I believe home 3d printing could really be awesome if there was a standard for adding power to designs. I will be working on designs to go with the power stick and hopefully posting them soon.  I am particularly interested in trying to create a handheld vacuum that can be printed and possibly filtered with coffee filters. \r
\r
*Update\r
I've started making a collection of things that would be cool to use the Power Stick for.  I especially like the automated cat food dispenser.""" ;
