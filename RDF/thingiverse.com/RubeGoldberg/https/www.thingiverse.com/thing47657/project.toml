function = "This is a concept for an attachment for the Power Stick I designed that can turn a regular toothbrush into an electric toothbrush.  \r\n\r\nIt is a work in progress.  Feel free to send me feedback if you make one and I will update the design.\r\n\r\nI will look for some better gears of exactly the right diameter, pitch etc.  Feel free to suggest any that may already be available.\r\n\r\nI am working on some more attachments for the Power Stick so hopefully this is the first of many!\r\n\r\nRev - 1 - I lengthened the slot on part 6 to prevent the part from crashing with the pin in the slot."
