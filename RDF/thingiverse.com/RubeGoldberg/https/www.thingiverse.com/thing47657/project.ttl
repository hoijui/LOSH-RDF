\r
It is a work in progress.  Feel free to send me feedback if you make one and I will update the design.\r
\r
I will look for some better gears of exactly the right diameter, pitch etc.  Feel free to suggest any that may already be available.\r
\r
I am working on some more attachments for the Power Stick so hopefully this is the first of many!\r
\r
Rev - 1 - I lengthened the slot on part 6 to prevent the part from crashing with the pin in the slot.""" ;
