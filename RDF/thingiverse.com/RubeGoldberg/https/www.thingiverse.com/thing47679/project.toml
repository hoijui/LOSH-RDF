function = "This is a reduction gearbox for the Power Stick.  The goal is the eventually have several configurable options for gear ratios.  This gearbox should work well for many accessories I will be designing and uploading soon including a hex attachment to create a hand drill, a blade to create an immersion blender and anything else I can think up!    \r\n\r\nIt is a work in progress. I will be making some cleaner gearing here soon."
