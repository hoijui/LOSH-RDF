function = "These are some standard calipers with 1/16 and 1/4\" markings.  The markings are .4mm wide so someone let me know if they are printing well or not. I hope to upload these as a configurable model soon so you can select units.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress, feel free to send me suggestions for improvement!  I think the next step for these would be to add a dial indicator for increased precision.  I will start working on that as soon as I know they function well in their current state.\r\n\r\n**Update\r\nI fixed the tail end so that it now functions as a depth gauge."
