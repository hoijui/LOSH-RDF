\r
This is a work in progress, feel free to send me suggestions for improvement!  I think the next step for these would be to add a dial indicator for increased precision.  I will start working on that as soon as I know they function well in their current state.\r
\r
**Update\r
I fixed the tail end so that it now functions as a depth gauge.""" ;
