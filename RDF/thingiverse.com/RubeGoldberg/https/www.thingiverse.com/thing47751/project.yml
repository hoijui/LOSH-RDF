function: This is a concept for a ratcheting 1/4" drive.  There are two components, the handle with the teeth and the socket with the springs.  The idea is that the plastic on the springs will spring enough to create a ratcheting function.  Feel free to send feedback on improvements as this is a work in progress.  Once I know it functions as desired I will make it configurable and also make it so that the two pieces stay together.  Also, this design only tightens right now.
