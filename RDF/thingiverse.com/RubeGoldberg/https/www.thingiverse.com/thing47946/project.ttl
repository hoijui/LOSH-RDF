    okh:function """This is another attachment concept I've started for the Power Stick.  The idea is that the Power Stick snaps on the back and functions as the handle to the vacuum.  To filter the vacuum I have designed it so that you can open the two halves and lay a dryer sheet or some sort of filter between the two.  The mounting points should pierce the filter and hold it in place.\r
\r
This is a work in progress so feel free to send me ideas to make it better.  Not sure if it works, I am unable to print it, but I will continue to improve the design as I get feedback.\r
\r
Check out the Power Stick platform on my page for more details on what it is.""" ;
