function = "Here is 2.0 of a 1/4 Gearbox for the Power Stick. Improvements include:  gears that should mesh and work and better tolerances.  The size of the large gear forced it to hang out the size of the box so that will definitely be fixed in the next version.  I may need to rethink the size of the power stick given gear size limitations.  I don't want to make gear teeth too small to avoid printing resolution problems."
