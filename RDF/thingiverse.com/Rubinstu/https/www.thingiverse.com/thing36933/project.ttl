    okh:function """Model statue inspired by Robert Indiana's "Ahava" statue in Israel. That itself is a Hebrew version of his famous "Love" statue. \r
\r
This will be a gift to my wife for Chanukah, so don't talk to her about it until next week!\r
\r
To make the model, I took a graphic of the letters, then converted them to an SVG, which was then imported in Blender. From there, I extruded the SVG paths into solids and created the base. The Blender file is included so you can change it up.\r
\r
The STLs are in three parts - the main letters, the "leg" of the lower letter hey, and the base. \r
\r
On my BFB-3000, all parts were printed at 400%. Scale accordingly. Printed great in black ABS. No support needed.\r
\r
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Indiana for pictures and background.""" ;
