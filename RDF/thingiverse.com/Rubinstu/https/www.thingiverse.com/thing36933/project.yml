function: "Model statue inspired by Robert Indiana's \"Ahava\" statue in Israel. That itself is a Hebrew version of his famous \"Love\" statue. \r\n\r\nThis will be a gift to my wife for Chanukah, so don't talk to her about it until next week!\r\n\r\nTo make the model, I took a graphic of the letters, then converted them to an SVG, which was then imported in Blender. From there, I extruded the SVG paths into solids and created the base. The Blender file is included so you can change it up.\r\n\r\nThe STLs are in three parts - the main letters, the \"leg\" of the lower letter hey, and the base. \r\n\r\nOn my BFB-3000, all parts were printed at 400%. Scale accordingly. Printed great in black ABS. No support needed.\r\n\r\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Indiana for pictures and background."
