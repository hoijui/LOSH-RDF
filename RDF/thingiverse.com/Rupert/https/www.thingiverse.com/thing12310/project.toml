function = "Another spool holder that mounts horizontally (why fight gravity?). This ones fits my UltiMachine 5lb spool, which has a 39mm (1.5 inches) diameter hole. The OpenSCAD file is parametric in case it needs to be adapted for different spool types.\r\n\r\nThe STL file is unnecessarily large because I set the OpenSCAD accuracy parameter ($fn) stupidly high. Feel free to re-render using $fn = 60 for a smaller STL file."
