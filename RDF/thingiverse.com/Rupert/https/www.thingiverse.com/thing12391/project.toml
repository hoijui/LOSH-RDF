function = "A stamp in a case for embossing paper and card. The stamps are changeable with two examples included.\r\n\r\nThe top includes slots for storing the spare stamps, which also provide rigidity even when the skeinforge fill settings are low. For similar reasons the bottom includes \"pillars\" that help transmit the force evenly across the whole template area.\r\n\r\nThe design is in OpenSCAD and fully parametric including the size of the design area, the thickness of the base and templates, and the gap between the lid and the base, which should be based on the thickness of the rubber you use (see instructions below)."
