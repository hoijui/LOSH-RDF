\r
While Litho-Alan makes a wonderful window decal, he is really just a proof-of-concept that you could add to things like lampshades and candle holders. The nice thing about lithophanes is that you only need a black-and-white picture as the source, not a full 3D model.\r
\r
Craftsmen and artisans of the pre-industrial era would often personalize their work, perhaps with a picture of the patron who commissioned the piece. With 3D printing we are able to make just one of something and to tailor it specifically to one person.""" ;
