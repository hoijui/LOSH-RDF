function: "A child-safe saw for cutting out pumpkins for Halloween.\r\n\r\nIt was not entirely successful when printed in PLA as the blade snapped on the second pumpkin, but it does actually cut. It is a difficult balance between strength and cutting ability, but the model is parametric in case you want to try improving the design."
