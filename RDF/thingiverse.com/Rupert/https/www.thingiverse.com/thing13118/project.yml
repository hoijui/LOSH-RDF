function: "A cord pull for curtains and light switches. The OpenSCAD file is parametric so you can adjust the various dimensions to suit your needs. The example STL is a chunky 40mm tall, 25mm across, with a 3mm hole.\r\n\r\nI've finally got around to making the useful household objects I promised my wife!"
