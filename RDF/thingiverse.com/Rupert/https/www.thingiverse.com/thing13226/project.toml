function = "A set of stackable and nestable boxes decorated with shapes and letters.  \nWARNING: Objects smaller than 45mm are unsuitable for children under 3!  \nWARNING: Check the material you are using to print is safe for children!  \nWARNING: Ensure no loose parts or sharp edges once the part is printed!  \nThe boxes nest neatly inside one another and securely on top of each other in purpose made slots. Each box is cubic and 5mm bigger than the last. The sides are decorated with the alphabet, geometric shapes, Makerbot and RepRap logos, and the message I-LOVE-REPRAP-MAKERBOT.  \nThis design is loosely based on the Montessori pink tower. What other teaching aids could we make with our machines? What about a Makers4Schools movement?"
