function = "I took Nudel_P scad file and modified it for use with laser cutting acrylic with holes for a mk1 pcb heatbed, printrboard, and l-brackets for the corner support.  A notch was made in the corner for running wires from the top switches down to the base.\r\n\r\nImages shown still have the protective paper on them.\r\n\r\nl-brackets are from here:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2226\r\n\r\nMarking this work in progress until it is fully built.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 10-20-2012:\r\nIt is up and running (no longer in progress).  Ended up using particle board for the side pieces for extra stability from added weight.  The acrylic was too flimsy."
