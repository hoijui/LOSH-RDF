function: "My LM8UUs were sloppy on the drill rod so rather than trying to find another set of linear bearings with less slop, I just doubled them up.\r\n\r\nWith them in a pair on each rod, they have very little backlash (if not none).\r\n\r\nI'm using K\xC3\xBChling's (awesome) holders again, but the ones he designed for the X prusa ends."
