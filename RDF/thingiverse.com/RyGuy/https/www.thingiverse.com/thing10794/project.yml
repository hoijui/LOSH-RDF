function: "Yo, this is my 1st upload to Thingiverse (love this place!).  We still use multitudes of Motorola walkie-talkies called TalkAbout's that use a unique belt clip that is hard to track down, priced far too high and unfortunately break way too easily.  I sat down yesterday and designed my own clip using broken remains and my trusty cheap caliper.  I was excited when after my 4th proto print I had a functioning 3 piece kit that seems to be working wonderfully!  I wanted to try sharing it just incase someone else has an investment in these units and needs additional clips.  This kit includes the belt loop clip, plastic spring and sliding jacket that all snap together after printing and will keep your walkie close for dispatching your ever-so important RF communications (or just make it look like you have \"people\"). \r\n\r\nThis was printed from a TOM Mk6 plastruder running 1.75mm nuclear green filament equipped with an ABP"
