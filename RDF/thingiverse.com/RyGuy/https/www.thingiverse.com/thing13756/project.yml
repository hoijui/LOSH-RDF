function: If your like me you may have jumped in pretty hard right off the bat with additional MBI products such as the filament spindle boxes.  After running a few 2 pound spools through them on kitchen turn tables (lazy Susans, sorry to any Susan's reading this) it started to become a large pain de-stacking my bot and top spindle box just to get to the bottom box for a change out.  So I just wanted to jot down a few notes as I rigged my setup for quicker filament change outs as well as adapting the boxes for different filament vendor spools and sizes.
