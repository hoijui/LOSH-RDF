If you use SU you gotta try it out! I attached the tool suite to this thing \"SKMtools20110225.zip\" just dump it into your plugins folder in SU and follow the directions from the above URL!\r\n\r\nOh, and for those making solids in SketchUp you really need the ruby script called \"Solid Inspector\". It makes chasing manifold issues 200 times easier in SU! Pick it up here: http://forums.sketchucation.com/viewtopic.php?f=323&t=30504"
