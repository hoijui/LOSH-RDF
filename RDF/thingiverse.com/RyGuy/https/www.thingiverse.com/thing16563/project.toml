function = "- Got a Mom?\r\n\r\n- Does your Mom have a desk?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you answered \"Yes\" to the above questions you may want to print this.\r\n\r\nThis is another Faja/Daja project.  My 3yr old daughter saw a picture of Mom's new cubicle system at work and said \"it looks real sad\" so we talked about making something special to sit on her desk that she could also use.  30min in Sketchup, 4.5hrs print time and we are ready to deliver some ABS joy to Mom's desk!  I told my daughter that I would be able to give this to my Mom (Grandma) as well and she doubled in excitement making sure I would tell Grandma that she helped make it too!\r\n\r\n** bmsweb alerted me that his Mom is a Mum, and Mum's count too! **\r\n \r\n\r\nLove Ya Mom!"
