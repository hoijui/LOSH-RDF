function: "Yo,\r\n\r\nDo you have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9\" or 10.1\" tablet??  If so here is a full featured docking solution!\r\n\r\nAt work we bought a fleet of 8.9 LTE Tab's and I immediately began creation of a dock that would work with a naked unit or with a TPU case on it.\r\n\r\nEach dock has an adapter locking center channel and cable tunnel for the 30 pin power/data cable.  I included 2 40mm unique dowels so you can easily slide the unit apart for addition and removal of the cable.  The unit holds your Tab at a 20 degree angle perfect for desk usage or next to the bed.  I widened the stance with the rear wedges so you can rest assured there will be no tipping even if your a hardcore screen basher.  There are also dual front and rear speaker ports so you can mega jam even when docked with the 8.9!\r\n\r\nI have uploaded 2 different solutions that work on each tablet variant (not physically tested on the 10.1 but the qualifying dimensions are the same):\r\n\r\n1.) A standard sized dock that minimizes plastic used and print duration.  This dock allows you to grip the side of the Tab in the dock and easily use a thumb keyboard without pulling it from the dock! \r\n\r\n2.) A jumbo dock that goes almost to the edge of the 8.9 and looks like a dock that you might buy at a retailer (or at least I like to think so...).\r\n\r\nAll docks pictured with logos were on my beta units only and all uploaded docks are free of any branding. \r\n\r\n**I have also attached my Sketchup master for your modding pleasures.**"
