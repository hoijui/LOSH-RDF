function: "Anyone who has ever owned a crock-pot knows that using one is a high energy event that can easily lead to knob destruction making frantic temperature selections between Off, Low and High.  One can get caught up in the massive dial selections while mentally salivating over the to-be-crocked feast.\r\n\r\nOr so I'm told.\r\n\r\nThis knob was to replace a broken one my parents brought me, they said it worked perfectly and sent me a picture...\r\n\r\nCrock on I suppose."
