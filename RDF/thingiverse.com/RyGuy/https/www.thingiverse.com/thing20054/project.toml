function = "Yo,\r\n\r\nThis is my attempt to build a low cost 4 servo Arduino Uno controlled bipedal robot that is framed with inexpensive 3D printed â€œI Bracesâ€x9d; that can hold a standard servo and interconnect with additional braces to form various modular structures. \r\n\r\nMy goal in this project was to:\r\n\r\nA. Show my 3yr old daughter that you can make anything you put your mind to!\r\nB. Not break the bank (wife mandated)\r\nC. Only run on 4 servos (to start with)\r\nD. Stand >= 10â€x9d tall\r\nE. Leave room for upgrades/reworks without scrapping parts\r\nF. Give live commands to the biped\r\nG. Communicate wirelessly (I have lots of extra Android phones laying around)\r\n\r\nWatch it in action @:\r\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/MegaPed/"
