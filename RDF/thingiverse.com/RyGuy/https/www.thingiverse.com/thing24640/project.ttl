    okh:function "The wife recently got the Samsung Galaxy Note in place of her iPhone and immediately wanted to case it in a wallet style case as she aimed to carry all her financial ends along with the Note making it the primary item to pull from her mini purse.  The issue came when time to charge; she didn't want to just lay her Note on the desktop at work or home as she wanted to keep using it while charging.  We looked at docks but they all were for the naked Note and I didn't like the idea of her needing to pull the device in/out of the case over and over each day.  What to do, what to do, well you design and print your own!  Over the course of a few days I designed this 3D printable case that allows the Note to charge/sync with the factory adapter, hold the stylus in a readily accessible location and hold the Note while still in a nice leather folding case!" ;
