function = "This is a printable (paper!) sheet for verifying X/Y steps/mm settings.\r\n\r\nEach line has tick marks every 1cm. There are 12 lines at 0.5 degree increments so you don't have to bother lining it up exactly with your axes - just tape down within 6 degrees of square and move on the non-test axis until you find the line that's parallel to the test axis movement."
