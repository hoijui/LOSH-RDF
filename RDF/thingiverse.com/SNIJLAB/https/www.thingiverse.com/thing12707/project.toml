function = "Recently we discoverd a really nice technique that makes wood flexible. This is so cool we want to share it with you!\r\n\r\nWe designed wooden booklets that use this feature. Theyâ€™re made from a beautiful birch plywood and are finished with a clear varnish. The hard wooden cover can be opened fully to the back side for comfortable holding. A tiny clamp inside, made from the same material, holds a standard A7 writing block.\r\n\r\nThe booklets come in a horizontal and vertical version.\r\nActually they not only look cool, it shows exactly what we think digital production is all about. By using manufacturing techniques like this it is possible to make all product features in a single production step and in one material. This cuts down production effort and logistics and makes for a beautifully simple product. Because a laser cutter is a fairly common tool products like this could be manufactured locally, all over the world. By working from sheet materials the products can also be flat-packed, saving even more resources and costs on shipping.\r\n\r\nFor us this means we can make everything in-house and we donâ€™t need to produce in big quantities to make it affordable. This is really the power of digital manufacturing and personal fabrication. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.snijlab.nl"
