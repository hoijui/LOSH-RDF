function = "This is a small eating UTENSIL that is a SPOON, a FORK, and a BUTTER KNIFE all in one. It is comprised of 2 parts. It can SLIDE longer for EASY handling. Square covers can also be available to cover each end of the device to keep the utensil ends clean.\r\nI see this device replacing the unnecessary use of multiple objects at the dinner table. One object is all you need. And if you only use one item then cleaning up will be a breeze.\r\nI also see this item being used in areas around the world where communities don't have the means to acquire eating utensils. If this can be produced in a monetarily efficient process then a number of these can be given to these communities where it can be used for a number of years and diminish the waste from the use of other temporary plastics."
