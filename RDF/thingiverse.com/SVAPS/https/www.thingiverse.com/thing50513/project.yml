function: "I wanted a tensioner that would attach to the bed using the supplied two screws and that was easy to mount and which would enable tightening of the belt without tools and without risk of damaging the belt, as with some of the tensioners where the belt is tensioned with a screw directly on the belt or where the belt has to turn a sharp corner.  \nAlso I wanted the thing not to be too large or require too much ABS.  \n\nAdded an STL for a T2.5 belt - I have not tested this, so please report any misbehavior."
