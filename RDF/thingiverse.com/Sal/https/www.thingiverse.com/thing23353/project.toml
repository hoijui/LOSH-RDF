function = "This is a spare fork for the excellent toy \"Bruder Linde H30D Forklift\".\r\n\r\nAfter some months of intensive play my son broke one of the removeable forks. Immediate solution: Buy another forklift. Now, a year later when both toys are still in use despite only two forks out of four still intact, I got a 3d-printer. So, here is the vital spare part in reprap compatible format!"
