function: "(Check out the derivative thing which I find works better)\r\n\r\nTrying to sort out the mess of cables on my desk. The name is a reflection on the shape of the hub, which is the result of trying to maximize the bending radius of the cable.\r\n\r\nOf course the OpenSCAD sources are fully parametric but comments are lacking...\r\n\r\nUpdate: Updated scad file before first print to reduce overhangs on the lid.\r\n\r\nUpdate2: Made two of these spools now, and not entirely satisfied... This design is too weak to work well with less flexible cables. Also, unwinding is a pain because the cable tends to unwind inside the spool making it jam. Next, I will try a detachable lid that snaps over the cable."
