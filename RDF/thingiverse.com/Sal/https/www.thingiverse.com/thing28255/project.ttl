    okh:function """This is a redesign of the ancestor thing to improve the stability when winding less flexible cords like cheap usb-cables. This version has a lid with unbroken top surface and a support bearing for the hub. Unfortunately, this requires the lid to be detachable so I had to redesign the bearing for the lower rim as well. Here is the weakest point; The cable opening breaks the lower rim bearing of the lid. However, this also results in a nice snap fit for the lid. A simple modification could remove this weakness but this would reduce usability. I think the current design is a good compromise.\r
\r
Update: Added 1.5 m version stls and scad script with larger dimensions for the snap thingy. I had some issues with the lid popping off... The new scad script is probably better for all dimensions!""" ;
