function: "An OpenSCAD script that generates link chain designed to print without support or post assembly.  \n\nUpdate! New name, cleaned up script. Tossed out all old scad and stls.  \n\nUpdate 2, May 2013. Reworked the script to generate clean link geometry. TODO (low prio): Make the code as clean as the geometry...  \n\nChain links are 22 x 12(15) mm with a 3.5 mm diameter cross-section. (Straight chain is 12 mm wide, others 15 mm) These dimensions are easily modified in the scad file or through customizer, but make sure to check that the links do not intersect!"
