What can I say its the man, Bill Murray. I am still figuring out how to work with meshes in blender, I also used the super awesome bitmap tracing in inkspcape wich allows you to make "grouped" vector files it basically traces the different color gradients and creates a stacked .SVG it would be cool to use multiple vectors from the same image stacked on top of each other to provide even more depth and detail (I am working on one of those now) This BFM plate is only one layer with a plain background. I was so stoked on it I couldnt wait to post it. Does any body have any advice on joining meshes in Blender so that all of the internal geometry is forgotten? there seems to be artifacts left over in the base plate where the overlap of the two layers happens. I can see this as being a really cool way of printing portriats of people, you could use multiple layers and multiple colors for even more awesomness.""" ;
