function = "After I made a few Che things, some people where giving me a hard time based on who Che actually was. After researcing the topic I found it very interesting that Che's face as a pop icon has outweighted who he really is. I thought it would be ironic to use a face that is less recognizable, but agreeable by all as a bad person. I chose Benito Mussolini the Italian facist. Kind of a play on Iconic images and the seperation from original content that happened with the famous Che face."
