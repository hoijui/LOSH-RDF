function = "I have found that the Home Depot sourced 10-24 nuts and 4-40 nuts are poor replacements for M5 and M3, respectfully.  I have enlarged the nut traps and the z anti-lash fittings to better fit these sizes.  I am uploading this to give proper respect to the work done before me on these amazing parts, as well as to possibly help others finding themselves in the same situation.\r\n\r\nI also added a beefy z endstop adjustment holder, because I wanted a beefier looking one than the ones I have seen uploaded."
