I have enlarged the nut traps and the z anti-lash fittings to better fit these sizes.  I am uploading this to give proper respect to the work done before me on these amazing parts, as well as to possibly help others finding themselves in the same situation.\r

I also added a beefy z endstop adjustment holder, because I wanted a beefier looking one than the ones I have seen uploaded.""" ;
