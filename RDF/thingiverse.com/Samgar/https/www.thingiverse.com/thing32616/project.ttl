\r
Since bowden tubes tend to be a higher maintence item, I found the dissasembly and reassembly of the extruder end of the bowden was a pain.  I though about how the design could be improved and came up with a number of bad ideas.  Finally, I looked at my groovemount extruder on my full sized prusa and thought that I could do the same for my huxley.  I have been using a special wades body that used M3 holes and screws to hold the groove slots of the hot end inside the wades body itself. (see designs similar to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27054 )  I have simply borrowed from that design and retained my huxley bowden tube in a similar manner with this design.""" ;
