Update 27th April 2013 - Printer's working well - will add more photos soon. Along with updating the rest of this page.  

This is a 3D printer I'm designing and building.  

Frame - Aluminium Extrusion from 8020.net its a 1.5" wide profile drilled with holes for M8 or imperial bolts. They connect with aluminium inserts and general hardware, washers and nylock nuts etc. For my first Frame I'm actually using an etch spray primer and satin black paint.  

Linear motion - X and Y are Pulley driven with Z being high quality stainless threaded bar. All 3 axis are guided by LM10UU bearings and 10mm stainless rod.  

I also hope to add an LCD display and possibly a tablet pc/ipad mount on top for the interface.""" ;
