function: "With Arthur's Day coming up, a Guinness themed coaster. \r\nIt's the Guinness harp logo extruded 5mm in height to be used as a coaster.\r\nIt's my first Thing, productive feedback will be appreciated.\r\nPlease publish pictures if you print this.\r\n\r\nThingiverse seems to be unable to render the part for preview, but it appears just fine in Blender, MeshLab etc.\r\nUpdate: Seems SolidWorks eDrawings exports STL in meters and not mm. \r\nUploaded Guinness_Harp_Coaster_Large with the correct dimension and orientation."
