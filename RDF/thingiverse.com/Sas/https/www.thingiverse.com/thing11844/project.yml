function: "A 12 piece 3D puzzle of a cylinder I have at home.\r\nCreated in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nComplete set should print on a 200 by 200 bed.\r\n\r\nIn the future I plan to figure out how to alter piece_large to be printable without support.\r\n\r\nIt might be necessary to make some alterations for the parts to fit directly from printing, but they should fit after some cleaning.\r\n\r\nI don't have a printer yet so I did not print this."
