function: "This is a pair of replacement parts (bones if you will) for a singing fish toy.\r\n\r\nOverall project is at http::www.SashimiTabernacleChoir.org\r\n\r\nI don't have a 3D printer yet to try these out, but I thought I'd go ahead and make some OpenScad models of some of the parts that break most frequently. This is the first such model."
