Thank you, AlexEnglish!\r\nI did not believe it at first, but it really does fit tightly.\r\n\r\nWith this you can take photos through any telescope, as long as you reach focus (No problem with a 102/1300 Maksutov, could not get in far enough on a 76/300 newton-dobson though).\r\n\r\nThese adapters usually cost â‚¬20 ($28) from a telescope shop, and this probably 5% or less, depending on material, support and setting.\r\n\r\nThe Mak does have a T2 mount, but for using a barlow, this is a quick and inexpensive solution! :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nNeeds fixing in the future:\r\nSpacer, so tightening the tube into the focuser is easier (now the focuser screws are pressing directly against the EF mount disc)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Sidenote for the DailyEarring project: It'll be back. Sorry for the hiatus. In the mean time, enjoy the printer live-cam at http://up.no-ip.org:8888 untill my site is back up :-) )"
