function = "I made several number buttons for my fiancee's needle roll.\r\nThe initial plan was to print some buttons with the different sizes for each \r\n\r\nneedle (3mm, 3.25mm, 12mm etc. etc.).\r\n\r\nTo make the buttons small with the number still printable, I worked on several \r\n\r\ndesigns.\r\nThe decimal place as pie-chart, the number as dice pips buttons, dots, bars etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the different designs but we ended up using a simple number (as it is \r\n\r\npretty obvious which needles will be next the button (.25mm right, .75mm left) and \r\n\r\ninbetween (.5mm).\r\n\r\nPersonally I really like the dice / piechart number combination."
