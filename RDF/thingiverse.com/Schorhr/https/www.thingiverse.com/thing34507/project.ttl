\r
We used sheet metal to trigger the opto-endstops. It was difficult to adjust and the sheet metal cuts through wire insulation when they get tangled up...\r
\r
This is nowhere perfect, but allows to adjust both position and stopping point.\r
\r
The earlier version used a ballpen spring, but it works with just as fine with a (M4) screw and a nut if the parts fit snug.\r
\r
The various holders can be fixed with M4 Screws and the round part goes to a M8 Screw on the chasis of the Mendel-Variant we built.\r
\r
Please excuse the bad pictures, I just took them with a cellphone which is not very good ad close-ups.""" ;
