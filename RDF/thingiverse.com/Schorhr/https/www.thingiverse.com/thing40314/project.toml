function = "Thingiverse is great. With flouSH's part I did not have to start from scratch. Unfortunately the PP3DP UP has different tolerances and print properties, the first ones where to loose and the teeth did not turn out well. \r\nThere you have a great example for reprap/slic3r VS closed source: While the later will usually produce great and repeatable results, there's just not much you can do when something just won't work with the limited settings available.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in the Sketchup SKP file is a (rough but close enough) 3D model of the servo and the inner gear setup, as I could not find something similar. I did not have the digital caliper handy, so it's not very precise, but good enough if you plan on tinkering with a servo and (like me) do not want to take it apart twenty times for your sketches.\r\n\r\n###UPDATE 1 #### JAN 5 2013\r\nI modeled the servo arm (File \"servoarm.skp\"/\"Servoarms.stl\", if you want to print one, you may want to try the great thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28566 if you are looking for printed servo arms)\r\n\r\n###UPDATE 2  #### JAN 5 2013\r\nI added the servo topper coupling, which will sit ontop of the four-arm and does not require aditional screws (perhaps a longer one though!)"
