function = "I designed a larger dual head 3D printer using Generation 4 electronics from MBI, I call it affectionately TOM-BOY.  It took me some time but I could not sleep unitl I designed a printer that was larger, accurate and reliable.  At least I think it will be?  I designed it using standard DFM policies using common parts through out.  The design uses all dual NEMA11 Non-Captive screw drives on each axis.  The screw I selected will give .001mm acuracy and 400mm in travel. The print area is right at 270mm+ in all directions and a bit more in the z direction.\r\nThe Hot End is also customed designed with new dual gear drive, and is set up for 1.75mm material.\r\n\r\nOther Features:\r\n*Inverted electronics bay so you can get to all electronics\r\n*Plastic scerw locks so acrlyc will not crack\r\n*Fully inclosed with door access\r\n*Feeders for filiment spools\r\n*HBP is atached by magnets for easy access,service and leveling\r\n*All parts used to construct each axis can be printed on a TOM\r\n*Gen4 Interface board and display bult into design"
