    okh:function """After reading several posts and seeing melted connectors I investigated the problem and designed a new connector to fix this problem for my TOM.  I first want to make clear this new connetor fixes the melting and heat problem, but I am in no way pionting fault at MBI because I personaly design several prodcuts each year and so far I have never made one perfect yet!  Mybe some day, I just wish I had a following to help tweak my products!\r
\r
Problem:  The problem with the connector that is shipped is not that it can not handle the current but the connector is not rated to operate at 100+ degrees Celcius, it is only rated at 75 degrees.  What is happeing is when the connector gets to those high temeratures the female receptical is losing it spring on the male pin. FYI the connector is rated at 7 amps at 75 degrees Celcius, at least the molex version has those specks.  When it loses tension it gets hot at that very piont and cause those melted pictures i am seeing.\r
\r
Solution:  I designed a part in Solid Edge ST3 that use a two parts form Mill-Max that are rated to operate at those high temperatures.  The Mill-Max parts are rate for 11.5 amps and will operate at 150 degrees celcius.  FYI they do have a part that will go even higher if need!  Any way I designed a conector to hold 6 of these parts. Two of the connections are only need for the high current but I did them all so it would have nice mating strengh.  I just ordered 12 samples of each form there website for free!
