function: "After much pain trying to level with springs and to to hold the tolerance the TOM can print. I designed in ST3 a platform leveler that can level at easy to .001 of an inch and less.  This design allows you to get to all four corners and easly and to ajust them to the right height and lock them into place.\r\n\r\nI uploaded STP files of all the parts for those who have requested a file they can change or manipulate. STP and IGES files are pretty much universial in the 3D world so most should be able to read them in. I designed the parts in Solid Edge ST3 so the virgin files are done in this. If someone needs a different format send me a note and I will do my best to help. \r\n\r\nUpdate: Please use JinxTheRabbit's version of the HBP Leveler Part1 A.stl part it prints much better than mine! Please down load his version at \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13023 he added a raft to the support and it works great!\r\n\r\nNote: I added IGES file of complete HBP assembly so folks can have access to all the parts and change them to there liking."
