function = "After having to relevel my platfrom after severla builds due the pressure applied getting parts off.  Also being fixed to the TOM makes it hard to get Kapton Tape without air bubbles.  So I decided to make the HBP so I could take it on and off without messing up the Z height.  What i did is use a previous printed leveler I posted before  buhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9094 ) I added four (4)flat head 3mm screws and four (4) super magnets JB weled into the wood plat form.  It works great maybe some one else would like it so i posted it. \r\n\r\nI added the a STEP file of the complete design for those who want to modify it for changes.\r\n\r\nScott"
