    okh:function """This is part of a larger project I'll be publishing here as I go along.  This is a mounting for a Nokia N900 to fit in a Jeep Wrangler.  I'd expect the parts may be useful in other situations as well.  If you wanted to mount something besides an N900 on your Jeep, or if you wanted to mount your N900 to something other than a Jeep, you should be off to a good start here.\r
\r
It consists of two parts; a clamp that fits in a hole on the Jeep's dashboard, and a frame that holds an N900.  The N900 frame can be printed in a 'locking' or 'non-locking' version; the locking back prevents the phone from being removed from the frame, and the locking front prevents the keyboard from being /closed/.  The non-locking versions do not have these limitations.  \r
\r
The idea is that I can bolt this into the Jeep pretty securely, so it will at least take some time and ingenuity to steal it, even if the Jeep has no doors and windows.\r
\r
WIP WHY:  Owe you some photos of it in the Jeep.\r
\r
UPDATE:  Still haven't put it in the Jeep (working on the software) but I did revise the case slightly, raising the lower two circles and widening the gap for the base a little.  I did not update the -nolock files.""" ;
