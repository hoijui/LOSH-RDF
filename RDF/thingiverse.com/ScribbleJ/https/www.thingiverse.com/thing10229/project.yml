function: "These webcams are cheap stuff that are available under a wide variety of labels.  They also work easier and more consistently than the much more expensive big-name cameras I have.  \r\n\r\nThis is a bracket for the camera.  You'll need to design some additional part to secure it to whatever you intend the camera to be on.  Some hot glue will make sure the cables stay where they belong."
