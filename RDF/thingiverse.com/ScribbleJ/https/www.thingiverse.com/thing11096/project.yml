function: "THIS DESIGN IS /FULLY/ PARAMETRIC.  You can specify the angle of the bend in the part from 0-90, the radius of the bends, placement of holes, etc, without having to read through into the nasty, nasty code.  So if you can think of any other uses for this basic shape, have at it!\r\n\r\nIf you have been following my custom firmware for Thing O Matic and Repraps, you know that it supports hostless printing using an SD reader, keypad, and LCD.\r\n\r\nhttp://reprap.org/wiki/Sjfw\r\n \r\nI designed a minimal mounting bracket for the keypad and LCD so they can be held in the hand, set on the desk next to the printer, or hooked over the front threaded rods.\r\n\r\nWIP WHY:  Haven't actually printed it yet; too big to print on the ToM and the Prusa Z axis is getting replaced before I print again there."
