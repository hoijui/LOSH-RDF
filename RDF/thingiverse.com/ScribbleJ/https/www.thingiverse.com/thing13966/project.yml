function: My nephew, who is almost 3, has his favorite stuffed animal in the world, a lion named George.  Well, doesn't have at the moment; he left it at my house, it fell into my time machine, and seems to have returned quite successfully from the Crusades.  I'll have to read through my history books to see if I can find any mention of what George might have done while he was away.
