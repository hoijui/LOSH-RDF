function: "This is a DLP projector-based resin printer that can make very fine 3D prints in record time.  \r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress.  Today I plan to begin actual experiments with the resin.  \r\n\r\nI believe the basic design I am producing here is very suitable, however, the details of the design need changes in almost every part to be ideal.  Most importantly, the vat should probably be much shorter, but the whole thing could be made significantly smaller.\r\n\r\nI am currently using resin from \r\nBucktown Polymers: \r\n\r\nhttp://bucktownpolymers.com/\r\n\r\n(You might notice their price for resin is cheaper than some current PLA prices, by volume)\r\n\r\nA2Sheds has provided a page with a few helpful resources, as well as the beginnings of his own DLP project:\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/lemoncurry/wiki/main\r\n\r\nThis is very much a work in progress.  Expect more photos and videos to come.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to my flickr site documenting this project:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/13723140@N04/sets/72157629564335469/\r\n\r\nVideo of resin cure here:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/UVDN2xq575A\r\n\r\nNext steps:  Experiment with resin.  Create working software stack.\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:  Vat is too tall/big, glass may be too weak/thin.  Vat probbaly needs a nonstick coating, like silicone or PTFE.  Z Axis range is 5\", vat is 5\", so Z stage cannot quite clear the vat. A2Sheds recommends a heated vat to 50c so the resin flows better..."
