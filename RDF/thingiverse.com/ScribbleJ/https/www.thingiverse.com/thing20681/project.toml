function = "A simple set of tesselated M.C. Escher fish.  Martin Raynsford (link below) provided the original fish DXF, but I have added a frame sized for 42 fish.\r\n\r\nMartin's suggestion is to stain some wood light and some dark and cut two different colors of fish for neat patterning.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to Martin's blog entry with the original design.\r\n\r\nhttp://msraynsford.blogspot.com/2012/03/escher-fish.html\r\n\r\nHere's a link to one of the photos on my Flickr; browsing around will reveal additional photos of the process I did not post here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/13723140@N04/6893876136/in/photostream\r\n\r\nAnd here's a video of the laser cutter cutting two fish, my favorite part is seeing the part drop when the cut is completed:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs1zGo-hFho\r\n\r\n\"One Art Please!\" - Zoidberg."
