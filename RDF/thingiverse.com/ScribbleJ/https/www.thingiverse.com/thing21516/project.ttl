\r
Eventually I would plan to design a whole bunch of little silly things with holes for a magnet in them and roll them all up.  \r
\r
In the meantime, you'll find a Prince of All Cosmos, a Katamari, and two pentagons sized for pickup up as the first and second layers of your Katamari... or for use in making an interesting art peice.... or for use as a template to get the idea of the size to make things to be picked up first and second.\r
\r
More photos to come later, probably!""" ;
