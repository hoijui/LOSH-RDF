function: "This is probably a thing that's best designed for a 3D printer, but I thought this seemed like a fun way to use up scraps of uncut stuff, and the perfect way to start to learn to use LibreCAD:  http://librecad.org/cms/home.html (Which is excellent!)\r\n\r\nEventually I would plan to design a whole bunch of little silly things with holes for a magnet in them and roll them all up.  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you'll find a Prince of All Cosmos, a Katamari, and two pentagons sized for pickup up as the first and second layers of your Katamari... or for use in making an interesting art peice.... or for use as a template to get the idea of the size to make things to be picked up first and second.\r\n\r\nMore photos to come later, probably!"
