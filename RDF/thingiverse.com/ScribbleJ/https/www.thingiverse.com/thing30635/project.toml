Some examples:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.reuters.com/video/2012/02/27/3d-printed-prosthetics-offer-amputees-ne?videoId=230878689\r\n\r\nhttp://news.yahoo.com/wounded-eagle-gets-3d-printed-beak-212747462.html\r\n\r\nWe thought it was about time this same level of medical care was offered to stuffed animals.  \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSubject is a 15-year old stuffed pig, whose right arm was lost to a vicious animal in a horrifying accident.\r\n\r\nDoctors carefully measured the pig's left arm to create a duplicate that would be virtually identical to the original limb in fit and function.\r\n\r\nBecause the hospital has a Prusa Reprap 3D Printer on hand, the doctors were able to design and 3D print a prosthetic in no time at all, and now the pig is once again able to perform all the activites it enjoyed before the vicious attack claimed its original arm.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nGuide to Photos:\r\n\r\n1 & 2: The patient as initially admitted to the clinic.  Note the missing arm has been inexpertly bandaged by a previous doctor.\r\n\r\n3: This photograph of the 3D printer creating the prosthetic illustrates how we have filled the interior of the prosthetic with 'plastic stuffing' in order to simulate the pig's original limb.\r\n\r\n4+: It's a stunning replica of his original limb; one can hardly notice it is artificial.  It retains all the function of the original limb. \r\n\r\nFinal Photo: Complete success means our patient is able to re-integrate into his previous lifestyle.  He can now pass for a normal stuffed pig, without being ostracized for being different.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nLink to the flickr:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/13723140@N04/sets/72157631557873975/with/7996231007/"
