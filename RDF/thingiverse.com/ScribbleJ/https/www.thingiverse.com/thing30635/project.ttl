We thought it was about time this same level of medical care was offered to stuffed animals.  \r
\r

\r
Subject is a 15-year old stuffed pig, whose right arm was lost to a vicious animal in a horrifying accident.\r
\r
Doctors carefully measured the pig's left arm to create a duplicate that would be virtually identical to the original limb in fit and function.\r
\r
Because the hospital has a Prusa Reprap 3D Printer on hand, the doctors were able to design and 3D print a prosthetic in no time at all, and now the pig is once again able to perform all the activites it enjoyed before the vicious attack claimed its original arm.\r

\r
Guide to Photos:\r
\r
1 & 2: The patient as initially admitted to the clinic.  Note the missing arm has been inexpertly bandaged by a previous doctor.\r
\r
3: This photograph of the 3D printer creating the prosthetic illustrates how we have filled the interior of the prosthetic with 'plastic stuffing' in order to simulate the pig's original limb.\r
\r
4+: It's a stunning replica of his original limb; one can hardly notice it is artificial.  It retains all the function of the original limb. \r
\r
Final Photo: Complete success means our patient is able to re-integrate into his previous lifestyle.  He can now pass for a normal stuffed pig, without being ostracized for being different.\r
