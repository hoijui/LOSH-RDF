function: "A friend of mine wants to try printing out a drill bit for what he says is called \"Engine-turning, also known as jeweling or damascening.\"  I dunno if ABS plastic is up to the job, but from what I understand it basically involves gluing a scotch-brite pad onto a flat round drill bit, and then using it to buff a part.  So maybe it'll work fine? \r\n\r\n\r\nMostly it was an excuse for me to get more OpenSCAD experience.  Simple idea means simple script means I can do it!"
