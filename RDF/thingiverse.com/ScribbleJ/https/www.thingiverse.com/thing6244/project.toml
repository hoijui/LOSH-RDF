function = "The Thing-O-Matic gets kind of hard to light externally, since one side is completely closed off.  I remembered this little ring of LEDs I'd purchased a long time ago for another project, and as luck would have it, it exactly fits the wooden extruder opening on the ToM.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to the exact light I am using:\r\nhttp://www.dealextreme.com/p/t10-24-led-white-light-car-angel-eye-80mm-diameter-26001\r\n\r\nThis light is SO BRIGHT it lights the entire chamber, but the EXTREME INTENSENESS of it just made my camera take horrible photos of the lights themselves when on.  So I took some off, too.\r\n\r\nYou can see my power switch is just taped to the corner of my 'bot; if I were more clever with design I'd make a little housing for it.  Maybe someone wants to offer some aid."
