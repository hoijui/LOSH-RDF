    okh:function """The Thing-O-Matic gets kind of hard to light externally, since one side is completely closed off.  I remembered this little ring of LEDs I'd purchased a long time ago for another project, and as luck would have it, it exactly fits the wooden extruder opening on the ToM.\r
\r
Here's a link to the exact light I am using:\r

\r
This light is SO BRIGHT it lights the entire chamber, but the EXTREME INTENSENESS of it just made my camera take horrible photos of the lights themselves when on.  So I took some off, too.\r
\r
You can see my power switch is just taped to the corner of my 'bot; if I were more clever with design I'd make a little housing for it.  Maybe someone wants to offer some aid.""" ;
