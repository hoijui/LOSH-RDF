\r
I couldn't just extrude the original .DXF in OpenSCAD, so I sat down and took precise measurements and created my own replica instead.\r
\r
Completely parametric, if you need to adjust any of the dimensions yourself, but this does include a perfect set of dimensions and boltholes, which I'll be applying to the MK5 Wade's-style tensioner shortly.\r
\r
Marked WIP because it's the official home of the Dual-Extruder mount .SCAD.""" ;
