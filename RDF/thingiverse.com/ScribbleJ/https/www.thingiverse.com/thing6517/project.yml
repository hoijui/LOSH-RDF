function: "I needed this hole pattern for a dual-extruder mount:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6632 \r\n\r\nI couldn't just extrude the original .DXF in OpenSCAD, so I sat down and took precise measurements and created my own replica instead.\r\n\r\nCompletely parametric, if you need to adjust any of the dimensions yourself, but this does include a perfect set of dimensions and boltholes, which I'll be applying to the MK5 Wade's-style tensioner shortly.\r\n\r\nMarked WIP because it's the official home of the Dual-Extruder mount .SCAD."
