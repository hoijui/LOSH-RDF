\r
I'm sure there's other scripts like this out there, so here's what makes mine cooler than theirs:\r
\r
* I made it!\r
* It's ANIMATED!  Yes, OpenSCAD has an animation option, and this set will take advantage of it.  It seems like Thingiverse may not render a GIF though, so here's a link to a copy:  http://scribblej.com/wadesgears.gif (obviously, that's animated through 1 gear length so it's only 5 frames).\r
* I made it!\r
* The perfect companion to: Parametric Tensioner: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6492\r
* I made that, too!\r
* Goes great with: Stepper Motor Mount http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6549\r
* I made it!\r
\r
\r
... that's about all I got, really.  Based loosely on TheRuttmeister's excellent herringbone gear set here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5795\r
\r
THANKS to the entire crowd on IRC Freenode in #reprap, #makerbot, and #makergearv2.\r
\r
SPECIAL THANKS to GregFrost for his involute gears script and some special handholding while I was writing this.""" ;
