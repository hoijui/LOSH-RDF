function: "This is an OpenSCAD script for the generation of a stepper motor gear set, to your exacting specifications.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's other scripts like this out there, so here's what makes mine cooler than theirs:\r\n\r\n* I made it!\r\n* It's ANIMATED!  Yes, OpenSCAD has an animation option, and this set will take advantage of it.  It seems like Thingiverse may not render a GIF though, so here's a link to a copy:  http://scribblej.com/wadesgears.gif (obviously, that's animated through 1 gear length so it's only 5 frames).\r\n* I made it!\r\n* The perfect companion to: Parametric Tensioner: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6492\r\n* I made that, too!\r\n* Goes great with: Stepper Motor Mount http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6549\r\n* I made it!\r\n\r\n\r\n... that's about all I got, really.  Based loosely on TheRuttmeister's excellent herringbone gear set here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5795\r\n\r\nTHANKS to the entire crowd on IRC Freenode in #reprap, #makerbot, and #makergearv2.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS to GregFrost for his involute gears script and some special handholding while I was writing this."
