function: "The drill jig this is a derivative of is PURE GENIUS and I love it.  I've been working on some parametric filament drive plans, that will use a hobbed bolt, so that part is just what I need.\r\n\r\nBut there's one problem.  My scripts let me determine my bolt length rather precisely, and part tolerances... and to make a long story short, if you want to hob at bolt at the very furthest possible point so there's only room for a nut and no bolt extending beyond it, it's not possible in this jig, because of the way the bearings are held out with a bit of plastic...\r\n\r\nIf this writeup is horrible, it's because I've been up all hours and I'm just releasing this so I don't forget to later.  And to fill time while I wait for the neighborhood to wake up before I make all the noise involved in hobbing a bolt."
