This one has a keypad.  Even with that, you can probably squeak in just under $20 for all the parts.\r
\r
CURRENTLY DOES:\r
* Temperature Monitoring Screen\r
* Scrollable Error/Other Logging Screen\r
* SD Card File Selection and PRINT QUEUE\r
* Yes, queued up prints from SD Card files... Almost makes me want to put my ABP back on.  Not even RepG will do this.\r
* Print Queue Management: delete, add, start, stop, abort current (not even RepG will do that! - it just resets the system).\r
* Control Menu: Select screens from friendly menu, abort print, reset printer, destroy universe -- Not even RepG can do that!\r
* Pause/Resume with BYPASS: the print will pause but you can jog the motors, rehome, and such, then resume right where you left off.  Not even RepG will do this.\r
* Motor controls, move X,Y,Z,A,B -- even while a print is paused!!\r
\r
WIP WHY:\r
* MANY features still to add!\r
* Brand new, hardly tested!\r
* Firmware .hex file uploaded below is from my machine, with 2 toolheads.\r

I'm verbose by nature so I'm sure I'll have more to say, but I'm mostly busy coding on this right now, so I'll get back to you.\r

YOUTUBE VIDEOS:  \r
\r
Initial test: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0prldLWJgzk\r
Queuing up a (single) file to print: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbtRGPwFbU\r
Testing pause + motor override... FAIL!: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lebdaPDFlJk\r
 -- It /should/ stay paused on the motor menu and let me do what I want, but instead when I go to the motor menu it resumes printing.  FUnny enough, the command override does work, you'll see me raise Z a couple times and then it immediately goes back to where it was.  :)\r
\r
\r
UPDATE (v2):\r
Added queued print functionality, so you can pick a whole bunch of files off the SD card (or the same one a whole bunch of times) and the system will print them one after the other.  Does RepG still want you to do this manually by copypasting gcode?\r
\r
UPDATE (v3):\r
Added a bunch of features to the print queue, and a menu.  Added abort print, reset printer, and destroy universe commands.\r
\r
UPDATE (v4):\r
Added motor control menu... needs to be simplified a bit but it all works.  This release changes the semantics of the 'pause' control in RepG and elsewhere; now it pauses as soon as it finishes the current movement, instead of immediately.  Should be a minor difference, I hope.\r
\r
UPDATE -- noV:\r
I think I got myself up and running on github.  Let me know if I'm doin' it right.  Quite a bit different than my SVN!\r
