\r
WHAT IS IT?\r
A Chording Keyboard is a one-handed (usually) input device, where you type keystrokes by pressing combinations of buttons.  Kind of like playing Guitar Hero.  It's also called a Keyer.  All the commercially available designs are bulky, old, and stupid, but the basic idea of a chording keyboard is a great one for wearable computing.\r

I've always wanted to produce this design -- poor guy gave up before everyone on the planet had a 3D printer:  http://www.xaphoon.com/dataegg/\r
\r
MY DESIGN:\r
But my design is nothing of the sort.  I put this together a while back, before I had a 3D printer, myself.  If you want to go that route, you can... there's no reason to use my STLs, and they're not even complete.  So this is basically a very old project I am resurrecting now that I have more resources; but this version is basically the old resource-starved version.\r
\r
It's based around a Nintendo Wii remote.  These things are amazing devices for hardware hacking; the wiimote unit itself contains:\r
* Several accessable button/switches\r
* A speaker\r
* 3-Axis Accelerometer\r
* BLUETOOTH\r
* A point-tracking infrared CAMERA.  Seriously!\r
* Vibration buzzer\r
* Expansion port... with Arduino/ATmega library!!\r
\r
You can find Wiimotes on sale as low as $15; normally about $30.  There is no other way to get this kind of functionality attached to an ATMega/Arduino for twice the price.  Probably significantly more.\r
\r
WHAT YOU NEED:\r
This little project doesn't even use an ATMega or Arduino (yet) - all you need is a wiimote, some appropriate buttons, and a way to put/hold it all together.\r
\r
WHAT YOU GET:\r
The only software *I* am providing assumes you are running Linux, and will only work there.  But it would be trivial for anyone with knowledge of their operating system to modify for their purposes; the libraries it relies on are available on all platforms.  All you need to do is know how to hook into your OS's input queue so you can imitate a keyboard/mouse.\r
\r
WHAT IT CAN DO:\r
* Use the buttons to emulate a keyboard, obviously.\r
* Use the accelerometer to emulate a mouse.\r
* All this over BLUETOOTH!\r
\r
WIP WHY:  \r
* Just until I get some STLs that work for this design.  I have future designs already under way but they will be separate Thingiverse projects.\r
* I'm not uploading the .scad files until I'm done, since Thingiverse refuses to render STLs anymore in a Thing once I've uploaded something it can't render.\r
\r
ABOUT THE STL:\r
The STL published is a slightly fixed version of the one in the photos, which has too-thin walls and too little space between index finger and thumb buttons.\r
