Many thanks owed to DammitCoetzee, who thought up some even more clever directions to take this that I've not yet implemented.  And many many thanks to Worksofman for the awesome aluminum plate.\r

YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS VIDEO TO BELIEVE!\r

UPDATE! OMG! FORGET THAT VIDEO!  WATCH THIS VIDEO INSTEAD!  IT WILL EXPLODE YOUR HEAD!      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRt436ihaxw\r

How many times have you had to recalibrate your Z?  Not only do I never have to calibrate it again, I never have to go back and regenerate gcode if it changes.  My gcode automatically takes into account the current Zmin/max.  IS THIS AWESOME?\r

Here's a bonus, earlier video of me using the control pad to test it - trying to put it through the platform multiple times:\r

Some notes:\r
* Doesn't require any firmware mods or changes, unlike the ESTOP.\r
* If you are using the ABP belt, you can probably still use this outside its margins.\r
* I haven't printed on my fancy new alu plate, and I will cover it in kapton before I do.  Of course I will cut small holes to use for this leveling technique -- and I also intend to test whether the system will punch through the kapton and trigger the stop, or not.  -- UPDATE, it does not, unless the head is also moving in X+Y at the same time  So don't count on this to SAVE YOU but DO use it to calibrate in test points you have removed the kapton!  Video of punch fail here (not very interesting):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x6tTmTuSH0\r
* The SEXY and GORGEOUS alu plate was sent to me courtesy of Worksofman, whose website has some of the most fantastic metal sculpture I've ever seen:  http://www.worksofman.com/sculpture ... but you may have to find your own source for the plate; I think it was a one-time deal.  :)""" ;
