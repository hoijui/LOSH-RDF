function = "ScribbleJ is getting married!  \r\n\r\nAs I've never been one to wear jewelry, I have no idea what my ring size might be.  You can measure it with a string or something, but that's a horrible method since rings are far more rigid and regular...\r\n\r\nYou can go to a jeweler, but since I fully intend to buy the rings online from e.g. Amazon, bothering some salesperson for a sizing seems dishonest -- and of course dealing with salespeople is it's own special hell.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I'd whip up a quick OpenSCAD script to print simple rings in a few sizes, you can try them on and find out what fits right.\r\n\r\nNot a WIP - but I'll post photos after I've printed some."
