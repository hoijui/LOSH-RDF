function = "There's not a whole lot to say about this.  It's a biohazard symbol in OpenSCAD, to the exact government specifications.  I used this as a reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf\r\n\r\nIt's done in the 2d subsystem, so you can use it in 2d or apply a simple linear_extrude() to convert it to 3d.  \r\n\r\nThe example STL and DXF files are 51mm across, which is the diameter you get when you use A=1 according to the spec; the OpenSCAD file allows you to easily specify the diameter you desire, and can optionally join the 'inner circle' to make this a single object for printing instead of being 4 shapes as it actually is properly."
