function = "A simple parametric potentiometer dial in OpenSCAD.  There's really not a whole lot to say about this.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice in my photos I'm having some platform stick issues to work out right now, and therefore couldn't quite complete a print of the dials without the whole thing coming unstuck partway through -- but fortunately this happened late enough in the print that the dials are still perfectly usable."
