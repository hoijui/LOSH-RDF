function: "This is a basic design for a 3-channel PWM controller, like you might use to control a string of 12v RGB LEDs, like these, maybe: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.dealextreme.com/p/rgb-multicolored-1-meter-30-led-6w-light-strip-dc-12v-14965  (fun, because you can just cut it to the length you want, in minimum units of ~3 inches)\r\n\r\nI've got a few different things I want to do with this, but it was mainly a way for me to try designing and etching my first PCB.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n* Custom Arudino bootloader (kinda)\r\n* Three 200ma(ea) 12v PWM channels\r\n* Three analog input pins\r\n* Runs on 12v (good for use in a car!)\r\n* Minimal part count\r\n* Simple\r\n\r\n\r\nWIP WHY:\r\n* All the photos are of the first design, which as you can see, had a lot of mistakes requiring jumpering and trace-cutting.  I think they have all been solved in the uploaded schematic, but I haven't had an opportunity to print a new one to test.\r\n* The first design schematics are lost, sorry. :(\r\n* I'm using a custom arduino bootloader (will be provided below) and included an arduino pinout but I cannot get the arduino programmer to communicate with my Atmega8.  It does serial comms over those lines fine, otherwise.  Help appreciated.\r\n* I've /just/ used this in my first design (to be published shortly) so I'm still testing it.  Seems to work well these last few hours at least!\r\n* The transistor breakout board (the tc* files) I had to build on a protoboard as we've got a cold snap and I'm a wimp who will not go outside to etch if the weather is less than perfect.  As soon as it warms up a bit I'll be printing that and the new mainboard.  I might combine them."
