function: "I wanted to make something using my PWM RGB LED controller for my fiance, and this was the best I could come up with...\r\n\r\nHONEY, I LOVE YOU, AND IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS, RIGHT?\r\n\r\nThis youtube video doesn't do the colors justice; it scales smoothly though any color range you can imagine - the dials correspond to red, green, and blue intensities.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aEVVbl16cE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attached OpenSCAD files are roughly the worst code I've ever written in any language, anywhere.  Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI WOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH IF someone creative could design an ambiguous face that's easily interpreted as happy or sad or angry depending on the color for this ...  or something to that effect?  Ideas welcome."
