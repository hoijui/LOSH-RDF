function = "I was sitting around this morning and pondering the implications of modern computer logic, when it suddenly struck me that all modern logic systems are using 1s and 0s for signaling.  Sure, we all know this, but did you ever really think about what it MEANS?\r\n\r\nIt's a huge inefficiency!  So I pulled out a pair of tweezers, a very strong magnifying glass, and some leftover halfsies I had from going out to lunch with friends.\r\n\r\nBy using a steady hand, I was able to replace all the 1s in my Arduino with .5s, thus doubling it's speed and efficiency!  Now my printer thinks so fast it hardly has time to print anymore; I assume it's solving some deep mysteries and will eventually reveal the meaning of Life to me through interpretive printing."
