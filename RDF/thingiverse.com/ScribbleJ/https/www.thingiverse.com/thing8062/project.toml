function = "This is a WIP for sure; I'm just making it public because this project is intended to be a collaboration between myself and Bill Mania.    \r\n\r\nSadly, Thingiverse doesn't provide a true collaborative space, so any updates to the project Bill makes will need to be uploaded here by me.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, here's the initial files for Bill's review and editing pleasure -- and if anyone else has anything to add, I'm all for it.\r\n\r\nThe measurements in the STL and SCAD files are written to match a Nokia N900 but can easily be tweaked to fit any phone with similar design.\r\n\r\nIncludes a space for the camera so you can record your journey, as well as holes to access the USB and microphone/TV out/external antenna ports."
