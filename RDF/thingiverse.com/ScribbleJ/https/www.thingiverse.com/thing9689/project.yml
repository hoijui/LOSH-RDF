function: "This spool doesn't require you to have already printed anything - it just takes a little bit of physical labor.  $10 at the hardware store, a hacksaw or dremel, and 15 minutes and you have a TRULY USEFUL spool.  This is a perfect way to start your first print with a nice spooler.\r\n\r\nI've tried a few other simple spools and I've never managed to get anything to work well enough that I felt like I could walk away from my machine during a print.  THIS DOES."
