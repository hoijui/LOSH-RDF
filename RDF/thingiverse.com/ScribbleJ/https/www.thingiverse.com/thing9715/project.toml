function = "This is a co-invention, TheMegaCorp ( http://www.thingiverse.com/TheMegaCorp ) and I worked together to invent the ultimate simple build platforms for our Prusas.\r\n\r\nThese platforms are cut from 1/4\" MDF, with a top and bottom part that snap together tightly.  This allows you to have one heated platform with kapton for printing ABS and one with polycarbonate for PLA, or whatever combinations you need!\r\n\r\nTheMegaCorp added a hole in the bottom plate, so you can now access your belt clips and tighten your belt without removing anything!!!  GENIUS!\r\n\r\nYou can buy every part of this except the heated PCB in a single trip to Home Depot.\r\n\r\nIdeas for improvements:\r\n- add magnets to make a solid connection even after the boltholes eventually wear down.\r\n- get a better model than TMC... what's Vanna White doing now?"
