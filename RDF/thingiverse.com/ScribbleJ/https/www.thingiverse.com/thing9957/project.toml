function = "This is a simple way to cool your filament post-extrusion making tricky prints a little easier.\r\n\r\nYes, it's a bit ugly... I'd bet yours could be cleaner, I'm just always in a hurry.\r\n\r\nIt works - although I had a bit of a struggle to get great comparison photos, since things printed pretty well with it on and off.  Definitely better on, though!\r\n\r\nBE CAREFUL!  I haven't used this long-term and I don't know if the silicone tubing will stand up to heat over time.  I might put a layer of actual insulation between the tube and hot end (ZOLTEK! PYRON!)... \r\n\r\nI do know the tubing deformed on the first print, but it just made it fit the hot end better, it didn't melt or burn... so might be OK even without the insulation.\r\n\r\nBEFORE/AFTER PHOTO NOTES:\r\n\r\n* Printed on my Prusa, using a Makergear .35mm hot end.\r\n* Using 25-50mm/sec acceleration in Sprinter firmware."
