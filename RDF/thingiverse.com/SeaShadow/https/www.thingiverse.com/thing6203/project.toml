function = "I designed these mounts so that I could mount a pair of 120mm fans I had to my mendel.  You can use the mounts to fit most standard computer fans to M8 or 5/16\" threaded rod.\r\n\r\nI just use mine as a snap fit, but there are holes in the part that allow you to clamp them down on the rod using M4 nuts and bolts.\r\n\r\nFeel free to make requests for modifications"
