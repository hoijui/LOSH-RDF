function: "Build something your child will treasure for a lifetime, a treasure chest! Our son absolutely loves all things treasure, so I decided to create a small treasure chest for him. He absolutely loves the result, keeping his most valuable treasure safe inside. Then of course our other son wanted one desperately too, so I improved the cut and made another. And then the wife wanted one for her desk at work, and then one as a present for her sister\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xC2\xA6 So I thought I might share the design.\r\n\r\nFor 3mm MDF.\r\n\r\nFile optimised to share all cut lines and minimise material needed.\r\n\r\nGenuine curved wood slat lid.\r\n\r\nWorking lock.\r\n\r\n2 unique keys provided.\r\n\r\nGuaranteed to attract treasure of all kinds."
