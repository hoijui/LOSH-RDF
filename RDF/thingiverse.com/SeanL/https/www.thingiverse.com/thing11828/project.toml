function = "This Is a Man Running for no reason. It was designed in Autodesk Invetor Professional 2011 and 3D printed useing a MakerBot. It was inspired by the fact that i had to stay after school to design something to print. Because of this i was \"running late\" for cross country and subsequentally i designed a running man. It is basically a 2D doodle brought into the third demention using a 3D printer. It is a very simple design and fun to make."
