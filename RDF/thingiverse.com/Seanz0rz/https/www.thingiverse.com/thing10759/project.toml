function = "Here are some models of a knife, spoon, and fork. \r\n\r\nwith the exception of the knife, these will need support material. \r\n\r\nSolidworks files included so you can make changes. \r\n\r\ni believe these are the first of their kind at least on Thingiverse. hopefully these will inspire others to create different models as well!\r\n\r\nThey turn out to be fragile when printed. I will eventually update the stl's to create more robust utensils. the knife is almost at that point."
