function: "Designed for my HTC Inspire with a case. Fits phones between 3.5 and 5 inches tall and 2.8-3.2 inches wide, with a depth of approximately 0.5\"\r\n\r\nIt is designed to mount to a Go Pro mount, either suction cup or adhesive mount. \r\n\r\nThis is designed to hold my smartphone for GPS duty in my truck, so it is made a bit stout. \r\n\r\nI will eventually add some thumb nuts to allow tool-less operation,"
