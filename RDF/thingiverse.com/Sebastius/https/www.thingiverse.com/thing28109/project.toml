function = "To make calibration easy, use this large easy to print piece. 110mm for x and y, 4mm height. All squares are 10mm x 10mm.\r\n\r\nThe difference to smaller calibration pieces is that you can find really tiny errors with this. I found a 2% error in my print, 3 mm at this size. A standard 20mm calibration cube would have given you a .4mm difference. Still measurable but a lot more difficult."
