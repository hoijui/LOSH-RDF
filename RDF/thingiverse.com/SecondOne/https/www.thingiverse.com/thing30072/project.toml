function = "Cover for power supply.\r\nI made it for the MeanWell I bought but it should fit any psu with the mounting holes as they seem to be pretty standard probably.\r\n\r\nDerivative of the part ps-cover-1off.stl from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20968\r\n\r\nI took out the bit on the inside.\r\nMade the whole thing bigger.\r\nPut bigger sides on with holes lined up with the mounting holes on the PSU.\r\nNeeds to be a bit longer, I think, but it fits with mine. I did have to bend the pins on the power input though. \r\nFlipped the power input and output holes over to match with the terminal pins.\r\nMade with Google SketchUp and netfabb Studio\r\n\r\nI copied the same licence as the original."
