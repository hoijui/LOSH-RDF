I made it for the MeanWell I bought but it should fit any psu with the mounting holes as they seem to be pretty standard probably.\r
\r
Derivative of the part ps-cover-1off.stl from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20968\r
\r
I took out the bit on the inside.\r
Made the whole thing bigger.\r
Put bigger sides on with holes lined up with the mounting holes on the PSU.\r
Needs to be a bit longer, I think, but it fits with mine. I did have to bend the pins on the power input though. \r
Flipped the power input and output holes over to match with the terminal pins.\r
Made with Google SketchUp and netfabb Studio\r
\r
I copied the same licence as the original.""" ;
