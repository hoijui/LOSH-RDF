Our system may be a little bit complicated but we think it works propperly.\r\nAlso, it has took us a long time to print all the pieces and make the box, so we'll start correcting the mistakes by now.\r\nADVISEMENT: THE FILES HAVE SOME ERRORS, AND THERE ARE THINGS WHICH NEED TO BE FIXED, SO I RECOMMEND YOU NOT TO PRINT THIS YET."
