function = "This is a small about 4 inch model of the world famous Delicate Arch located in Arches National Park by Moab Utah. The arch was captured accurately in 3D using a FARO Focus 3D laser scanner as well as some areas captured using the free Autodesk 123D Catch which turns multiple photos from a digital camera to 3D models. \r\n\r\nI am posting the small reduced sized STL file so everyone can 3D print their own Delicate Arch. The lines produced from a MakerBot add even more realism to this sandstone arch and you can even wash it lightly with acetone  to smooth it up . The fine detailed arch is actually gigabytes in size.\r\n\r\nYou can see more on the creation of this model at \r\nhttp://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2012/02/delicate-arch-in-your-hand-as-a-3d-print.html"
