function: "Perhaps you\xE2\u20AC\u2122re a gardener and have seen these little butterflies (Cabbage Moth / Cabbage Butterfly Plutella xylostella, Pieris rapae) that lay eggs on cabbage, then the caterpillars devour your vegetables. It is referred to as both a moth and butterfly. It turns out these little delicate insects are highly territorial and wont go into a garden area where another is so we create a decoy."
