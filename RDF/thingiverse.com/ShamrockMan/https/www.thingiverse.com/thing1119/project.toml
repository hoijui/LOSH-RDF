function = "Bearing retainer plate for the other side of the bearing for the Z Axis. For the version to refit your Cupcake CNC without needing to remove the Z stage, use the U-Style version.\r\n\r\nFeatures integrated M3 nuts for ease of installation.\r\n\r\nNote: Do not print from SD card, as it will not stop on the operator stop for insertion of the M3 nuts.\r\n\r\n If you find that the upgrade version is not strong enough for you, use the thicker version which has a extra layer."
