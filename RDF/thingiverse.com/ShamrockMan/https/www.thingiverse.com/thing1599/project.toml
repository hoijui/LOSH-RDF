function = "Made obsolete by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2341\r\n\r\nUse for separating cap from beer bottle (non-twistoff).\r\n\r\nWorks on the same principle as banging the bottle against a counter. \r\n\r\nDoes not require the addition of any other parts (such as a penny as Zach originally suggested).\r\n\r\nNext version will have the handle slot deleted/fixed since it does not print correctly.\r\n\r\nCurrently is in beta state, has opened a bottle for me, but may not work for you. Please submit photos of the bottles it did not work on so I can improve the design.\r\n\r\nCurrent GCode file is for 4032D PLA, but may work for ABS. Its also raft-less since Ive found PLA prints better without one.\r\n\r\nNote: If you are making your own GCode for this, make sure you use at least 50% infill as anything less than that may make the part too weak to open the beer.\r\n\r\nSo far I have been able to open 3 bottles with one made out of PLA before failure. Let me know how different materials fair for you."
