    okh:function """Made obsolete by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2341\r
\r
Use for separating cap from beer bottle (non-twistoff).\r
\r
Works on the same principle as banging the bottle against a counter. \r
\r
Does not require the addition of any other parts (such as a penny as Zach originally suggested).\r
\r
Next version will have the handle slot deleted/fixed since it does not print correctly.\r
\r
Currently is in beta state, has opened a bottle for me, but may not work for you. Please submit photos of the bottles it did not work on so I can improve the design.\r
\r
Current GCode file is for 4032D PLA, but may work for ABS. Its also raft-less since Ive found PLA prints better without one.\r
\r
Note: If you are making your own GCode for this, make sure you use at least 50% infill as anything less than that may make the part too weak to open the beer.\r
\r
So far I have been able to open 3 bottles with one made out of PLA before failure. Let me know how different materials fair for you.""" ;
