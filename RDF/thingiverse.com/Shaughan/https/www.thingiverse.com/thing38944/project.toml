function = "I recently fitted a 3800mAh battery which included a new back cover to cope with the extra thickness of the battery. All up it added 5.4mm to the phone thickness, so it no longer fitted my first cradle design.\r\nI also had to dispose of my soft gell cover, and fitted a bumper cover instead through which the new back cover fits extremely well.\r\nThe new design retains the charging and antenna, but now allows both a standard nexus phone (with bumper or full gell cover) and an extended battery cover (with bumper) to slide down into it and be charged if you have a USB charge adaptor available.\r\nAdditionally, I removed the \"by Shaughan\" motive as I wondered if that put some people off from printing a cradle for themselves."
