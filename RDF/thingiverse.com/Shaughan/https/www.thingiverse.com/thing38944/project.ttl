    okh:function """I recently fitted a 3800mAh battery which included a new back cover to cope with the extra thickness of the battery. All up it added 5.4mm to the phone thickness, so it no longer fitted my first cradle design.\r
I also had to dispose of my soft gell cover, and fitted a bumper cover instead through which the new back cover fits extremely well.\r
The new design retains the charging and antenna, but now allows both a standard nexus phone (with bumper or full gell cover) and an extended battery cover (with bumper) to slide down into it and be charged if you have a USB charge adaptor available.\r
Additionally, I removed the "by Shaughan" motive as I wondered if that put some people off from printing a cradle for themselves.""" ;
