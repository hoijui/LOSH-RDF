function = "To fill a gearbox with grease can be messy scooping out of a container. I tried a grease cartridge but found it worse as I had to cut it open to get all the grease out.\r\n\r\nSo I designed a simple plunger that I could push down the open end and dispense the grease directly into the gearbox.\r\n\r\nAdded a 2\" version at the request of blu006."
