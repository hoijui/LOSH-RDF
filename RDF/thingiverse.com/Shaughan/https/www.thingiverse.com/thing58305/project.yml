function: "I am using my Nexus and Google Maps as my GPS when travelling. However, putting it somewhere is a problem, so I've adapted my holder for one of those suction cup windscreen holders.\r\nI've made the holder lighter.\r\nI've also removed the antenna cavity as well as the thumb cutout for removing the phone. (I found I never used it anyway). I left the recess for a power cable just in case, although for my own phone with the extended battery i don't need it.\r\nThis holder will well suit a permanent mount in your vehicle instead of my earlier models especially if you don't use the antenna.\r\n11/3/13: I've added small wraparounds to the top arms as the phone fell forward out of the cradle over excessive bumps."
