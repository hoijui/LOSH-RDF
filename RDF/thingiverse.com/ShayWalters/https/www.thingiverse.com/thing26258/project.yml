function: This is a caliper which is derived from several others here and elsewhere, but not enough from any single one that I felt like it qualified as a derivitive of any one in particular.  It is made on a laser cutter and gives readings accurate to 0.05 mm or 1/128 inch.  The actual accuracy will depend on the fit of the parts you make.
