function = "This is a gear I designed to make because I broke one of the wooden gears provided with the Techzone Laser-cut Wooden Mendel Kit.  I used this design to cut 1/16\" plastic (laser-engraving laminated material).  Photos include one showing a couple of wafers along with the damaged wooden gear, and another photo showing the assembled stack on the motor shaft."
