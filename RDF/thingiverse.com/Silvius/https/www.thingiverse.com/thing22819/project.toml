function = "Handle for the Ultimaker 3D printer (or other things). Idea by Martijn (http://www.thingiverse.com/Martijn).\r\n\r\nThe version I printed didnt have all the edges chamfered (ouch, sharp!) and didn't include the Ultimaker text, so that has not been tested yet.\r\n\r\nIt works like a charm, allowing you to carry your Ultimaker wherever. Of course I am not responsible for any damage (falling UM's) caused by using this!\r\n\r\nUse handle_straight if you want a straight bottom edge."
