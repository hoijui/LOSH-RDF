\r
\r
After poking around on here for a while, I decided it's time to contribute.\r
\r
So without further ado hereâ€™s my modified X Carriage based on Greg's X-Carriage.\r
\r
Basically after seeing many complex quick change systems to switch extruders, I wanted something simpler.\r
\r
Essentially this is a way of changing extruders by using the existing hardware and nothing more. We do this by taking a slot and hole idea seen on many household items to mount to walls ect. (i.e. on the back of power boards) with a screw in the wall and hanging it off the head.\r
\r
Current design is a little finicky on bolts being exactly right. Thinking of adding an indent where the bolts should end up and a spring washer to pull em in tight but allow room to get em back out by pushing on the end of the bolt while twisting (current design has no lock so it can vibrate loose if not tensioned correctly). Also rearranged the belt stuff in the center as I changed the corners of the big hole so there is more plastic where the bolt head goes through next iteration may use a spacer to help with holding the bolt in just the right spot (my groove mount plate has holes slightly wrong so holds the bolts in place but on a machine with correct spacing there could be a problem).  Also, everything is a little big atm slot and hole can be made a little narrower.\r
\r
\r
\r
A final note.\r
This has not had much testing yet, so only use it if you know what youâ€™re doing. It is also not fully parametric yet. Until it is more complete I won't be attaching the scad... soon (itâ€™s a bit of a mess atm)\r
\r
Also all credit where it's due to Greg and everyone else involved as this is essentially an addin file to replace the mounting holes.\r
\r
