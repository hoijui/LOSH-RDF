function: "UPDATE: No longer a work in progress, as it did work just not well enough. Version 2 now exists and is by far superior. If you want to print one of these I do recomend going for the Quick-Twist Release Greg's X Carriage instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter poking around on here for a while, I decided it's time to contribute.\r\n\r\nSo without further ado here\xE2\u20AC\u2122s my modified X Carriage based on Greg's X-Carriage.\r\n\r\nBasically after seeing many complex quick change systems to switch extruders, I wanted something simpler.\r\n\r\nEssentially this is a way of changing extruders by using the existing hardware and nothing more. We do this by taking a slot and hole idea seen on many household items to mount to walls ect. (i.e. on the back of power boards) with a screw in the wall and hanging it off the head.\r\n\r\nCurrent design is a little finicky on bolts being exactly right. Thinking of adding an indent where the bolts should end up and a spring washer to pull em in tight but allow room to get em back out by pushing on the end of the bolt while twisting (current design has no lock so it can vibrate loose if not tensioned correctly). Also rearranged the belt stuff in the center as I changed the corners of the big hole so there is more plastic where the bolt head goes through next iteration may use a spacer to help with holding the bolt in just the right spot (my groove mount plate has holes slightly wrong so holds the bolts in place but on a machine with correct spacing there could be a problem).  Also, everything is a little big atm slot and hole can be made a little narrower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA final note.\r\nThis has not had much testing yet, so only use it if you know what you\xE2\u20AC\u2122re doing. It is also not fully parametric yet. Until it is more complete I won't be attaching the scad... soon (it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s a bit of a mess atm)\r\n\r\nAlso all credit where it's due to Greg and everyone else involved as this is essentially an addin file to replace the mounting holes.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: SCADs up. go nuts"
