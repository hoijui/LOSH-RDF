function = "This is an attachement for a dremel to replace the holder provided with the little bolt hobbit.\r\n\r\nIts based on Router attachment for rotary tool by Lenbok (well the top part of it anyway).\r\n\r\nAlmost everything is panametric so the offset can be adjusted to get the hob in the perfect spot and to also get the perfect fit onto the dremel.\r\n\r\nLike the router attachemnt is uses sylwch's thread library thingiverse.com/thing:8793.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: corrected depth of nut catchment on the longer side, it was just a bit too far for a 15mm m3 to reach fully. Now no matter what offset is, using the same bolts should work"
