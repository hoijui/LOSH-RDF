function = "This is essentially a refinement of the code for the Ultimate Extruder Calibration Test.\r\n\r\nCleaned up alot of redundant code in the math and also fixed a few of the calculations so the variables would work correctly if changed from default settings.\r\n\r\nWhy you ask, well thats where the second part comes in.\r\nI've added a bit of code that lets you only print the bridges that fail after the first run making it quicker to calibrate settings, as ths object progressivly gets smaller, requiring less material and time to print."
