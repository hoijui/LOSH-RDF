function: "Version 1.3 of my tab slot generator\r\n\r\nA tab a slot generator. to add tabs to one object and a slot and groove to another object that the tabs will fit into and lock. \r\n\r\nNow made the change to allow  customizer generation\r\n\r\nalso added stop function to add a stop to the tab in circumstances where the material the slot is being made in is too think to have a groove and tabs will just run on other side of it. Stop will then not allow continuous rotation.\r\n\r\nTabs are to be used with a union (add material to an object)\r\nSlots are to be used as a Difference (take away material from an object)"
