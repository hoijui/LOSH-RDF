    okh:function """Well finally printed it and almost worked strait off the bat. The tabs are a little bit too long at the moment and have to shave about 0.5mm off of them, may be tollerance setting.  \r
\r
Basically bolt-on tabs on the bottom of the extruder and grooves in the x carriage that the tabs slide into and lock in place, takes about 3 second to take off an extruder, just twist and lift.  \r
\r
And no addition hardware  \r
\r
Print it just right and it will hold as good as a stock carriage.  \r
\r
Note: Pictured without nozzle in place to make it easier to photo.  \r
\r
UPTDATE:5 months later and I am yet to see the extruder wobble loose (at no point does the extruder move in such a way as to create a twisting motion) doubt the little locks I put in are even needed. 1 broke off and still works as intended without it.\r
\r
UPDATE 2: Almost 3 years on and finally a part failed. one of the tabs broke as I tried to force it in a bit too tight. I recommend adding a washer between bolt head and the plastic that is just big enough to go to the end but not extend over. This gives it some added strength and makes it quite rigid""" ;
