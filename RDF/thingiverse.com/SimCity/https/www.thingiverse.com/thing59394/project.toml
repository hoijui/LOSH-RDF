function = "UPDATE: There is something coming for this but I just got a new apartment so all spare time is going into moving.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I decided to put emmetts differential planetary gear on a nema17... I wonder what we could do with that now? (answer is coming)\r\n\r\nRipped the code from gregs x-ends, adjusted ratios and size to get a fairly decent gear that should be printable and fit between the mounting holes of a nema17 and mashed them together. This is the result. yet to print it but its all scad code so fairly simple to modify.\r\n\r\nToo hot to fire up printer atm, air con is struggling as it is. So yet to test this.\r\n\r\nNOTE: no linkages yet so still has the hex hole in the center so if you can find a hex nut with a work in the side that fits use that. otherwise wait or come up wiht your own."
