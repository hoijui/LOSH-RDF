function: "Hub for my fillament spool i use for loose fillament broke due to not feeding fillament through guide....\r\n\r\nTime to upgrade it. think i saw something simular for one of the other fillament spools but thought this one needed some love as well.\r\n\r\nstrpped out code for the center of hub, inserted emmetts bearing code in its pace and voila bearing hub\r\n\r\nUPDATE: so uploading stuff at 1am, not the smartest move. Forgot the bearing file, which is slightly modified from emmetts and forgot to flag as work in progress as i never had time to actually print it yet."
