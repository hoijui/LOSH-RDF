\r
Rather than adjusting the seat or moving the Cistern - which would be the 'proper' fix - you can spend twice as long making this 'engineered' solution and save an afternoon of unwelcome DIY.\r
\r
Just clip the holder on to the top lip of the cistern with the lid removed and position such that the seat is caught by one of the barbs.\r
\r
The tubular bit on the end is to make it more comfortable when it pokes you in the back (when you sit on the seat).\r
