function: "Many people have at least one toilet in their home where the seat REFUSES to stay in the upright position!\r\n\r\nRather than adjusting the seat or moving the Cistern - which would be the 'proper' fix - you can spend twice as long making this 'engineered' solution and save an afternoon of unwelcome DIY.\r\n\r\nJust clip the holder on to the top lip of the cistern with the lid removed and position such that the seat is caught by one of the barbs.\r\n\r\nThe tubular bit on the end is to make it more comfortable when it pokes you in the back (when you sit on the seat).\r\n\r\n;-)"
