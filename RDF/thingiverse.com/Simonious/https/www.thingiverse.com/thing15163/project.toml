function = "This is pretty close to the original y-axis makerslide mount.  It uses a little less material and moves the makerslide down about 20mm to recover a little wasted Z.\r\n\r\nAlso included are some very simple belt hold downs that fit the hole pattern of the original makerslide y-carriage, but aren't so tall that they'll cause problems - which will happen if you use this new y-mount and the old belt anchors.\r\n\r\nNote: My carriage is tall, if yours is not as tall as mine this may lower your makerslide so much that your bed won't clear the frame of your MM."
