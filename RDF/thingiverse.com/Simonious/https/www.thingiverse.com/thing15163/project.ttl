\r
Also included are some very simple belt hold downs that fit the hole pattern of the original makerslide y-carriage, but aren't so tall that they'll cause problems - which will happen if you use this new y-mount and the old belt anchors.\r
\r
Note: My carriage is tall, if yours is not as tall as mine this may lower your makerslide so much that your bed won't clear the frame of your MM.""" ;
