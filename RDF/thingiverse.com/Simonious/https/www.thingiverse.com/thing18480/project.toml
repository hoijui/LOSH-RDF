function = "A variation on the upper z motor mount for MendelMax.  This variation puts the motor a little lower than the stock version.\r\n\r\nThere is one sized for 10mm rods and one sized for 8mm rods.\r\n\r\nI've just uploaded a copy of each that should print flat, which should theoretically print faster than printing them from the end."
