function = "This is a new arduino mount for MendelMax that replaces one of the top vertexes.\r\n\r\nThis can be fliped over to work on either the right or the left of the bot.\r\n\r\nIt is also designed so you can attach it to the underside of the extrusion if you prefer, this will lower the RAMPs board about 20mm reducing the profile of your bot a bit."
