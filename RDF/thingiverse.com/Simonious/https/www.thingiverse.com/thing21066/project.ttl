\r
The second one *should* be a slightly better fit for the arduino - I moved the top hole that mounts to the MM frame up one MM, because I found it impacted with some arduinos.\r
I also moved the top left arduino mount hole down .5mm, because I found it was possible to use it, but that one hole seemed slightly out of place.""" ;
