\r
Most likely not the final version, I certainly welcome comments for improvements!\r
\r
Version 7!\r
\r
This version works pretty good.\r
\r
This version is a bit longer resulting in a more stable base for the spool.  There are holes for #5 screws, but you don't need to use them.  There are also holes to hold the bearings to the mount, but again you don't need to use them.\r
\r
Notes to me:\r
consider making inner bearing hole a touch smaller, so it grabs #5s without needing a nut.\r
\r
Consider making shoulder a touch taller, so bearing has no chance of rubbing on the body of the mount.\r
\r
This configuration is gripping the frame very well without a bolt and remains easy to reposition - probably final version, don't mess with it!  It works well.""" ;
