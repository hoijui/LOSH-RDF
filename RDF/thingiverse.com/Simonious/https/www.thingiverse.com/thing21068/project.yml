function: "Prototype spool mounts for MendelMax\r\n\r\nMost likely not the final version, I certainly welcome comments for improvements!\r\n\r\nVersion 7!\r\n\r\nThis version works pretty good.\r\n\r\nThis version is a bit longer resulting in a more stable base for the spool.  There are holes for #5 screws, but you don't need to use them.  There are also holes to hold the bearings to the mount, but again you don't need to use them.\r\n\r\nNotes to me:\r\nconsider making inner bearing hole a touch smaller, so it grabs #5s without needing a nut.\r\n\r\nConsider making shoulder a touch taller, so bearing has no chance of rubbing on the body of the mount.\r\n\r\nThis configuration is gripping the frame very well without a bolt and remains easy to reposition - probably final version, don't mess with it!  It works well."
