function = "This handle loosely fits an M8 threaded rod so it can rotate freely while the other side of the rod is in a drill chuck.  I use this when winding spools.\r\n\r\nby the way, the part that holds the bearing didn't get a chance to print on mine, it fell over - I probably should have made the base a little bigger on this one..  Still it works fine for my needs."
