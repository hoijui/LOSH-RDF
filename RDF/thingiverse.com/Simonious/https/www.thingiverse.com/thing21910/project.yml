function: "This is designed to hold an 8mm rod and mount to the top of a MendelMax.\r\n\r\nI designed this for a couple reasons.\r\n1: with the spool holders that ride on bearings on the edge of the spool itself I frequently get z repeating z-artifact.\r\n2: I can hold my printed spools or any other spools that don't have a way to roll."
