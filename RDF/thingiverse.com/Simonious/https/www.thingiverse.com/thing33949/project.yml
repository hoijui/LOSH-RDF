function: "These x-ends are compatible with the two slightly different leadscrew nuts Trinity has carried in the past.  This is accomplished simply by having 6 holes, 3 compatible with each nut type.\r\n\r\nThese x-ends use SA bushings (same OD for 8 or 10mm rods)\r\n\r\nThese x-ends don't hold x-rods, they hold a single 20x20 extrusion.\r\n\r\nBoth ends have an integrated bolt holder meant to interface with a z-endstop held in the lower part from thingiverse.com/thing:28425\r\n\r\nBy the way these are intended for 605zz idler bearings, you'll have to enlarge the hole either before or after printing if you intend to use 608zzs."
