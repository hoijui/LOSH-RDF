The holes in the end provide a place to store pencils, tweezers, odds and ends.\r\n\r\nIn the WireSpoolHolder version, if you set skeinforge to a dense fill, the bottom will be heavier than the top, providing extra stability.\r\nAlso, you can attach sticky sided velcro to the bottom for added holding down to a desktop."
