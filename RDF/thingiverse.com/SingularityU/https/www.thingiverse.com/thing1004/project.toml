function = "Our insulator retainer acrylic part broke when we hit a blob of plastic.  I was able to glue it back together but think it is a good idea to have an extra one around.\r\n\r\nOK, the acrylic part just shattered, so I installed the printed part and it is working great!\r\n\r\nI was concerned that the insulator may get too hot for an ABS part, but after several hours of operations at 220 degrees, it is working fine."
