function: "We are developing a 3d scanner based on parts printed from a makerbot.  These files show the printed parts, put together with a logitech camera, a laser, and a mirror mounted on a galvanometer.  The basic idea along with our first implementation is described here: http://abarry.org/stereo\r\n\r\nWe are developing the software using a microchip PIC to drive the mirror, along with software to obtain point clouds and meshlab to mesh the point cloud.  There is a long way to go with the software, but at least we have some nice printed hardware to get the data.  UPDATE: new scans -- we've added a screenshot of a scanned artichoke!"
