function = "I play a collectible card game (CCG) called \"Vampire: the Eternal Struggle\". The V:tES decks have more cards in them than the standard Magic decks. 102 cards in sleeves don't fit in most available deck boxes. So I learned Google Sketchup and made my own.\r\nIt's not fancy, but it's solid and fits really well.\r\n\r\nI also put the V:tES logo on the front of the box for added customization and opponent jealousy.\r\n\r\nHooray for my first uploaded design!"
