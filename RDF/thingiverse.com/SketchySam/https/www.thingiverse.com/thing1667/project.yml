function: This is a handhold to be bolted onto an indoor rock climbing wall. I printed it out with ABS and experienced some warping issues because it is such a large part. Widget tells me that printing with PLA may solve the warping issues so I'll try that next. I haven't actually tried this on the wall yet. I'll let you know how it goes...
