function: "To replace my broken tripod mounting, which I've repaired several time by other means but I've simply given up on now that it's in shattered ruins once and for all.\r\n\r\nFully assembled it provides for three degrees of rotation so you can set the camera at the desired angle. Design is fully printable with no glue or fasteners required (though a dab of glue in one spot might be a good idea, see instructions) EXCEPT a metal nut to hold it onto the tripod legs and a metal bolt (cut to length) to screw into the camera."
