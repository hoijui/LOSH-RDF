function: "This is a Gingerbread person cookie cutter. I was planning for a party, needed some interesting cookie cutters. I found lots here, but not many that were simply traditional gingerbread men.\r\n\r\nDesigned quickly in SolidWorks and exported to STL. Should be approximately 6\" in height. My print was scaled to 85%."
