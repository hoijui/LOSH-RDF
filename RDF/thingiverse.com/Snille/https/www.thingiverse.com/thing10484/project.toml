function = "Ever been irritated of the plastic foil roll popping out of the box when trying to tear it of? Then this is for you! Print two sets of these and mount them. One part in the roll and the other part through the paper box to snap together with the inner part. The only drawback is the you will need to crack the paper roll when you want to remove the holders. :)\r\n\r\nUpdate: Updated the files to correct the size a bit (the parts where too big).\r\n\r\nUpdate: Changed some sizes to make a better fit."
