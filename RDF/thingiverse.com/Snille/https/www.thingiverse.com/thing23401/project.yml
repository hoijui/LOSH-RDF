function: "This is for an old household assistant (in Swedish it's called \"Hush\xC3\xA5llsassistent\"). It is used for kneading the dough when you bake.\r\n\r\nI made this to my Mother. She was about to buy two new nobs for her old Electrolux machine. The price for each nob was over \xE2\u201A\xAC20!\r\n\r\nSo, I printed two instead... :)"
