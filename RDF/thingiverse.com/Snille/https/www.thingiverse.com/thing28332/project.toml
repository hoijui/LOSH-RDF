function = "I have made some changes to the LCD-case to not have the LCD protrude out of the case and some other smaller details inside. Made the \"gaps\" for both the SD-card and ribbon-cable smaller. I ordered this kit from the eMaker shop ( http://www.emakershop.com/browse/listing?l=301 ). But I already ran Marlin on a 1284. In the kit I got a ribbon-cable with 24 leads. I use the extra pair for the \"PWR\" led. :) The stands where originally form this panel: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21677 However I modified them a bit. There is still a slight overweight towards the front so the panel will fall forward if the stands are not fasten in to something."
