function: I was looking for models of servos online, then realized (after not finding many...) that I think we already had one. Yup - the SO5/STD by Grand-Wing Servo is a Futaba-spline cloned servo. The GM4 has no servo brains - just a pair of wires connected to the motors, and a continuous-rotation output gear.
