\r
The original files are in EPS/DXF format, so I tweaked them up and laid them out in a CorelDraw X4 file for our 24x18" bed 60W Helix laser.\r
\r
During assembly, we found out the fingers are 2mm, not 4mm like the rest of the material, so the bottom disk slots have been suitably widened.\r
\r
UPDATE: The fingers suck even with 2mm. I snagged quite a few times, so we ended up redoing them first on 1/16" plywood, then our latest version uses loops of 3mm filament. Update coming.\r
\r
UPDATE - Feb 2011: The fingers still snapped. Redesigned to use "U" loops of filament instead. Also the T-slots are mostly still too small for 4-40 nuts (identified). Added assembly notes.""" ;
