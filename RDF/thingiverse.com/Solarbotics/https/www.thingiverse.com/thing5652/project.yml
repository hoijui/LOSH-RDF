function: "NOTE: This isn't Thing-O-Matic compatible (which I found out). Had to build lip-edge holders as the ToM sits on the edges of the box rather than _inside_ the box. Whole box needs to grow ~6mm in X & Y direction to properly fix ToM. Justsoyaknow...\r\n\r\nThe original files are in EPS/DXF format, so I tweaked them up and laid them out in a CorelDraw X4 file for our 24x18\" bed 60W Helix laser.\r\n\r\nDuring assembly, we found out the fingers are 2mm, not 4mm like the rest of the material, so the bottom disk slots have been suitably widened.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The fingers suck even with 2mm. I snagged quite a few times, so we ended up redoing them first on 1/16\" plywood, then our latest version uses loops of 3mm filament. Update coming.\r\n\r\nUPDATE - Feb 2011: The fingers still snapped. Redesigned to use \"U\" loops of filament instead. Also the T-slots are mostly still too small for 4-40 nuts (identified). Added assembly notes."
