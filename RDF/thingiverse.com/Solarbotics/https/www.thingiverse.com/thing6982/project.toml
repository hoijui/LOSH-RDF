function = "We build things with Arduino / Freeduino, but the wires to get messy. Aha! I see a laser cutter in the corner - what can we do with that?...\r\n\r\nThis is designed to fit an Arduino Uno form-factor microcontroller board, and has knockouts designed to fit the Freeduino mini-USB jack too. Corner chase-ways allow for wiring to be fed external to the enclosure, and mounting holes are located for mounting a 5-cell AA battery pack underneath.\r\n\r\nWe've got faceplates arranged for the Netduino standard and Plus, and a tall version with legs to suspend even a battery-pack laden enclosure off the ground.\r\n\r\nIf you just want one, check them out at http://www.solarbotics.com/products/60100"
