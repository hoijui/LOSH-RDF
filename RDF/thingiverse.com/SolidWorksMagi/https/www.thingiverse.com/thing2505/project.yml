function: "This is a wheel kit to allow the CupCake MakerBot to build a wheel larger than the standard 100mm x 100mm MakerBot platform allows.  \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the more assembled image that it is easy to make paper/card wheel hubs with different \"faces\" on them to alter the look of the wheels ... Christmas, Halloween etc... but the faces can also be cut into thirds/fourths to MakerBot them as part of the wheel building too.\r\n\r\nThis is another of many entries to the makezine.com/go/makerbot  contest ...\r\n\r\nblog.makezine.com/archive/2010/04/makerbot_giveaway.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI really need a job ... but I can design a custom part if you like on contract."
