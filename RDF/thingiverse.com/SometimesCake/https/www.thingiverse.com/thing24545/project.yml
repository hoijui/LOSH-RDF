function: "After doing a lot of reading and a bit of testing this fan mount was the best solution I have yet found for the Printrbot LC.  \r\n\r\nI tried the http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21462 fan mount, but it acted as a shim to raise the extruder.  I had to compensate my lowering the z axis so low that it hit the hold downs for the glass.  I ended up losing almost 3 inches on the Y axis.  No good.  I tested the part to see how it did at cooling.  It cooled really well, but noted that I lost almost 15 deg C on the heated platform. :-/  Not wanting to find another solution for my heated platform I kept looking.\r\n\r\nThen I found http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15899.  So I tested placing the fan on the side where it would still move up and down with the extruder.  The headed platform only lost 3deg C and the parts printed really well.  \r\n\r\nThis part completely replaces the wood one the Printrbot came with.  I did this so I could use the same screws.  The hardware store near my house doesn't carry 6-32x1 3/4 screws.  2 inch would hit the drive belt.\r\n\r\nI've attached an image of two gears I printed.  Both at .2mm layer height.  The gear on the left is with the fan on and the gear on the right is with the fan off."
