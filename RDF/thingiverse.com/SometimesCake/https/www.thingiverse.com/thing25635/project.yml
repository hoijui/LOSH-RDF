function: "I wanted a ruler that was the right size to use in sketching my ideas on a clip board.  I found http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1888\r\n\r\nIt was close to the right size but it had protruding surfaces that were awkward if the ruler was flipped over when sketching.  The length was a bit too long to fit on my print bed too.\r\n\r\nThis ruler is 132mm long and has cm tick marks on the top and bottom of the ruler.  It also has a 45 deg angle on one end and a 60 deg angle on the other.  \r\n\r\nThis is my ideal sketching tool.  My neighbor saw it and asked that I would print some off for his kids.\r\n\r\n(UPDATE) I decided that I like the ruler better without the notches on the back side.  I didn't use them and they tended to get in the way when tracing a straight line.  Check out version two.  :)"
