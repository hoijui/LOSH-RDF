function = "I noticed that my wooden desk was acting like a sound board for my Printrbot.  So I went to my local home center and bought some \"softtouch 1/2 bumpers\".  They didn't look like they would stick too well to the rounded wooden surface.  I found this part http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24183 and decided the PrintrBot needed its own version.  \r\n\r\nI have redesigned this part.  If you are considering this part check out the new one. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39300  I find it works much better in the long term."
