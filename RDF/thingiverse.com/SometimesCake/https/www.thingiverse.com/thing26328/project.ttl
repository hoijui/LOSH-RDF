\r
I was enjoying a good game of Seej and I thought to my self, wouldn't it be nice if the pennies would collect them selves?  Then I thought of the basketball goals over paper trash bins.  Desktop basketball was born!\r
\r
This is a challenging game with the included flipper.  \r
\r
I could use some help with a good design for a highly accurate, less powerful catapult for this game.  :)\r
\r
Enjoy!""" ;
