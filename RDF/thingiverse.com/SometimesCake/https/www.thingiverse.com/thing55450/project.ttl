    okh:function "I really liked the pencil holder from MyDogJustice, however I was disspaointed in how smooth the sides were of the STL.  I also found it annoying the the pencils would slide right through because there was no bottom.  I rebuilt the model in Open SCAD.  It was an experiance.  I also built it so the extractor could actually work." ;
