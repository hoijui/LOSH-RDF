function = "Bendy envelope is an adjustable and printable envelope that you can change to fit the content of your envelope. You are able to change the height and width of the file as well as the depth. You can change the material you want the envelope to be made of. The best thing about this design is that you can print on sturdy materials such as mount board, and the envelope is still able to bend. Enjoy!"
