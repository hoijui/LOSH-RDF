This is my very first creation.\r
\r
The one on the right is the final ring, printed with a layer thickness of 0.1 mm. It needed a raft to stick to the blue painters tape (?) that came with my Replicator 2. The raft made the edges a bit rough, so I dipped in in nail varnish remover (acetone) for 5-10 seconds and rinsed it in water.\r
\r

EDIT: I improved the .scad file quite a bit, it and its .stl is uplaoded as moebius ring_4""" ;
