function: "My wife wanted a M\xC3\xB6bius band shaped ring.\r\nThis is my very first creation.\r\n\r\nThe one on the right is the final ring, printed with a layer thickness of 0.1 mm. It needed a raft to stick to the blue painters tape (?) that came with my Replicator 2. The raft made the edges a bit rough, so I dipped in in nail varnish remover (acetone) for 5-10 seconds and rinsed it in water.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the process and pictures of all prototypes, visit http://furboskov3dprinting.blogspot.dk/2013/01/mobius-ring.html\r\n\r\nEDIT: I improved the .scad file quite a bit, it and its .stl is uplaoded as moebius ring_4"
