function: "Holds two pieces of cardboard together.\r\n\r\nWe have two boxes that, when put on top of each other, is a great hiding place for the cats. However, they keep knocking the top one down. I made this piece to hold them together. The bottom box edge is thicker, as it is made of several pieces of cardboard.\r\n\r\nFor the perpindicular, the two edges have the same thickness."
