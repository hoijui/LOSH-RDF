function = "A perl script to create a .scad file for a support tree.  \n\nYou need to input the spread for X and Y, and a formula for the height at each point.  \n\nThe tree build is not optimal in either material or vertical space.  \n\nKnown bugs: For large trees, especially if the height of the support points are not the same, it builds several sub trees. I do not have the time to find and correct this bug at the time being, so use with care, and manually add the branches needed."
