    okh:function "I recently spilled a whole can of beer on to my brand new Das Keyboard. I was able to get the switches clean again with contact cleaner but I had to remove the keycaps to get to the switches. So I neatly packed the removed keycaps away, only to find two of them missing upon reassembly. So I decided to try to print a replacement. I took measurments off of one of the caps and tried my best to recreate it in FreeCAD. I never used a CAD program before and I have not yet printed this thing, but I thought hey, this might be useful for others, why not put it on thingiverse?" ;
