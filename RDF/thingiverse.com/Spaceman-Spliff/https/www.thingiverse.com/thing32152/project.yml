function: After designing my replacement keycap http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31995 I thought I could of course remove all the other keys and replace them with old typewriter keys - so I quickly sketched up a typewriter-like keycap that should fit on the Das Keyboard switches. I don't know if I will ever need it, but after the problems I had with the "original" key design it was really easy to put this together, so, yeah...
