function = "If you ever played the tabletop game Smallworld (as shown by Wil Wheaton on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QtdiRJYro) you'll know that fiddling out those race chips at the very bottom of the stack can be a pain. So ever since I started playing, I was thinking about building a pez-style dispenser for the Race and Money Chips. \r\nBut I never could decide what kind of ejection mechanism I should use, so instead I designed this simple holder that's supposed to work a bit like a dealing shoe. Just drop your chips into the top and gravity feeds them to the bottom, where a wedge pushes the bottommost chip out a bit and a cutout allows you to access it... Take as many as you need. The height of the container is enough to hold all the skeleton chips in the game - so it should be more than enough space for all the other races."
