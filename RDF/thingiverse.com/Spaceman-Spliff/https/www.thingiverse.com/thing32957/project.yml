function: "This is part of an ongoing project which aims to refit an old Agfa \"Brownie Box\" camera to accept standard 35mm Film. I have been tinkering around with this Idea for years now, but was stymied by the problem of loading and unloading the undeveloped film without using a dark room...\r\nSince I should have access to a 3D printer, soon, I figured it would be time to revisit this project once more in the hope of finding a solution that I could not envision using other production methods.\r\nThe idea behind this design is to unspool the film from the canister it was delivered in directly into the (hopefully light-tight) 3D printed container before loading it into the brownie box. Thus, when the 35mm film is removed from the container to load into the camera, only one or two frames of film will be exposed, much like with other analog loading mechanisms...\r\nThis will have the added advantage that any pictures taken will be spooled up into the 35mm canister after exposure.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress as I have not yet had the opportunity to print the design. Also I'm still thinking about a simple method of unspooling the film from the 35mm canister into the container..."
