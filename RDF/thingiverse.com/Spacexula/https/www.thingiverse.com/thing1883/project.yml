function: "I have now printed 2 complete sets of Mendel.  I switched to these files after the 1st print.  This breaks a Mendel down into 24 prints, averaging 2-3 hours a print.  It also uses the smaller RP parts to hold down the raft for the larger prints.  It works pretty good (but not as good as a heated plate).  The good thing is that this design works just as good with no raft on a hot plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use just export each \"plate\" as a separate stl, skeinforge and print.  I have them separated on my computer but that's a lot of files to upload.\r\n\r\nAlso I included the non joined plates, so if you can find a way to turn it into a 23 or 22 plate print please improve on my work.\r\n\r\nThis is the easiest way to print Mendel I have found, and the beautiful part is if you are using something with a larger build plate than a Makerbot, just join four of these and you can print Mendel in 6 prints!\r\n\r\nMuch Props to Ryan P, and Cyrozap for fixing my broken files.  I don't know how those got messed up, but they fixed it, and dealt with my VERY slow responce.\r\n\r\nHonestly I was print 1 of these and not noticing it was build in the air, the other I fixed in my person sel, and never uploaded the fix.  Their fixes where better than mine.\r\n\r\nSo now ALL these should work 100%.  If they don't email me the fix and flame me in the comments!\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
