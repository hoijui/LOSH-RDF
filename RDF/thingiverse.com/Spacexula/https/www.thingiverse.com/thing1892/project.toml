function = "All the RP parts for Mini Mendel in 1 sheet, with a 80x80x.005mm sheet for comparison (dang that's not much stuff to print).\r\n\r\nRhys Jones was nice enough to clear up some of my issues with the parts list.  These parts are for the FULL Micro Mendel, with the filament & electronics underneath.\r\n\r\nNot supported, not recommended, but now available in an easily printed form."
