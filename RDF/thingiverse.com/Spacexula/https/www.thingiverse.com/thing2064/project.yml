function: "This is the calibration prints that I always use when I deicde to try out the new version of skeinforge.  I can't find how to make a derivative, so these will be derivative as soon as someone shows me the obvious bright red button I missed.\r\n\r\nThe thin walled box is Dmatsumoto's http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1637. it is unaltered, because it's just perfect.\r\n\r\nThe two other blocks are alterations of Bre Pettis's 40mm cube http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:477.\r\n\r\nI learned this technique from several places, but I didn't understand it till I read Makerblock's wonderful blog post at http://makerblock.com/2010/02/makerbot-skeinforge-tuning-and-calibration/, check it out, he makes since (unlike me).\r\n\r\nI can usually dial my skeinforge in almost perfectly just using these 3 items."
