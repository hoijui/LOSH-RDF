function: This is the compression section of pinch wheel extruder strongly based off Wade's http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1794 worked up in HeeksCAD.  This is not intended to be printed, but to make it easy for you to create your own version of an extruder.  It took me hours to get everything lined up, hoping to save you the trouble.
