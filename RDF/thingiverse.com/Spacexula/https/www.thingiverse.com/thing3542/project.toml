function = "This is a directive of Makerbot's Horizontal Filement Spool.  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3116.  It takes about 3 hours to print, and the size can be adjusted to any footprint depending on how long you make the rod.  It is designed to 8mm Metric, but my build is using 5/16, which works perfectly well, so no need to have two versions.\r\n\r\nYou can see what it looks like in this video:\r\nhttp://il.youtube.com/watch?v=N4j2pJzM13Q\r\n\r\nThe HeeksCAD file is the raw solids before I chaffered (Some of the blocks might be a little off, it's before I finished it up for upload), so all can be modified completely.  There is no Tube feeder included in that file because it's so easy to throw together (2 8mm cylinders, 1 12x12x22 block, and a 2 booleans, 2 minutes work in Heekscad)"
