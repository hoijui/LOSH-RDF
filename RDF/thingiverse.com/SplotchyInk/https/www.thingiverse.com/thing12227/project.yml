function: "This is a basic model of a character I created for a video game concept.  A simple character, a basic over weight brat of a dragon child that kind of plays as one of the comedic foils in the storyline of the game itself.  More likely than not this is not going to be the final design of the character so I feel confadent sharing him with everyone.  Also makes me feel accomplished by turning some silly concept in my mind and making it real.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is the first thing that I've designed that I printed on my 3D printer, so I decided to share the chubby brat with everyone else.\r\n\r\nNot to mention those tiny wings might also serve as a test of your printer's accuracy and support structure building."
