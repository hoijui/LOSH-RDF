\r
This was kind of an experiment. I've never held or seen Wade's original extruder in my hand, so hopefully this is an improvement. Give it a try, but be warned that my STL exporting plugin doesn't play nicely with scale. If it's coming out the wrong size for you, look here for reference: (the original!)\r
