function = "The Hobbyzone SuperCub LP has a factory option mount on the bottom of the plane, on the battery door to be specific, that is meant for a couple optional items like a parachute guy and a balloon dropper.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to use this as a platform to mount cameras and other things so I designed this basic horizontal mount.  It is simple but it snaps perfectly onto the option mount.\r\n\r\nI'm including the Google Sketchup file so you can modify the mount point to suit your needs."
