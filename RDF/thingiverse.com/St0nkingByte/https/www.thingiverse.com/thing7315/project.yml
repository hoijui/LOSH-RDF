function: At work we recently moved into a new building with modular/movable cube and office walls.  Unfortunately they didn't buy enough of the fancy (possibly expensive?) metal coat hooks that hang the tracks on the walls so I made my own.  Simply snaps into the ~8mm track in the wall.  I've printed a dozen or so copies with PLA and they can hold very heavy jackets.
