function: "While doing research as an undergraduate, several of my labmates had to constantly clean 22 x 22 mm glass cover slips in a special solution for microscopy experiments.  They could only wash these cover slips ~5 at a time with some repurposed equipment.  Realizing how frustrating this must be, I designed a modular cover slip holder that can be used to hold 20 cover slips at once, or many more when stacked in a beaker.\r\n\r\nDimensions are 55 mm in diameter, 30.7 mm tall."
