Using OpenSCAD, the user can define their build volume, import multiple STLs, and position them around in 3D space without having to write the code by hand.\r\n\r\nEditable Parameters:\r\nPosition from center(mm): x,y,z\r\nRotation about axis(degrees): x,y,z\r\nMirror about plane: x,y,z\r\n\r\nFor strategies on creating printing plates efficiently, there is a good writeup on the MakerBot blog: http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2011/09/19/how-to-make-a-printing-plate/"
