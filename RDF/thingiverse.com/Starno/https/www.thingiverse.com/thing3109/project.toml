function = "My Makerbot was having a hard time printing out thin walls with water-tight settings, so I made this simple hollow cube to calibrate again from scratch.  The walls of the cube are 1.5mm because that is the minimum thickness I would ever use.  (See the OpenSCAD files if you\\'d like to change dimensions)\r\n\r\nWhile going through the calibration process, I strategically changed one Skeinforge parameter at a time no matter how mundane or obvious the change seemed to be.  The process is documented with expected vs. actual results, notes, build times, high res pictures, and download-able gcode files for those interested in SkeinView-ing.\r\n\r\nYou can find it on the Wiki: http://wiki.makerbot.com/skeinforge-calibration-logs  \r\n\r\n\r\n2 Hollow Cubes.stl is for optimizing oozebane or extruder controlling for multi-part prints.  (I haven\\'t gotten that far, yet.)"
