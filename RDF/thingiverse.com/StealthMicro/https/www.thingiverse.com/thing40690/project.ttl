    okh:function "Credit has to go to Plasma2002 for this one.  I simply took his idea and modified it to fit more common razor blades.  I also am including the AutoCad dwg file.  I made mine out of 1/4 inch acrylic and I love these things.  Gone is my honeycomb table.  No more is the occasional discoloration you get when the laser gets to the edge of the honeycomb table and is just a little too hot and melts the material you are working with.  Plus you can see so much better what you are working on.  I usually have around 6 of these little guys floating around on the bed at any given time or less if the material is smaller and I need to see around." ;
