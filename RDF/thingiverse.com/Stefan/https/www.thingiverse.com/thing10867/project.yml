function: This is a maple seed concept I worked on last fall.  I couldn't quite get my machine to print one perfectly.  The super thin blade was problematic for my cupcake and settings.  The hook is for a rubber band launch.  I was hoping for a slingshot style launch into the blue with a slow flutter back to earth.  It launches nicely, but only spins and falls slowly about half the time.  It needs to be optimized for transition to spinning descent.
