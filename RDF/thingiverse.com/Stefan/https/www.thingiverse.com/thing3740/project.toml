function = "This is a car Dock for my Motorola Droid.  I couldn't find the right one in a store or online, so I designed my own and printed it.  If you have a 2003 Mazda Tribute, then you are in luck.  Otherwise you will need to adapt it to fit your car.  My car has a little pocket that the dock wedges into nicely.  The clamp ring helped to take the complexity out of the biggest part to ensure a smooth print.  The little 1/8\" dia x 1/4\" long magnet tells the Droid to automatically go to Car mode.  If you reverser the magnet, then it will go to the other dock mode which is more of an alarm clock look."
