function: "Printable Ball-and-Socket parts suitable for all kinds of applications. Hello helping hands, gorilla pods, coolant hoses. There is a hole in the middle to accomodate cables. Mine will become a small worklight to be screwed inside my printer. \r\nI think i will add some parts over time, like a housing for some leds. \r\nThere is also a flange that i didn't print yet. Who is first on this?"
