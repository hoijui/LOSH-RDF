function = "This is a redesigned prusa SAE x carriage, for the motor side. It was done in solidworks 2010, and is designed with printability as it's main goal. I had problems with overhangs, and thin parts breaking off, and this should solve those issues. Also, I hate gluing parts so I just added holes for bronze bushings in the support column. I'm getting ready to print this now, I'll try and post pictures when I'm done. Looking forward to comments!"
