function = "This is yet another filament management system, but this one works with spools, and most coils. I've tested this with spools from makerbot, 3dprinterstuff, and ultimachine, all without problem, and then coils from ultimachine and makerbot. I've got about 100 hours on this thing without a tangle. So it's pretty wonderful! If there's interest, let me know, and I'll put some kits together on Indiegogo."
