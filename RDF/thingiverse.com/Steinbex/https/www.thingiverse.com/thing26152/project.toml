function = "This is a drop in replacement for the stock frame of a Gaui 330xs. The original frame was cheap and flimsy, and this has proven to be rock solid, better in a crash, and has better wire management. \r\n\r\nI've finished design on a few upgrades that make the frame much much tougher. A prop snapped today, and it fell a good ten feet and no breakage on the frame. This is a seriously high performance machine. \r\n\r\nRecent test went like this, take it up to ~30' turn on throttle hold, it hit the grass arm first with no damage!\r\n\r\nAlso, 3 kit versions are coming, along with some minor upgrades."
