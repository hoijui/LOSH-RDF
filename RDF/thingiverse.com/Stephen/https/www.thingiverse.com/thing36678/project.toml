function = "A handy case with a detachable probe to house your Geiger Counter kits.  I designed it to fit the DIYGeigerCounter v.4.1 board (https://sites.google.com/site/diygeigercounter/).  I've included a version without standoffs for those of you who wish to fit a different kit.\r\n\r\n[Revision] The Handle grooves have been removed.  Otherwise, it would of been impossible to print.\r\n\r\n[Revision] Probe holder design changed.  The probe now slides into the holder vertically.  This change minimizes the effects on the holder from warping."
