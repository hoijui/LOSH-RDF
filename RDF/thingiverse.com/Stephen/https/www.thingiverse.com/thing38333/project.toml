function = "Concept design attempt at removing all those nasty smells from my Prusa-Mendal without having to box the entire thing.  Uses a blower fan to suck fumes directly from the extruder nozzle and then exhausts out the nearest window.  \r\n\r\nCurrently I'm having trouble finding thin walled flexible tubing to connect the nozzle to the fan.  The clear vinyl tube that i'm using right now adds a lot of unwanted force onto the x-carriage."
