function = "This fan is just an experiment and is not intended for long term operations.  It moves a decent amount of air but slightly vibrates due to improper alignment and a lack of bearings. I'd like to find a way to alleviate these problems without resorting to any vitamins.   \r\n\r\nThe dimensions are in no way optimized for maximum airflow.  All fan characteristics were implemented based on countless model simulations done in my head using highly advanced guesstimate techniques.  I may of also been distracted by the latest episode of The Walking Dead  while performing these specialized simulations.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in actual Centrifugal Fan design, check out these PDF's:\r\nhttp://www.wesellfans.com/pdf/underStanding-Centrifugal-Fans.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ijaet.org/media/0001/5PARAMETRIC-STUDY-OF-CENTRIFUGAL-FAN-PERFORMANCE-EXPERIMENTS-AND-NUMERICAL-SIMULATION-Copyright-IJAET.pdf"
