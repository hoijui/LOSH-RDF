function = "A handy storage device for all of you who received a Keurig for Christmas.  It will hold one package of K-Cups (12).  Each cup is stored horizontally until the lid is drawn out of the case.  The cups will then drop 45 degree's for easy access.  Its not the most practical means of storage but, it was fun to design.\r\n\r\nCurrently my mother is visiting and is very sensitive to fumes, so I will not be able to do a test print until Monday.  I don't recommend printing this until I've ensured that the dimensions work."
