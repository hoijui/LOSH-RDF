function = "This is a very rugged C cell battery holder that can stack modularly. The C cells snap in (push real hard). The battery holders can be stacked together and even glued to make 3v, 6v, 9v, 12v, 18v, etc.  C cells provide enough power for almost any job.  There is a grove and two holes on the side for a twist wire for further securing either the batteries or the holder.  To remove the C cells there is a hole in the bottom where they can be pushed out.  Have fun."
