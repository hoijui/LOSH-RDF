function = "This thing keeps fingers, wire nips, pliers, and other assorted appendages out of the extruder fan; items which may be bad for fan blade health. I designed it after destroying my original Ultimaker fan with a pair of snips.\r\n\r\nThis one sports the Georgia Tech Interlocking GT for Yellow Jacket school spirit.  I designed it for the GT Invention Studio Ultimaker."
