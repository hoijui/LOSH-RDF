function: "It can often be hard to remove a print from the bed. This holder grips a flexible razor blade that's then supple enough and thin enough to slide between the thing and the bed, so enabling it to be lifted off easily.\r\n\r\nThe surprising thing about this object is that 3D printers are able to cope with a horizontal slot of just 0.4mm high into which to slide the blade. \r\n\r\nThe scraper was created with the free app 123D Design, and you can read about how it was made on http://3dgeni.us"
