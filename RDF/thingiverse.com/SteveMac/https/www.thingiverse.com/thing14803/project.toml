function = "I have a couple of single LED lamps mounted on the front arms of my Mendel, but i wanted more light, and an adjustable source.\r\n\r\nI designed this thing.  It bolts onto 8mm bar, and has adjustable elbows, and holds an LED module with 3 LEDs.\r\n\r\nI found this LED module at Jaycar.\r\nJaycar Part Number ZD0473.  $3.00 each.\r\nIt has 3 LEDs and a resistor on a flexible strip, with adhesive on the back.\r\n\r\nIt consists of 3 parts.\r\nYou need 1xpart1, 2xpart2, and 1xpart3.\r\nYou can use more part2's if you want.\r\n\r\nI initially had recessed nuts and bolts on the parts because i like how they look, but they didn't work very well.  When i moved the lamp, the couplings got tighter or looser, and it needed to adjusted all the time.\r\n\r\nNow i have removed the recessed nuts, and i use a bolt and nyloc nut to hold each coupling together.  I fit a single M4 washer between the plastic parts to provide consistent friction.\r\nThe coupling can be moved repeatedly, without the friction changing, so it can be moved into position and it will stay there.  You can adjust the friction by adjusting the tension on the bolt.\r\n\r\nI can push the lamp out of the way to do something, the push it back, and it will stay there.  I can re-orient the lamp and it stays where i put it, without needing adjustment to the couplings."
