    okh:function "Presenting a simple tripod design.  Choose between two styles of the tripod body.  One builds with the 3 leg holes facing upward.  The other is modifed with the leg holes facing downward.  Two top styles are available, a simple small one, or a larger one with ribs underneath.  Leg length, neck length can be whatever you want them to be.  The top of the tripod can easily be redone to suit your needs, I thought of making a calculator stand, a connector for my webcam..... For the legs and neck I used wooden dowels.  These could be printed easily also.  This tripod is very strong, one day I might do a failure test to see how much weight it can tolerate." ;
