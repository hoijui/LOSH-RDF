function: "This project began when my son chose to investigate block and tackle for his 1st grade science fair project.  I was going to zip down to the local Home Depot and buy the supplies, but then thought, \xE2\u20AC\u0153I should just print em!\xE2\u20AC\x9D.  I iterated the design a couple of times before I printed the first full assembly.  Then printed 3 more full assemblies.  Works great!  You will see that there are two types of sheaves, a single and double.  The double actually should have been two separate thin sheaves next to each other within the pulley plates.  The rope had very little friction, so I don't think much advantage was lost.  Wooden dowels (1/4\xE2\u20AC\x9D) were used to hold the hooks, eyes and sheaves between the side plates.  You can decide whether to use a hook or eye on each end."
