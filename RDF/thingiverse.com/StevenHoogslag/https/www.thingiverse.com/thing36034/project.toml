function = "The beautiful BFB 3000 and 3D-Touch printer comes with a loose top-lid. To avoid damage and scratches I made these hinges. They lock at 100 degrees so the top stays in the open position automatically. The hinges snap on the printer body without any modification. The top can easily be separated and locked-on again."
