function = "This is a rear wing for a 1/14 scale buggy or truggy. It is designed specifically for the Losi Mini 8ight but would probably work well with the Mini E-Revo or the RC18\r\n\r\nThis is the third version with minor changes each time. I am still working out the best way to print it, i have been printing it on its back with a raft but have encountered some minor problems.\r\n\r\nFeel free to take and modify it to fit your model"
