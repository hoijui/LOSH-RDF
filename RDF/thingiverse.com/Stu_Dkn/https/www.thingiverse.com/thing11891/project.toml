function = "A revised Z motor mount with thrust bearing and coupling.\r\n\r\nI didn't like the idea of the weight of the x-axis pulling down on the motor shaft and the possibility of the coupling slipping (although nopheads redesign has worked perfectly).\r\n\r\nWith this design all the weight is on the thrust bearing not the motor, and so far the threaded bar has run perfectly true giving some very nice prints.\r\n\r\nThe thrust bearing I found quite easily on ebay at Â£7.00 for 4, and have an 8mm ID and a 16mm OD."
