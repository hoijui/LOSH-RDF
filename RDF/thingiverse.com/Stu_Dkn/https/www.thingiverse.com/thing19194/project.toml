function = "This is a mount for an LCD keypad that I'm intending to use with the excellent SJFW firmware on my mendelmax. There is also a position for a small piece of vero board to mount connectors and resisters for the LEDs etc.\r\n\r\nThe two large holes are 20mm diameter and will take a standard illuminated automotive switch as found on ebay, one will be used for the printer on/off and the second will control the strips of LEDs I will fit along the inside of the frame for printing in the dark :-). The five small holes on the bottom right are for LEDs to show when the heated bed and hot end etc are active with space to the left for labels.\r\n\r\nThe keypad is sticky backed, and there is a small slot for the ribbon cable.\r\n\r\nThis is also one of the largest single objects I have printed as it only just fits on my prusa.\r\n\r\nSwitches have arrived, see the new picture."
