function: "As I quite often leave my printer running when I'm out the wife wanted an easy way to stop the printer if anything goes wrong. (I have no idea what she can mean ;-)  )\r\nAnyway I bought an emergency stop button from china (ebay) and this is the resulting bracket.\r\n\r\nThere are two versions one that fits around the corner bracket and another without the cut out.\r\n\r\nIt's just a shame I had run out of black ABS."
