\r
I was reading the latest of the MLP comic books when I looked at Chrysalisâ€™s horn and thought â€œhey i can make thatâ€x9d...so here it is.\r
 \r
At present the model is at what I perceive to be 1:1 (Being a cartoon size is really whatever I determine it to be) and measures in at about 320mm from base to peak. \r
I have split the model up into 5 pieces each with a flat surface to print on once rotated and so that little to no support material is required. I have uploaded the full model as well if you are feeling game.\r
\r
 You will find the original Solidworks file in the downloads as well if you what to edit it, cut it differently or whatever you feel like really.\r
\r
Tell me if you want any other file types and Iâ€™ll see what I can do.\r
