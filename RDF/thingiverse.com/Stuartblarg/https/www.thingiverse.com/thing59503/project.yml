function: "Horn of Chrysalis, the changeling queen from the show My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic\r\n\r\nI was reading the latest of the MLP comic books when I looked at Chrysalis\xE2\u20AC\u2122s horn and thought \xE2\u20AC\u0153hey i can make that\xE2\u20AC\x9D...so here it is.\r\n \r\nAt present the model is at what I perceive to be 1:1 (Being a cartoon size is really whatever I determine it to be) and measures in at about 320mm from base to peak. \r\nI have split the model up into 5 pieces each with a flat surface to print on once rotated and so that little to no support material is required. I have uploaded the full model as well if you are feeling game.\r\n\r\n You will find the original Solidworks file in the downloads as well if you what to edit it, cut it differently or whatever you feel like really.\r\n\r\nTell me if you want any other file types and I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ll see what I can do.\r\nFriendship is Magic (c) Hasbro"
