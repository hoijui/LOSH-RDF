function = "This a jig that I made up for accurately gluing the arm sections of the Delta-Pi Reprap 3D Printer. \r\n\r\nIt is made up of layers of 3mm MDF, laser cut to house the pivot sections, with a base part to set the length. \r\n\r\nAll the layers are held together with 8 1/8\"x25mm bolts. \r\n\r\nNOTE: In the picture the bottom layers are acrylic but that is not required it was just what material I had laying around."
