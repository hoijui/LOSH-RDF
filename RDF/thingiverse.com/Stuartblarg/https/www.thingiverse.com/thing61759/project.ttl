\r
It is made up of layers of 3mm MDF, laser cut to house the pivot sections, with a base part to set the length. \r
\r
All the layers are held together with 8 1/8"x25mm bolts. \r
\r
NOTE: In the picture the bottom layers are acrylic but that is not required it was just what material I had laying around.""" ;
