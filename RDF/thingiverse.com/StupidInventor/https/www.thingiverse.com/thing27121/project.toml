function = "Desktop Bat-Signal!\r\n\r\nOne of my goals when getting the Replicator was to make my own personal bat signal.\r\n\r\nI set a goal to get this finished for the Dark Night Rises opening weekend and here it is!\r\n\r\nMy 3D-Modeling skills are not the best, so I'll upload the design files later this weekend so more experience users can customize and improve my iniital design.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 07-26-12: Original files have been uploaded. Still haven't made the proper scaling changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.StupidInventor.com\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/Stupidinventions"
