function = "We printed this part in PLA to fit into a 3-1/4 inch (82.55 mm) diameter coffee can.  It is used as a stand to let acetone fumes smooth and finish the surface of an ABS part.  \r\n\r\nOne issue is that acetone crystallizes PLA and makes it brittle.  After repeated use you may need to print a new stand."
