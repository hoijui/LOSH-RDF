function = "[Blink Dagger from Dota 2](http://www.dota2wiki.com/images/a/a5/Bane_blink_03.mp3 )   \n   \nUse it to teleport instantaneously* to any position up to 12 units away. Goes on 3 second cooldown if you have just been attacked.  \n*does not actually allow teleportation, do not attempt to do so. I will not take any responsibility for any injuries which are the result of your own stupidity.  \n\nEdit: Added the actual Tide Hunter blink dagger. Ideal  size for this on a 200 x 200mm print bed is around 1.6x the model size."
