function: So you have your soul gem... but you've run out of hope for the planet... what're you going to do? Transform into a witch of course! Now, the first thing you're going to need is a grief seed... but because you were cheap and printed one, it's not going to transform on it's own. So... you're going to have to print the grief seed too. (5 hours of work in Solidworks)
