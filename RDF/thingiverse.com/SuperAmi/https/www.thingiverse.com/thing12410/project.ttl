    okh:function """This is just a quick coin tray that I made.  I started with a minimal one, but it didn't print well, I then moved on to a printable straight tray designed for one roll of coins.  Then I created this offset one.  Each of the three designs are in the scad, and each one corresponds to one roll of coins.\r
\r
The STL files are for 2â‚¬, 1â‚¬, 0.50â‚¬, 0.20â‚¬ and 0.10â‚¬ coins respectively.  They are also adjusted to the tolerances of my Thingomatic Mk6.  The scad has a parametric cointray() module, that can easily be adjusted to any size coin, as well as any number of coins per counting offset, or to a different printing tolerance.\r
\r
The counting tray is easy to load and unload, and should be useful to anyone who needs to count small amounts of change.\r
\r
I had originally planned on printing them all on one tray, but that is larger than will fit in my printing bed.""" ;
