function = "This is the coupling piece between the metal shaft of the mixing wand and the plastic motor connection on the body.\r\n\r\nYou can buy a replacement (for example here http://braun-service-station.de/Braun-Ersatzteile-Zubehoer/Ersatzteile-Haushalt/Ersatzteile-Mixstaebe/Ersatzteile-Stabmixer-Typ-4191/Plastikkupplung-fuer-Plastik--und-Metallschaft-Braun-Stabmixer-Typ-4191--67050811.html), but I had already mocked this up before I even bothered to look.\r\n\r\nI included the SCAD file for others to tweak.  It includes an optional gap for a rubber o ring that is present in the original piece.  Unfortunately it didn't print well for me with the gap.  Fortunately it appears to work without the ring.\r\n\r\nThe blender_repair_gap.stl is the higher resolution file with the accurate shaft dimensions and the gap for the o-ring."
