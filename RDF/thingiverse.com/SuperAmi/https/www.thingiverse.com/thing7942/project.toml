function = "After printing the calliper holder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7206, I was inspired to make a holder for my tweezers and right angle.  It is designed to fit my Thing-O-Matic by simply hanging over the edge of the top with a grip on the inside.  Minor modification should allow it to work with a cupcake as well.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that most of you do not have the same constellation of right angle and 4 tweezers, like I do, but I hope that the OpenSCAD file will help you create your own over the edge tool holder."
