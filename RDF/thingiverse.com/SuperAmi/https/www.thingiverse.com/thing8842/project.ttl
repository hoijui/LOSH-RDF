\r
Here are two different classic style risk men.  My personal favorite or the roman numerals.  They make counting the units in a territory quick and easy.  Then there are the star form.  As I didn't know exactly how many pieces a player needs, I did some heavy google searching to come up with a rough ratio.\r
\r
Star form => 40:20:10\r
Roman Numeral form => 40:16:16:8\r
You will need to print 2 sheets of your desired form for each player\r
\r
\r
3 peaks => 1 army\r
4 peaks => 5 armies\r
5 peaks => 10 armies\r
\r
\r
I have included the source SCAD files for those who want to adjust the size or style.  You can actually fit all the pieces onto one print with the Thing-O-Matic, IF you do not need a raft.""" ;
