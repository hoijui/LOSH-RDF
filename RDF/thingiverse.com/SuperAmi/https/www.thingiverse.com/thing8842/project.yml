function: "Love Risk?  Hate those toy soldiers the new versions come with?  Or have you just lost too many pieces?\r\n\r\nHere are two different classic style risk men.  My personal favorite or the roman numerals.  They make counting the units in a territory quick and easy.  Then there are the star form.  As I didn't know exactly how many pieces a player needs, I did some heavy google searching to come up with a rough ratio.\r\n\r\nStar form => 40:20:10\r\nRoman Numeral form => 40:16:16:8\r\nYou will need to print 2 sheets of your desired form for each player\r\n\r\n\r\n3 peaks => 1 army\r\n4 peaks => 5 armies\r\n5 peaks => 10 armies\r\n\r\n\r\nI have included the source SCAD files for those who want to adjust the size or style.  You can actually fit all the pieces onto one print with the Thing-O-Matic, IF you do not need a raft."
