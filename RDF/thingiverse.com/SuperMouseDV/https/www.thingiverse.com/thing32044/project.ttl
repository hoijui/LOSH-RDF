Jamesm1 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19818\r
\r
I remodeled it to allow maximum tension on the belts. \r
Allows room for more tension down the road by Opening up the mount holes. This is My first THING \r
and I seen other tensioners on here and this one fit the bill better than most. Very Firm grasp on the belt and with it you can Tune your belts to play music on (ok not that tense :)  ) I may reprint them now that my accuracy has went through the roof.  But the originals are doing very nicely.""" ;
