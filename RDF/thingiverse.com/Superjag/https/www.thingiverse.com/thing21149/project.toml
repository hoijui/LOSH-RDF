function = "A bluetooth communicator badge for those who need to communicate with their orbiting starship. (or with friends or co-workers via the cellular system)\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you could carry this in your shirt pocket, and use voice command to quickly call people at the other end of the house, rather than having to pull out your phone or (gasp) get up off the sofa. Its usefulness is really dependent on good voice-command software in the phone that you pair it with, otherwise it would just be more convenient to dial the call directly.\r\n\r\nNote that the badge does not have a speaker - you'll have to somehow get your phone to use speakerphone when you take calls using the badge. It does have a microphone for (hopefully) improved call quality on the other end, and an instant voice-dial / answer call button."
