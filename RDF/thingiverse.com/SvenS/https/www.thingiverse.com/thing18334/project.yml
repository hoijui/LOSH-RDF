function: "Ever heard someone say \"iBricked my phone!!\"?\r\nNow you can join in on the fun with this brand new accessory for iPhone 4!\r\n\r\nNote: I wasn't able to print this for lack of a printer. the \"Clearance\"-variables in the OpenSCAD may need adjustment so the phone will fit nicely. I don't expect any problems printing though ;)\r\n\r\nAnotherNote: To compile the scad file you will need this iPhone model to be located in the same folder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3392"
