function = "This is a Toothbrush holder that is placed on top of a glass. It is designed with OpenScad. If you like you can go into the OpenScad Script and change the number of Toothbrushes, tubes, diameter of the cap or the height of the cones where the Toothbrushes are placed. The cones will keep the brushes from touching the bottom of the glass this keeps them clean and dry.  \r\n(Translation to perfect english by MoonWalker)\r\n\r\nThe stl has following parameters:\r\n        cap_outer_diameter = 76;\r\n\tcap_inner_diameter = 72;\r\n\tglass_inner_height = 80;\r\n\tbottom_gap = 10;\r\n\tnumber_of_toothbrushes = 4;\r\n\tnumber_of_tubes = 2;\r\n\ttoothbrush_tophole_diameter = 10;\r\n\ttube_tophole_diameter = 20;\r\n\twallthickness = 2;\r\n\tdripping_hole_diameter = 4; \r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\ttoothbrush_tophole_diameter = 15;\r\n\ttube_tophole_diameter = 30;\r\nare more realistic!
