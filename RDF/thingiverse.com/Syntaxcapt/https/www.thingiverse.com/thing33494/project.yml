function: "This is a fan duct that can be attached over top of a fan to force air more towards the extruder tip.   Potentially giving better PLA prints.\r\nI always found that printing certain parts in PLA on the 3d touch can be messy (especially small, high res parts with large over hangs).\r\n\r\nI did some test prints and they turned out really good using the increased air flow and having it directed near the nozzle tip.\r\nEven large flat PLA parts came out really well!"
