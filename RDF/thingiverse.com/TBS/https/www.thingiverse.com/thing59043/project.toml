function = "This model is a drinking cup made out of one long, spiraled up drinking straw. If you suck on the end the fluid will go from the bottom of the glass down and spiral back up again till it comes out of the end.  \n\nIt should be noted that cleaning this thing is a pain and it might not be completely watertight when printed with most consumer printers (however mine only leaks so slow it would take several hours for all the fluid to completely leak out)."
