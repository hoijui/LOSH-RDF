    okh:function """My first step to designing a full miniature.\r
The pattern on the boots has a width of .25 mm.\r
They sit on a 25mm base.\r
Everything is parametric in the OpenSCAD file. You can make them longer, shorter, wider, higher, as you like. So you should be able to make e.g. a women's shoe while the design stay in place.\r
\r
I used a neat trick to make the pattern on the irregular shaped shoe. To make a line I cut out a cube with the thickness of the line width (xline) out of the body. Than I scale the original body by (x_dimension-xline)/x_dimension, in every direction, and superimpose it.\r
\r
The stl was repeared (and shrunk by a factor 5 in size) by netfab.Thanx.\r
\r
The zip contains all files.\r
\r
Enjoy.""" ;
