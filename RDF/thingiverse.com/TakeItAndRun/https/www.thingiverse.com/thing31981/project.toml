function = "Print out one set.\r\n\r\nFill in one uncooked egg.\r\n\r\nClose lid tightly.\r\n\r\nBoil 3 to 5 minutes, as desired.\r\n\r\nSurprise your spouse with breakfast in bed with your own selfmade square eggs. \r\n\r\n(Don't try tell her you printed them out, she may not want to eat them than.)\r\n\r\nHey, anybody ever tought of printing direktly with egg yolk/ egg white?\r\n\r\nEgg solidifys at a nice, low temperature of 45(?) degree celcius.\r\n\r\nCorrection:\r\nDas Eiklar besteht aus zwei Arten von EiweiÃŸ: dem Ovalbumin und dem Conalbumin. Das Conalbumin beginnt bei 61.5Â°C und das Ovalbumin bei 84.5Â°C zu gerinnen. Der Dotter beginnt bei 65Â°C zu stocken.\r\n\r\nSo 60-80 degree celcius are needed to print in egg.\r\n\r\nOr go all the way: add printing with calcium and print your very own eggs in any shape you like.\r\n\r\nMaybe man could finally get rid of mass hen factories?\r\n\r\nIn the OpenSCAD file you can set the volume of the egg to how big eggs in your neck of the wood are.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_egg_sizes\r\n\r\nSays the most commanly sold eggs in Amerika are large (L) with 46ml.\r\n\r\nIn Europe this corresponces to a medium egg.\r\n\r\nThis, I have set it to 46ml."
