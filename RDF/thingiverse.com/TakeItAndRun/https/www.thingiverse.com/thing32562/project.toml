function = "House inspired by playing hours of MineCraft.\r\n\r\nWithout a pattern the model just look boring. Thus I choose an easy to print one.\r\n\r\nYou can design your own by placing 1's and 0's in the array in the OpenSCAD-file. Leave a row of 0's around it because this is used to check if a pattern has to be applied to the outside of a block.\r\n\r\nOne word of caution: dont have two blocks touch only diagonal. They will have only one edge in commen and the resulting stl will not be, as OpenSCAD calls it, a two-fold manifold. Thus it throughs an error and it will not be printable anyhow."
