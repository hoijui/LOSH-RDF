    okh:function """Updated with current prices and has:-  



Large letter slot that is now 250mm x 25mm  



and the Letter slot which is now 165mm x 5mm  



It also now includes Packet pricing for UK first class packets from 1kg upwards.. Packets above 1kg can only be 1st class  



Prices seem to have gone up by 10%-12%  

The larger the item or its weight  

The price increase seems to be more like 10% than 12%  



NOTE! When using this if you have to put ANY pressure on the letter or package to get it through it is a FAIL!!.  



If you item falls straight through the intended slot it is OK.  



You can not cheat on this!! "ANY" pressure required to get it through it will cost more to post as the item being posted moves up from a letter to a large letter or from a Large Letter to a Packet,""" ;
