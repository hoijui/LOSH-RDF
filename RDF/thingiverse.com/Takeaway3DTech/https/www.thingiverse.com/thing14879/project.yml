function: "Updated with current prices and has:-  \n\n\n\nLarge letter slot that is now 250mm x 25mm  \n\n\n\nand the Letter slot which is now 165mm x 5mm  \n\n\n\nIt also now includes Packet pricing for UK first class packets from 1kg upwards.. Packets above 1kg can only be 1st class  \n\n\n\nPrices seem to have gone up by 10%-12%  \n\nThe larger the item or its weight  \n\nThe price increase seems to be more like 10% than 12%  \n\n\n\nNOTE! When using this if you have to put ANY pressure on the letter or package to get it through it is a FAIL!!.  \n\n\n\nIf you item falls straight through the intended slot it is OK.  \n\n\n\nYou can not cheat on this!! \"ANY\" pressure required to get it through it will cost more to post as the item being posted moves up from a letter to a large letter or from a Large Letter to a Packet,"
