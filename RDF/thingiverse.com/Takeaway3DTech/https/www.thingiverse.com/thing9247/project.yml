function: "All of the extra cutting lines removed from the original DXF drawings and a 7 coaster set added for house hold use and the original 3 coaster set for workshop use.  \n\n\n\nUsed this as a learning exercise for testing and setting up an old 50W Universal M-300 laser cutter.  \n\n\n\nThe engraving is now vector engraving as Raster engraving not working on this old laser cutter. ;-( Engineer is booked to come out and fix it. So was a good test peice."
