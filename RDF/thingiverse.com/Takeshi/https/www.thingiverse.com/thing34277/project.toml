function = "I detailed Bre's scan of a plaster deer head. I left it full poly, 330k, since it's still 1/3 of the count of the Black Dynamite bust (which I can only assume is the standard:). I also added a hole on the back for hanging it in your den.  \nMade for my 1.5yo daughter who is obsessed with deer and bats. She loves little animal models, I love printing things with the Replicator. It's a symbiotic relationship."
