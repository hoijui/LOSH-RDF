The NYLON coffee filter was printed on a 2BEIGH3 3D Printer as this printer is capable of printing with NYLON.  Details of the printer can be seen at: http://www.instructables.com/id/Combination-CNC-Machine-and-3D-Printer/\r
NYLON is the industry material-of-choice for permanent coffee filters.  With NYLONâ€™s absorption in conjunction with a controlled perimeter and fill, a coffee filter that suitâ€™s the individual is as easy as hitting the â€œprint buttonâ€!  And like name brand filters, this filter is dishwasher safe.""" ;
