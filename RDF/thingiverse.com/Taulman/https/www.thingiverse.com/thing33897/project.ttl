    okh:function "Iâ€™ve started 3D Printing UAV fuselages for a friend thatâ€™s starting out in the hobby.  He uses the â€œBixlerâ€x9d type frames with some horizon sensors to get started.  As we all know, there seems to be a greater number of tall obstacles as we start flying and itâ€™s been no different for him.  Having crashed several of his foam and foam covered planes, he asked for help.  Iâ€™ve now printed about 5 fuselages of different sizes and different shapes, all based on the â€œBixlerâ€x9d style he requested.  These are 3D Printed as shown but in 3D Printing Nylon.  Theyâ€™re printed hollow and 3-4 perimeters.  Due to being printed in a circular pattern, he is extremely pleased with the light weight and axial stability of the completed fuselage.  Very little twist in 3 â€“ 4 perimeter components.  He is also very pleased that even with several rough landings and a telephone pole or two, heâ€™s reported no damage at all due to nylonâ€™s pliability and strength." ;
