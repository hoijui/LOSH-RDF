function: "I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve started 3D Printing UAV fuselages for a friend that\xE2\u20AC\u2122s starting out in the hobby.  He uses the \xE2\u20AC\u0153Bixler\xE2\u20AC\x9D type frames with some horizon sensors to get started.  As we all know, there seems to be a greater number of tall obstacles as we start flying and it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s been no different for him.  Having crashed several of his foam and foam covered planes, he asked for help.  I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve now printed about 5 fuselages of different sizes and different shapes, all based on the \xE2\u20AC\u0153Bixler\xE2\u20AC\x9D style he requested.  These are 3D Printed as shown but in 3D Printing Nylon.  They\xE2\u20AC\u2122re printed hollow and 3-4 perimeters.  Due to being printed in a circular pattern, he is extremely pleased with the light weight and axial stability of the completed fuselage.  Very little twist in 3 \xE2\u20AC\u201C 4 perimeter components.  He is also very pleased that even with several rough landings and a telephone pole or two, he\xE2\u20AC\u2122s reported no damage at all due to nylon\xE2\u20AC\u2122s pliability and strength."
