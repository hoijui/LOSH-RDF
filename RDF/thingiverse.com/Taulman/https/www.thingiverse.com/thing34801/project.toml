function = "This simple object is used to test for delamination resistance and pliability of 618 nylon material.\r\n  A six sided object 50mm wide by 114 mm tall.  \r\n  The part is printed hollow at worse case settings for delamination testing. One perimeter and one solid layer.\r\n  The intent is to insure that stretching of the material occurs before any delamination of thread to thread bonds and that pliability is symmetrical."
