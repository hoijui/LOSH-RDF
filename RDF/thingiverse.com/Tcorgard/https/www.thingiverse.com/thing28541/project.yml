function: "I liked the clips made by Nben. But I like to use Polycarbonate/Lexan instead of Plexiglass. I found 11\" by 18\" sheets which are easier to cut down for the side windows. \r\n\r\nI also figured if I leave the bolts a little loose and add a small handle, I could remove the side windows if needed without removing the bolts.\r\n\r\nI have included the single print files as well.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has comments on how I can improve these, please let me know."
