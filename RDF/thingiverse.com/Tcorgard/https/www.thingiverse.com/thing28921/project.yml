function: "This is the radio you first see before you black out and get taken to The Sierra Madre. In Dead Money for Fallout New Vegas.\r\n\r\nIt is close, i drew it from just a screen capture of the front. I could play the game again and get it much closer, but will have to wait and see.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I relooked at my CAD file and noticed it was not curvy enough for a 50's style radio, so I softened a bunch of edges. Radio_v2.stl should be more realistic."
