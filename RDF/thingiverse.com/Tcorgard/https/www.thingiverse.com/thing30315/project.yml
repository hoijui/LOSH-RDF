function: "I made my dad a cigarette case on my printer, so I thought I might aswell draw up a ash tray aswell for him. The first one I did was a little deep, but still worked. \r\n\r\nI have uploaded a shallow one, and the deep one.\r\n\r\nWarning, ABS is highly flammable. But it was teh only material I had. It should work, just don't put it near a open flame."
