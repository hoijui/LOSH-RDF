All you need is a coffee cup, some card stock, and the printable MIC CHK (microphone check) clip. Once assembled, like the movie directors of yore, you can make yourself heard loudly and clearly.\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/hlzPJrGIbTo\r\n\r\nPrint out a bunch and bring them to your next gathering!\r\n\r\nShare your voice. Save your voice."
