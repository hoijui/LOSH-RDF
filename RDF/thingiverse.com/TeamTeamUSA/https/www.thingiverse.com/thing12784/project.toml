function = "UPDATE 2011-10-25\r\nI uploaded shell-012948.stl, the file as exported from Sage, for shell thickening experimentation. It was mirrored from the original exported file because a hermit crab needs a right-handed shell spiral due to the way its abdomen curves.\r\n\r\nPimp out your hermit crab!\r\n\r\nThis is the prototype shell for Project Shellter, the current artist residency at MakerBot Industries.\r\n\r\nIt is modeled on the shell of the Cittarium pica sea snail, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cittarium_pica, and is similar to the ones that crabs in pet stores typically sport.\r\n\r\nIt was created using Sage, http://sagemath.org, exported to an STL using a modified version of Christopher Olah's plugin, http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7744, and thickened in 3DS Max.\r\n\r\nYou can explore other shell shapes here http://sagenb.org/home/pub/2928 (account required).\r\n\r\nThe goal is a workflow using open source tools, but the conversion of the surface to a solid at this point requires a commercial tool.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone can figure out a way to thicken the surface without 3DS Maxâ€½\r\n\r\nFollow Project Shellter progress here:\r\n\r\nhttp://projectshellter.com\r\nhttp://twitter.com/ProjectShellter\r\nhttp://bit.ly/ProjectShellter\r\nhttp://bit.ly/ProjectShellterCams\r\nhttp://bit.ly/ProjectShellterVideos"
