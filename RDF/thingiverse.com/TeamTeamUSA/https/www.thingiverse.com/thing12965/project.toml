function = "Dyn-o-Mite! err... I mean Amm-o-nite!\r\n\r\nThis proof-of-concept is modeled on the shell of an Ammonite, a prehistoric ancestor of cuttlefish and octopi http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonite.\r\n\r\nThis is the first shell from which a printable STL was created, and its creation spurred the continued development of Project Shellter.\r\n\r\nIt was created using the Maya shellNode plugin and thickened using 3DS Max (still looking for an open source thickening solution!).\r\n\r\nNot-so-Good News: the shellNode plugin is only available as C++ source code in the Maya SDK.\r\n\r\nGood News: AutoDesk, the developer of Maya and 3DS Max, is helping out the 99% with their Educational and Professionals Assistance program. If you're a student, teacher, veteran, or unemployed individual who has previously worked in the architecture, engineering, design or manufacturing industries you can get AutoDesk software through their assistance program: http://students.autodesk.com/?nd=register"
