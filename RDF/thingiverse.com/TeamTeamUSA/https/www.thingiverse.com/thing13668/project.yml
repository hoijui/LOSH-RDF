function: "Back in the day when the Beastie Boys dropped their groundbreaking \"Paul's Boutique,\" researcher M. B. Cortie dropped another masterpiece - \"Models for Mollusc Shell Shape.\" In it was described a 16 parameter mathematical model for synthetic seashells, and parameters for many species of molluscs were thoughtfully provided in the appendix. This is one of them.   \n\nModeled on the shell of the Turritella communis sea snail, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritella_communis, will Purple Pincher hermit crabs like this? Only experimentation will tell!  \n\nIt was created using Maya's shellNode plugin, which is based upon Cortie's model, and thickened using Blender's Solidify modifier http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-256-beta/solidify-modifier/.  \n\nThe goal is a workflow using open source tools, but this shell surface required a commercial tool. Thanks to a tip from http://www.thingiverse.com/mesheldrake, the conversion to a solid is now handled by an open source tool. :)  \n\nCortie's model and many of its resultant shells have been written in Maple http://www.maplesoft.com/applications/view.aspx?SID=3851&view=html. Porting them to Sage is the last step in creating a complete open source workflow.  \n\nAny takers?  \n\nFollow Project Shellter progress here:  \n\nhttp://projectshellter.com  \nhttp://twitter.com/ProjectShellter  \nhttp://bit.ly/ProjectShellter  \nhttp://bit.ly/ProjectShellterCams  \nhttp://bit.ly/ProjectShellterVideos"
