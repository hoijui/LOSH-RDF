UPDATE 02012-12-15: Meeting went great; beginning collaboration with WinSenga team in 2013! First order of business is obtaining an antenatal care medical manikin/simulator. Anyone have one they want to donate?\r
\r
UPDATE 02012-12-04: Excited to meet the WinSenga team this week! They're in the US taking meetings and receiving their Microsoft Imagine Cup award.\r
\r
Inspired by the awesome work of the WinSenga team http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120927-mobile-ear-for-pregnancy-problems, this is a MakerBottable Pinard horn http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinard_horn, a 19th century fetal stethoscope. This MakerSenga - senga is the local Ugandan name for midwife - can be used to diagnose fetal health by a trained practitioner or, paired with the end cap microphone, by anyone with the WinSenga software!\r
