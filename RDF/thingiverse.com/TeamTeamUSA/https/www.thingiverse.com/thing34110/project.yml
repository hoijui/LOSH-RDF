function: "\"Every minute, at least one woman dies from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth\"\r\n-World Health Organization http://www.who.int/features/qa/12/en/index.html\r\n\r\nUPDATE 02012-12-15: Meeting went great; beginning collaboration with WinSenga team in 2013! First order of business is obtaining an antenatal care medical manikin/simulator. Anyone have one they want to donate?\r\n\r\nUPDATE 02012-12-04: Excited to meet the WinSenga team this week! They're in the US taking meetings and receiving their Microsoft Imagine Cup award.\r\n\r\nInspired by the awesome work of the WinSenga team http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120927-mobile-ear-for-pregnancy-problems, this is a MakerBottable Pinard horn http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinard_horn, a 19th century fetal stethoscope. This MakerSenga - senga is the local Ugandan name for midwife - can be used to diagnose fetal health by a trained practitioner or, paired with the end cap microphone, by anyone with the WinSenga software!\r\n\r\nBy Miles Lightwood of TeamTeamUSA.\r\n\r\nCommunity health worker photo by Sven Torfin"
