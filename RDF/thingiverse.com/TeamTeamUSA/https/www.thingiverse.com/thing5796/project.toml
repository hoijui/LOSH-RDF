function = "Up your sartorial game!\r\n\r\nThis mash-up of the \"MakerBot M,\" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4390 and the \"Cufflink backside curved,\" http://www.shapeways.com/model/68390/cufflink_backside_curved.html will let you discreetly rock the big M at your next formal event.\r\n\r\nThe M's edges are radiused to protect your finest gear; Jacob The Jeweler-esque bling is optional!\r\n\r\nAll STL files are 100%. The cufflink in the photo was printed at 80% using the  Makerbot M Cufflink.stl file because 100% was a bit too large for me; scale to suit the suit.\r\n\r\nThe current versions of these files require support material:\r\n\r\n* MakerBot M Cufflink.stl\r\n* Cufflink backside curved.stl\r\n\r\n2011-01-31 UPDATE\r\nSupported version uploaded: Makerbot_M_Cufflink_Supported.stl. The overhangs are supported by sprues that need to be removed after printing. This hasn't been printed, but it should work. Please let me know, so I can remove the WIP banner. ViaCAD 3D file also uploaded.\r\n\r\n2011-01-25 UPDATE\r\nVersions that do not require support material are in the works."
