\r
This mash-up of the "MakerBot M," http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4390 and the "Cufflink backside curved," http://www.shapeways.com/model/68390/cufflink_backside_curved.html will let you discreetly rock the big M at your next formal event.\r
\r
The M's edges are radiused to protect your finest gear; Jacob The Jeweler-esque bling is optional!\r
\r
All STL files are 100%. The cufflink in the photo was printed at 80% using the  Makerbot M Cufflink.stl file because 100% was a bit too large for me; scale to suit the suit.\r
\r
The current versions of these files require support material:\r
\r
* MakerBot M Cufflink.stl\r
* Cufflink backside curved.stl\r
\r
2011-01-31 UPDATE\r
Supported version uploaded: Makerbot_M_Cufflink_Supported.stl. The overhangs are supported by sprues that need to be removed after printing. This hasn't been printed, but it should work. Please let me know, so I can remove the WIP banner. ViaCAD 3D file also uploaded.\r
\r
2011-01-25 UPDATE\r
Versions that do not require support material are in the works.""" ;
