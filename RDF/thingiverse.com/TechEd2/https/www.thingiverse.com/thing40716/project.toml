function = "A stand to be used in conjunction with Thing 4941 by larsonmattr.  As designed it holds a 7/8\" diameter DC motor that works nicely to demonstrate the operation of a wind turbine.  There are three pieces that you glue together after printing.  There is an extra section on the bracket that must be cut off after printing.  It acts as a support while printing."
