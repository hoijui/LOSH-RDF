function = "This is the filament guide that we use on all our MakerBot 3D printers at all our TechShop locations.\r\n\r\nThis filament guide is easy to print, fits well within the build envelope of the Thing-O-Matic (it won't quite fit in the Cupcake's build envelope through), doesn't warp when printed, and uses a small amount of plastic.\r\n\r\nIt provides trouble-free filament feeding, and bolts to the top of your MakerBot into existing holes with just two machine screws.\r\n\r\nThis filament guide is designed to be used with the bolt-on spool holder mounted on the top of your MakerBot.  We mount our spool holder on top of the MakerBot at the front right corner, and we mount the filament guide in the holes on the top of the MakerBot in the front center.\r\n\r\nThe STL file can be downloaded from this post, as well as the editable Autodesk Inventor IPT file.\r\n\r\nDid you know that Autodesk deeply supports the Maker Movement?  You can download Autodesk Inventor for free if you are a student or educator, unemployed, or a veteran of the US military.  Please see this MakerBot blog entry for information: http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2011/10/28/awesome-autodesk/\r\n\r\nYou can also use the entire Autodesk Inventor suite of software on high-end graphics workstations for free as a TechShop member at any TechShop location.
