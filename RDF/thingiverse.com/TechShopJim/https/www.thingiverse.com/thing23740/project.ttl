    okh:function """This thing is a cover that blocks the daylight from reaching the daylight sensor on top of the dash of Ford cars, SUVs and trucks.\r
\r
On newer Ford cars, SUVs and trucks, there is a daylight sensor on the dashboard that turns on the headlights to about 80% power (DRLs, or "Daytime Running Lights"), and prevents the fill-in lights from turning on in the daytime.\r
\r
I like to have lots of light coming from the front of my car in the daytime so other drivers can see me coming more easily.\r
\r
Placing this cover over the sensor will cause the headlights to be at full power, and will allow the fill-in lights to be turned on in daylight conditions.\r
\r
You could use electrical tape to cover over the daylight sensor on your car, or you can print this cool cover on your MakerBot, Thing-O-Matic, Replicator, or variant.\r
\r
I designed this cover to fit the sensor on my 2008 Ford Expedition.  It also fits on the sensor on my wife's 2011 Ford Edge.  I'm not sure how far back Ford used this same sensor.  If your sensor looks like it is a shape that this cover will fit, then I guess you're in luck!\r
\r
I printed this on the Thing-O-Matic at TechShop, and also on my Replicator, and it seems to print pretty well at just about any settings that work for other items.""" ;
