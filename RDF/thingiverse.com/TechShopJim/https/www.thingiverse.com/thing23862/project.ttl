    okh:function """This thing is a simple cap that fits over the cap of a standard water or soda bottle, and holds your small snapshot camera so you can take a picture without having to rest the camera on a stick, railing, etc.\r
\r
I saw a soda bottle tripod thing here on ThingiVerse, but it was printed in 3 pieces and had to be glued together.  Plus it was thick and bulky and had a pivot ball that didn't fit into the socket correctly (it broke the socket when I pushed it in).  I designed this camera stand completely from scratch using Autodesk Inventor.  I printed it out using the Thing-O-Matic at TechShop and also on a Replicator.\r
\r
The little post that attaches to the camera's 1/4-20 threaded mount simply pushes in...you don't have to screw it in.  I'm not sure how many cycles this will work, but you can always print a new one if it wears out.  Also, I would advise that you unscrew the mount from the camera instead of pulling it straight out...there's a chance it could break off if you pull it.\r
\r
Be careful because the camera might be a little tippy on top of the soda or water bottle.  Be careful that the wind doesn't blow the whole thing over and break your camera!\r
\r
Enjoy!""" ;
