function: "I designed this case for my FasTrak pass circuit board because I was really sick of seeing the ugly bulky putty-colored block on my dashboard.\r\n\r\nThis new case is designed to blend in with most dashboard features.\r\n\r\nNote that there's no bottom half for this enclosure because it really isn't needed.  This enclosure is really just a cover for the FasTrak circuit board.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
