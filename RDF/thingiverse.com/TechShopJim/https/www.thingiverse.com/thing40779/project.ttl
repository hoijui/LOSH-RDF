\r
I was tired of not being able to read the BBQ temperature on the receiver because it was laying on the table.  There was a stand with this receiver, but it was flimsy and broke, then got lost.\r
\r
These "Weber Style" BBQ thermometers are available all over the place, and the are really great because you can monitor the temperature of the meat from in the comfort of your kitchen.""" ;
