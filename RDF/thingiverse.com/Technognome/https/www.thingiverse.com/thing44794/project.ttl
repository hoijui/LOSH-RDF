    okh:function """I liked Elmwolf's Tubes, i had been looking for some thing of that nature to be anble to keep separate items ,I need to take with me , when I go walking.For most of my things His tube was fine, but I needed something longer for some specific items> you see, I am a diabetic and had lost most of the use of my left arm, so I need a tube that held  my things,And that I didnt need to fiddle with to open. I hads take Elmwolfs original tube  cloned the female end, removed the closed end and merged the two open ends together. I had what I wanted.\r
If you are wondering what is supporting the lying tube, It is a mount I am developing for either a bandoleer or backpack straps , when I figure out which one and finish it I will upload it\r
