function = "for fun or cosplay this is the pattern of the Adam West buckle  (only thing missing is the slogan inscribed on the back of the buckle \" EVIL is,  WHO EVIL DOES\". It is  scaled down - so as  not to cleave  you in twain - the original was  4x 6 in-sorry about no photo- the paint I had used had solvent in it for the metallic color. it warped and twisted the original print abs- I had done  it in black . when I reprint it in yellow or gold I will add the photo\r\nI did this to celebrate the merchandising of the 1966 tv series and potential 2013 release of the show on dvd"
