It is  scaled down - so as  not to cleave  you in twain - the original was  4x 6 in-sorry about no photo- the paint I had used had solvent in it for the metallic color. it warped and twisted the original print abs- I had done  it in black . when I reprint it in yellow or gold I will add the photo\r
I did this to celebrate the merchandising of the 1966 tv series and potential 2013 release of the show on dvd""" ;
