function = "Miniture Piston Keychain has been modeled to have very low clean up required by adding supports & radii. I also separated the bigend to aid printing plus I think the little bolts give it a cool mechanical feel.\r\n\r\nParts Required:\r\n1) 2x M3 x 10mm socket head cap screws.\r\n2) 2x M3 nuts.\r\n\r\nAll should be available from a hardware store or fastening supply store."
