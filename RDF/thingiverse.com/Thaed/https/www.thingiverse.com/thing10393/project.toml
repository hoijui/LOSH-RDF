function = "I converted Birdman's Trilobite from Sketchup Warehouse to .stl.  It's actually a difficult print.  Skeinforge does some funky stuff with it.  You need to print it with a raft because it builds a foundation.  Even if you put it on the platform with Replicator G, it will still drive your print head into the platform if you don't use a raft.  Very strange."
