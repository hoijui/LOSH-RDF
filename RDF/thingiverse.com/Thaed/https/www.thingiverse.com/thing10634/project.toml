function = "Sometimes the story behind the object that you create is more valuable than the object itself.  You see, my wife is chronically organized and must keep a clean house always.  I, on the other hand, have a great deal of chaos in my blood.  Moreover, if I am not reminded of an object by seeing it, I forget that it exists.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case in point illustrates this perfectly.  My wife and I went to the library a few weeks ago and I got a half a dozen books.  At home, she immediately put them in a basket and I promptly forgot about them.  I was only reminded of the books 3 weeks later when the library emailed me about renewing them.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the shower this morning (where I do my best thinking) it occurred to me that I should put them on the desk in my lab where my dear wife does not willingly tread.  Then I thought that the books would get in the way unless I could organize them.  Of course!  I could print a book end!  And then the mental leap:  I could print a Laurie Anderson book end!!!  I jumped out of the shower to write it down so I wouldn't forget it before I dried off.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course it doesn't have to be Ms. Anderson, it could be Bre, Tony, Colbert or any of the other great busts."
