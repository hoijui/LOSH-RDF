function: What self-respecting nerd wouldn't have one of these things lying around?  Originally, I wanted it to be solar powered, but I had to settle for AAA batteries.  I scavenged the motor and propeller from a 6 in 1 educational solar kit.  There's no reason why you can't print your own propeller and use a motor from a cd player or really any motor.
