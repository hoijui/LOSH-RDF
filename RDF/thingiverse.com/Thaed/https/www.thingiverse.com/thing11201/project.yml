function: 'This is a small chest of drawers that you can put things like Allen keys in or other tiny objects like gold doubloons.  I''ve been working with ksuflash on trying to get Ohio Makerbot owners together and he whipped up a blog to that effect.  While I was trying to design this stupid thing, I put up a post  about it:  http://ohio-makerbot.blogspot.com/2011/08/sneak-peek-at-my-drawers.html'
