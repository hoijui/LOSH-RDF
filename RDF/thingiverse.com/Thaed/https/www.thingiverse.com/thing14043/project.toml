function = "I've been at it again.  When I did that I-beam some time ago, I made a desk shelf that I'm still using in my office.  The idea behind it is that a small shelf can sit on a desk and actually give you more surface area because you have an accessible second level.  Clearly, there are diminishing returns.  If you covered your desk with them, it wouldn't work so well.  One or two, though, can actually help.  You can see from the picture that from the year or so I've been at 3d printing, I've accumulated a lot of objects.  My wife, out of frustration, threw them in a box.  She seems to like the desk shelf though."
