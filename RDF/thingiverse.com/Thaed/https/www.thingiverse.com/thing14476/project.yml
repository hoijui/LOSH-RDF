function: I like having containers to hold small electronics parts or headphones or other objects to keep them from running around inside my briefcase.  I've been using a more rectangular case I made for months now.  The thing with that one is that it has sharp corners and I often end up poking and scraping my hands.  That won't happen with this design.
