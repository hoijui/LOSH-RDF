function = "This project box features a slot where a nine volt battery may be lovingly ensconsed to power simple electronics projects using the Radio Shack Board. The board itself makes its home quite nicely inside and has optional wire tension posts to relieve stressed connections.  Lids may be added later.  The board measures 1 3/4 x 3 5/8\"."
