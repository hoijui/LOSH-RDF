function: This is a Buddha scan I found on Sketchup Warehouse.  I really liked the detail and it printed fairly well on my ToM using the MK7.  I still don't have the MK7 configured properly as my prints are a little squished.  In this case Buddha doesn't mind.  In fact he said I should not worry, nor should I be attached to how he looks or be judgmental.  Instead I should surrender to the moment and live in the now.
