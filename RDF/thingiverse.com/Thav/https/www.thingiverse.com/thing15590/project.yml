function: "This thing is meant to be a jig for cutting dovetails in wood. It is parametric, so if you enter the thickness and width of wood you are trying to join, it will create a reasonable number of dovetails for small widths, maybe up to 6\". Beyond that it might take some modification to make the dovetails wider.\r\n\r\nIt has not been printed yet. It may need to be turned over before printing, because one part of the jig has overhangs that probably can't be bridged."
