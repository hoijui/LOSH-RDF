\r
Another quickie model made for people to have fun with!\r
When printed this model should stand about five inches tall!\r
\r
This one is a mostly static model; being new to having a printer I have yet to determine how much movable parts can be made with the printers so I didn't want to (yet) try pushing my limits.\r
\r
Being a quickie model there are a few errors on it, but they shouldn't prevent the model from printing correctly. I tried to prevent any undercuts on it; if I missed any please let me know!\r
\r
(I would like to note that due to the ABP on the makerbot I am unable to test the model at this time due to leaning on tall prints; once I get a metal HBP surface in I'll run it myself!)\r

Edit:\r
 TAS TSU Robot Zip:These are the separated objects used for the model; made available because someone wants them for animation. :)""" ;
