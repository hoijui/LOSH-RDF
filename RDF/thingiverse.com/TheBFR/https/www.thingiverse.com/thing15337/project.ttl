    okh:function """This is a 3D printable stand for the Kindle Fire. It is a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4020 by eagleapex. The Kindle Fire is a little thicker than the iPad so I widened the gap where the tablet sits. This also works for the Xoom (original and family edition), may work for other tablets as well depending on the thickness. \r
\r
I added a second STL that has 2 on it. This will print on a TOM, but takes up almost the entire platform. I prefer to print one at a time for naow as I have some curling issues with prints that go all the way to the edge, but the curling does not affect the function.""" ;
