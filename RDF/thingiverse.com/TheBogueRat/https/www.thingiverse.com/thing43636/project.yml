function: "The QU-BD extruder didn't work for me.  I didn't have a 624 bearing for bdring's mod or the other MK8 minimalistic mods but I do have a laser cutter.\r\n\r\nI used this for a few weeks without problems until my Solidoodle arrived. Spent a week screwing around with the QU-BD stock and couldn't take it anymore.  This thing worked great and let me focus on printing, instead of the machine failures."
