function = "I didn't like the press-fit X rods (or drilled/tapped holes - not sure what was intended to secure them), so I added M3 trapped nuts to secure them.  Also added another trap for second 8mm nut.  Oh... and a couple spaces to reduce the amount of plastic.\r\n\r\n[UPDATE] V2 has trapped nuts (M3 again) instead of drill dimples for the nut cap.  I just tried drilling my first version and the lamination cracked (BOO wood screws!)."
