function = "SCAD included if you need to tweak to your dimensions.  I'm using ~1.5cm square towel bar for arms on my quad.\r\n\r\nMy build is light, and cheap.  I suppose I could be cohersed into including some more details about it if people are interested. \r\n\r\nI included a pic of my entire quadrotor, just for giggles.\r\n\r\nThese struts are not indestructable, I know from experience.  They break away easily, and take a brunt of the damage that would normally taken by your frame... no problem though - just print more."
