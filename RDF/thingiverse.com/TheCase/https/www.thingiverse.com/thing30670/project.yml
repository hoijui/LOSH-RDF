function: "TommyC's fine design, with a small change for accessibility.  I reversed the trapped nuts one side (so that they are inside rather than out... as requested by RustyPaint.  An excellent idea, I might add.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  new part, there were some shape errors that are now fixed.  Also added my modified SCAD libs that required tweaking to flip the holders."
