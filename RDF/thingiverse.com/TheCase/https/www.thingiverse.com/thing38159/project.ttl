    okh:function """droger's adaptation of andromeda's quadruped is awesome!  I was planning on making my own design months ago.  Life got in the way for a while, and BOOM, someone saved me a ton of time!  A heartfelt thank you for that :)  \r
\r
Small problem though - the original design didn't fit the cheap 9G micro servos that I had on hand.  \r
\r
So I spent a *smaller amount of time* optimizing the design to fit the servos I (and a lot of other people might) have in stock.  \r
\r
I zipped up the OpenSCAD versions of the parts in case you need to tweak them to fit your servos or printer tolerances.  \r
\r
NOTE:  what's shown in the picture are some mid-prototype parts.  The finals are actually nicer with rounded corners and whatnot.  Fancy!  \r
\r
UPDATE UPDATE: I cleaned up the OpenSCAD files in the zip package.  I know some of you have servos with slightly different dimensions.  The new scads should be parametric so that you can tweak  a few dimensions to get parts that will fit your servos!  \r
\r
UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: the parametrics now support different servo horn dimensions!  \r
\r
UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE:  I've included a beta version of the design intended for those that have the Tower Pro version of the blue servo, based on communicated measurements.  No guarantees: I do not have one of these servos to test the fit.  I do have some on order, but it could be a couple weeks before they arrive.  The beta STLs are available in the zipped archive named case_qp_tower_stls-beta.zip .""" ;
