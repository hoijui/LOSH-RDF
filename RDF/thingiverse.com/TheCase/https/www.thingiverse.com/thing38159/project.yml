function: "droger's adaptation of andromeda's quadruped is awesome!  I was planning on making my own design months ago.  Life got in the way for a while, and BOOM, someone saved me a ton of time!  A heartfelt thank you for that :)  \r\n\r\nSmall problem though - the original design didn't fit the cheap 9G micro servos that I had on hand.  \r\n\r\nSo I spent a *smaller amount of time* optimizing the design to fit the servos I (and a lot of other people might) have in stock.  \r\n\r\nI zipped up the OpenSCAD versions of the parts in case you need to tweak them to fit your servos or printer tolerances.  \r\n\r\nNOTE:  what's shown in the picture are some mid-prototype parts.  The finals are actually nicer with rounded corners and whatnot.  Fancy!  \r\n\r\nUPDATE UPDATE: I cleaned up the OpenSCAD files in the zip package.  I know some of you have servos with slightly different dimensions.  The new scads should be parametric so that you can tweak  a few dimensions to get parts that will fit your servos!  \r\n\r\nUPDATE UPDATE UPDATE: the parametrics now support different servo horn dimensions!  \r\n\r\nUPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE:  I've included a beta version of the design intended for those that have the Tower Pro version of the blue servo, based on communicated measurements.  No guarantees: I do not have one of these servos to test the fit.  I do have some on order, but it could be a couple weeks before they arrive.  The beta STLs are available in the zipped archive named case_qp_tower_stls-beta.zip ."
