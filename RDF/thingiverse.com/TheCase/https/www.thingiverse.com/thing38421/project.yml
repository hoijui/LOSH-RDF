function: "I started to design some slip-on \"hands\" to slide on the end of a set of disposable wooden chopsticks - to make it easier for chopstickers in training to get and hold on to food.  Even when using Zydac's wonderfully springy trainer accessory @ http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5923, its still hard for beginners to line up the tips for food grip.\r\n\r\nBut then I decided it was potentially wasteful to design a accessory for disposable chopsticks, even if the accessory itself was reusable. Solution: a full set of reusable, washable chopsticks!\r\n\r\nThey have a large grip area that should make for stable handling, as well as wide tips for solid food grabs.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:  I can personally vouch that PLA is not dishwasher safe.  It *will* melt and deform.  Hand wash only. I would avoid using ABS as a utensil material.   Here is a good discussion on 3D printing and food safety.  http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,164077,167669 . I advise you to read it and use your own judgement before use."
