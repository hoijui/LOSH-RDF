function: "I was excited for Michael521's spool holders, as I forgot to put in some t-slot nuts for an extruder... and didn't want to tear down the machine and recalibrate, just to add a top spool holder.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when the extruder moved about, it would knock the holders around and out of their place.  \r\n\r\nI added these (also minimal) stabilizers to hold the suckers in place."
