function = "Here's a way we can chat about our creations, Hold virtual events, engage in some online gaming, and other stuff.\r\nRight now, it's just a Windows client, and there's not much there to explore. But the chat works, and you can explore the virtual world a bit... If interest grows, I'll create a cross-platform version, a way to share/collect things, and add more places to explore...(and whatever else you guys want...) :)\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this and find it useful - I just started this yesterday, so it may take a little time till I add more fun stuff... (but I WILL!)\r\n\r\nI am hoping that posting this isn't breaking any rules, or causes any grief that's the last thing I want to do.\r\n\r\nBe well.\r\n-TDA"
