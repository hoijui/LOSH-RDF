function: My Dad is both visually impaired and a huge Yankees fan, so I build this model for him.  It's made to follow the raw shape of Yankee Stadium so he has a better idea of how the Stadium is laid out.  I've never been to Yankee stadium(the new one at least) so I used a mixture of Google/Bing maps aerial images to figure out the shape of the stadium.  Now that I've gotten my printer(ToM) calibrated a bit better I plan to revisit this to give it more detail.
