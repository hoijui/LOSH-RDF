function = "Another Nespresso coffee capsule holder utilizing the space behind the cabinet door! \r\n\r\nWe have too many capsules and boxes with no where to put them... oh the horror... \r\n\r\nThis little gem was sized to the inner width of my cabinet door. Luckily most of the door is recessed a bit so all I had to do was cut and glue the holder on the door. Now we have quick and easy access! Everyone in the house loves it."
