function = "My first thing! ;) This is a simple printable M8 washer. I searched for another version, but all that I found was thingiverse.com/part:176 which is only the mention of it as a part. I had none to add to my Thingiverse inventory (a Really cool feature by the way!) so I printed some out.\r\n\r\nThe stl files are for a single print or a fairly full plate of 9. EDIT: Now includes plate of 16 with .5mm spacing as per request. I have uploaded my originals as well as the _fixed files from cloud.netfabb.com/ just in case there is a difference.\r\n\r\nDimensions were derived from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washer_(hardware)(hardware) is part of the link but Thingiverse doesn't recognize it even if the link is hard coded...?\r\n\r\nI use Alibre Design, so I have also included the Alibre part and assembly files and an export for SolidWorks. I don't have SolidWorks to test the export, so hopefully it will work."
