function: This is a simple printable M5 washer. The stl files are for a single print, a plate of 12, 36 and a full plate of 64. I have uploaded my originals as well as the _fixed files from cloud.netfabb.com/ just in case there is a difference. Dimensions were derived from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washer_(hardware) )(hardware) is part of the link but Thingiverse doesn't recognize it even if the link is hard coded...?
