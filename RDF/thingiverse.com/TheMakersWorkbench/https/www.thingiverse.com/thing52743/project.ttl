    okh:function """I had issues with my mini tripod and LifeCam Studio when recording or streaming prints. So I designed a mount that held the camera at the popper height, and synced the printer's vibrations with the camera. The result was a much more steady video of the print and I did not have to worry about the webcam and tripod "walking" from the viberations\r
\r
I use a binder clip to hold my LifeCam Studio onto the mount but I left enough room that a 1/4" hole could be drilled for a  1/4"-20 bolt that will allow almost any camera with a tripod mounting hole to be affixed. \r
\r
I have also included the .skp file if anyone wants to modify this.""" ;
