function: "Lulzbot ships a handy and quite complete tool kit with their printers. Unfortunately they come stored in a zippered pouch that makes finding tools a bit of a hassle. \r\n\r\nI designed this desktop tool holder with specific slots for each of the most common used tools from the kit, plus space for a few more. \r\n\r\nI designed mine to be secured to the top of a wooden drawer box that I will custom build. \r\n\r\nI included the sketchup files in case anyone wanted to modify it."
