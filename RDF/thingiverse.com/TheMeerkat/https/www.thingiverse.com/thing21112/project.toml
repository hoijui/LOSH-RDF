function = "###Customisable conversion adaptor cowlings for fans of any size\r\n\r\nFiles you will find for this thing consist of STL files of some common conversions as well as custom jobs made on request, the beta OpenSCAD file for the Customizer, an older version of the native SOLIDWORKS file and a newer version of the native Inventor file.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSCAD file is primarily for customisation. As of now it is a very simple and inefficient model but should be able to make simple conversions that are not already available.\r\n\r\nThe Solidworks and Inventor files can be used for customising with very basic constraints that work for most sensible conversions. The layout of the file should be easy to follow for anyone with basic knowledge of the required software."
