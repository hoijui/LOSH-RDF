function = "A hollow ball with smaller balls inside. Created to test a printer's ability to print separate, non-interfering bodies.\r\n\r\nIt can also be used as a cat toy should you have a cat and should said cat be interested in chasing noisy plastic things around.\r\n\r\n**Note**: In order to print this successfully you will need a printer that prints support material or you will need to be very good with timing your print to add your own support at the right moments."
