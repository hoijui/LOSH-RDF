If you've got a larger hole in your wall these may help.\n\nSo here it is, my first model designed in OpenSCAD. I found something that would really benefit from being a parametrically designed model: Wall Plates. I've created a OpenSCAD model that allows you to pick from a list of 18 types of connector/outlet style which then generates a 3D model correctly oriented and modeled to be immediately 3D printed.\n\nSo what options did I include in this file? Well Iâ€™ve allowed the user to pick any width from 1 to 5 â€œplatesâ€x9d wide. These were measured off the standard electrical box sizes and should match screw holes in your existing boxes. The list of available plug and outlet styles is listed below:\n\n1. Blank Port\n2. Toggle Switch (Takes up entire plate)\n3. Duplex Outlet (Takes up entire plate)\n4. Rocker/Designer Plate (Takes up entire plate)\n5. Keystone Jack\n6. VGA Port\n7. HDMI Port\n8. DVI-I Port\n9. Displayport\n10. Cat5e/Cat6 Port\n11. USB-A Port\n12. USB-B Port\n13. Firewire IEEE 1394 Port\n14. DB-09 Port\n15. PS2 Port\n16. F-Type/Coaxial Port\n17. S-Video Port\n18. Stereo Headphone Jack\n\nWith the exception of #2-4 all of the plug types are modular and be placed on the top, bottom, or centered on a generated wall plate. All of the ports (excluding the outlets and keystone jacks) are designed to accommodate DataPro.netâ€™s panel-mount cables.\n\nI asked a Mathlete friend of mine if he could calculate the possible number of plug and plate combinations and well, the number is big, real big. He estimates that you can generate a total of 850,789,801,599 possible permutations. Making this possibly one the most customizable objects currently on Thingiverse. If you'd like to check his math here's some nerdy details: http://thenewhobbyist.com/wall_plates.txt\n\nAlso I've included more details and a few additional pictures in a blog post here: http://thenewhobbyist.com/2013/02/designing-with-parameters/\n\nChange Log:\n\nUpdate v1.1: Stopped by Home Depot and picked up some wall plates to make a few corrections (thanks 3dsteve). I corrected the screw locations on the \"toggle\", \"outlet\", and \"designer/rocker\" plates. If you've generated one of these you may want to re-generate it.\n\nUpdate v1.2: Added \"Long Toggle Switch\" for laird.\n\nUpdate v1.3: Added 3 plate sizes \"Standard\", \"Junior-Jumbo\", and \"Jumbo\". If you've got a larger hole in your wall these may help."
