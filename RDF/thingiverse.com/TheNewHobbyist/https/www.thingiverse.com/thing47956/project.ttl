Update v1.3: Added 3 plate sizes "Standard", "Junior-Jumbo", and "Jumbo". If you've got a larger hole in your wall these may help.

So here it is, my first model designed in OpenSCAD. I found something that would really benefit from being a parametrically designed model: Wall Plates. I've created a OpenSCAD model that allows you to pick from a list of 18 types of connector/outlet style which then generates a 3D model correctly oriented and modeled to be immediately 3D printed.

So what options did I include in this file? Well Iâ€™ve allowed the user to pick any width from 1 to 5 â€œplatesâ€ wide. These were measured off the standard electrical box sizes and should match screw holes in your existing boxes. The list of available plug and outlet styles is listed below:

1. Blank Port
2. Toggle Switch (Takes up entire plate)
3. Duplex Outlet (Takes up entire plate)
4. Rocker/Designer Plate (Takes up entire plate)
5. Keystone Jack
6. VGA Port
7. HDMI Port
8. DVI-I Port
9. Displayport
10. Cat5e/Cat6 Port
11. USB-A Port
12. USB-B Port
13. Firewire IEEE 1394 Port
14. DB-09 Port
15. PS2 Port
16. F-Type/Coaxial Port
17. S-Video Port
18. Stereo Headphone Jack

With the exception of #2-4 all of the plug types are modular and be placed on the top, bottom, or centered on a generated wall plate. All of the ports (excluding the outlets and keystone jacks) are designed to accommodate DataPro.netâ€™s panel-mount cables.

I asked a Mathlete friend of mine if he could calculate the possible number of plug and plate combinations and well, the number is big, real big. He estimates that you can generate a total of 850,789,801,599 possible permutations. Making this possibly one the most customizable objects currently on Thingiverse. If you'd like to check his math here's some nerdy details: http://thenewhobbyist.com/wall_plates.txt

Also I've included more details and a few additional pictures in a blog post here: http://thenewhobbyist.com/2013/02/designing-with-parameters/

Change Log:

Update v1.1: Stopped by Home Depot and picked up some wall plates to make a few corrections (thanks 3dsteve). I corrected the screw locations on the "toggle", "outlet", and "designer/rocker" plates. If you've generated one of these you may want to re-generate it.

Update v1.2: Added "Long Toggle Switch" for laird.

Update v1.3: Added 3 plate sizes "Standard", "Junior-Jumbo", and "Jumbo". If you've got a larger hole in your wall these may help.""" ;
