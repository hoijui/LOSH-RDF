function = "This is Communicator Badge as seen on Star Trek: The Next Generation. I designed it based on the official resin model. The new \"thick\" version is slightly redesigned to be more accurate to the real prop.  \n\nI find this to be an excellent calibration object because it is small, prints quickly, but has a unique shape that is tricky to print if the machine is not calibrated properly."
