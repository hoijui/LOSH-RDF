function: "Curiosity is the biggest, baddest, laser-wielding,  plutonium-powered, robot-rover ever sent to Mars. On Sunday, August 5, 2012 it survived a dangerous landing that secured Mars exploration hopes for a decade. It will help answer the question of whether or not we are alone in the universe. Why not print this fearless hero for your desk?\r\n\r\n(Excellent paint job and photo courtesy of Adam1mc.)\r\n\r\nUpdate 12/30/12: Fixed a lot of the parts in netfabb to better print on those picky printers. Leave a comment if you still have trouble.\r\n\r\nUpdate 10/8/12: Freely spinning wheels! Just break them off and drive away - no extra pegs! Working rocker to allow the wheels to go over big Martian bumps while keeping all wheels on the ground! Updated head/neck connection that fits better and has fewer pieces.\r\n\r\nUpdate 8/6/12: Updated body file that is much more accurate and detailed (with artistic license, of course).\r\n\r\nUpdate 8/5/12: Fixed head file where one part was not touching the build platform."
