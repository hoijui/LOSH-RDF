function: "For the latest, greatest version, be sure to check out the Eulidit Slant Wallet II (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1229532/).\r\n\r\nBased on the original Eulidit Wallet, the Eulidit Slant is reengineered for a whole new level of style and function. Still no bigger than a traditional wallet, the inside will feel roomy and organized.  \r\nTilt the Eulidit Slant Wallet forward in your hand, and cards will bring themselves to the front to easily grab and replace.  \r\nThe new starburst pattern on the bottom adds a unique design, reduces curling, saves plastic, and allows a finger to push through without losing any coins.  \r\nHold bills, more cards than ever before, and coins conveniently together under a sliding lid of your choosing, giving it a unique, personal touch. Standard-sized (U.S.) credit cards, bus passes, and photo ID may be used for the lid."
