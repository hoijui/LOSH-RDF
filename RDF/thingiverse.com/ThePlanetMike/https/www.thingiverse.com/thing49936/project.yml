function: "This fork holder is designed for people with limited mobility to create a customizable eating utensil. Using this fork holder and handle and some easily obtainable parts such as 1/2\" PVC pipe and a rubber band, this assistive device can be used to manipulate a fork while keeping your hands below table level. Unlike other overly complex assistive devices, it requires no screws or power. The handle is designed to support traditional and nontraditional gripping strategies.  \r\n\r\nI have used and relied on this design daily to eat independently since 2012. It's taken many redesigns to get it just right: to print without support, to be light-weight, and to print on small printers, but I am very satisfied with it. It looks more attractive than other designs I've used made by occupational therapists, and can be fully taken apart to be cleaned. Every fork I've tried has fit well, from plastic to heavy dinnerware. This design alone has made a 3-D printer a must-have device in my house!"
