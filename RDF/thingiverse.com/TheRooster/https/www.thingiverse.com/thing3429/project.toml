function = "You may be like me.  I have an above ground pool made by Intex.  Every year I go to set it up and every year something has broken or is missing from the previous year.  Well, this year I had a bunch of broken pool pins.  I didn't feel like ordering them and waiting a week for them to arrive via UPS or whatever.  Instead, I took a few measurements and modeled them up in my computer!\r\n\r\nI first tried making them in two halves and gluing them together.  That made my fingers sticky.  So I combined the two halves, chopped a bit more off the bottom, and Bingo!  Drop-in replacement pool pins.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed they fit in the pool.  I have not yet filled the pool with water though.  Hopefully they don't shear.  If they do, I will make them solid.  They are built in the correct orientation to resist shearing.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: They worked great all summer long!  No shearing problems at all."
