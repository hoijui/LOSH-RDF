function = "This is a part you can print to attach one of those cheap 2.99 Harbor Freight 9 LED flashlights to your bike handle bars.  It uses two zip ties, one to fix the part to the bars and one to fix the light to the part.  You might want to add a little rubber spacer between the bars and the part to keep it from spinning around."
