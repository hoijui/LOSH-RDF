function = "This is a character I extracted from the game Fallout: New Vegas. In a post apocalyptic world it's hard to tell who is a friend and who is a foe. Securitrons keep the peace on the New Vegas strip and \"help\" to guide you on your way... Or do they?   \n\n\n\nPrint out your own Securitron and be ready for the apocalypse!   \n\nSpeaking of the Apocyalypse... This doesn't apparently print anymore / on many units. I am working on a remix, but in the meantime, I wouldn't suggest printing it out unless you try to repair the model."
