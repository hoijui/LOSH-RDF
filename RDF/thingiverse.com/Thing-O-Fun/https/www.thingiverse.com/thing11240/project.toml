function = "Functional Pin Tumble lock.  All of the components can be printed with the exception of the helix compression springs.  These springs can be taken out of standard click pens.  The springs I made this for are 4mm OD and ~20mm long.  \r\nI made a small window in the \"Outer Barrel\" to view the key pin pushing up on the driver pin.\r\nThis was a quick project to familiarize myself with the design constraints required for successful FDM designs/prints.  I thought I would distribute since it could be fun for teaching and demonstrations."
