function: "Functional Pin Tumbler Padlock Model. User Print-To-3D: http://www.thingiverse.com/printto3d shared a very cool sectioned Paddle-Lock: http://js-kit.com/blob/sk9sIwQKzOFH1K4lciYmmQ.jpg that got me interested in making something that actually locks.\r\n\r\nAgain, all items are printable except for the springs which I removed from ball-point click pens (thankfully my wife is still putting up with disassembled pens around the house).  This one is a little more complicated but it still works and makes a good desk oddity.  If you were to glue the \"Top\", \"Retainer\", and \"Lid\" in place, the only way to get this lock open without the key would be to break it.  But, what is the fun if you can't take it apart?\r\n\r\nNote 1: I did do a bit of finish sanding on the components to make everything fit together and slide/twist well.  I would suggest a \"dry-fit\" of the components with their mates before attempting assembly.\r\nNote 2: The \"Lock\" component is a difficult print.  I was able to get good results by adding two supporting features over the length and then carving/sanding it back to a circular form.  If anyone has suggestions on how to print circular objects on their side, I'm all ears."
