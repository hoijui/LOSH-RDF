function = "A working model of a planetary gear set.  This model also allows the gear set to be exploded which gives a better view of the internals.  This is accomplished by pulling the ring and sun apart.  In its compressed or exploded form, the gear set is functional.\r\n\r\nThe ratios are as follows:\r\nSun to Carrier: 3.3:1\r\nCarrier to Ring: 0.70:1\r\nSun to Ring: -2.3:1\r\n\r\nhttp://auto.howstuffworks.com/automatic-transmission3.htm"
