function = "This is a print ready chain hoist capable of 30lbs or more (30lbs is all I had on hand to test with).  8x16x4 Ball Bearings, #10 Ball Chain and 3 different M3 screws are required to make this function.\r\n\r\nVideo: http://vimeo.com/42907056\r\n\r\nThe system has a 3 stage reduction.  They are as follows:\r\nDrive 2 to Drive 1: 27:9 or 3:1\r\nFinal Drive to Drive 3: 27:9 or 3:1\r\nDoubler Pulley: 2:1\r\nFor a total reduction of 18:1\r\n\r\nPurpose of this thing: I was bored and had a few bearings sitting around so I decided to see how much I could lift using plastic."
