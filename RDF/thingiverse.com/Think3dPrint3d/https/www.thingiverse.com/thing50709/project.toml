function = "The PaneIolu2 is a new version of the original Panelolu that uses an I2C port expander.  \n\nMore detail at http://blog.think3dprint3d.com/2013/02/panelolu2.html   \n\navailable here http://www.think3dprint3d.com/Electronics/Panelolu2  \n\nThe I2C port expander is used to drive the LCD screen and adds a piezo buzzer, and indication LEDs. This uses less pins making it compatible with the Mezli electronics and even leaves enough spare pins to drive a couple more outputs. Versions available for Printrboard, RAMPS, Melzi and Sanguinololu"
