function = "This is a name tag we designed for the printrbot. It has a spot for people to input their bot number, and has rounded corners, thanks to WarrantyVoider's round corners script (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8812). We also used avrgeek's font for the words (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6820). We think this is simple enough to be the first print.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I added holes for easy mounting, feel free to tell me if you need more/different places."
