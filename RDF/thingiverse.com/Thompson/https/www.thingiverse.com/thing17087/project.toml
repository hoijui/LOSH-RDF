function = "This is based on chapulina's printable Rubik's cube. I recently saw this cube and it gave me an idea:\r\nhttp://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b162/nostalgia75/cubing/guhong_pieces.jpg\r\n\r\nWhy not cut a cube piece in half in print it in color? so this is the result. If you have 6 colors of filament, you can print one print plate in each color, or you can use the filament colorizer and 5 colors of sharpies.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11742\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress, i have yet to add a way to align the pieces (such as a pin connector)."
