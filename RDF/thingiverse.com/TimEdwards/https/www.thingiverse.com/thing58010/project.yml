function: This is a mashup of Patrick Prosic's ActionCar STL (thing:249) as a shell to fit over a standard pinewood derby block.  The wheelbase is shorter than the standard cuts made on the block in the official pinewood derby kit, so one of the axle slots on the wood block will need to be re-cut.  Other than that, the wood block requires only a few straight saw cuts to fit the shell.  All dimensions are legal according to official pinewood derby rules.
