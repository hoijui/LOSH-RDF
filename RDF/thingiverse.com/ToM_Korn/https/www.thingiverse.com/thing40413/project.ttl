    okh:function """i found my old three wheeler some months ago on the attic of my grandpa. for sure it was dirty, the color came of and all wheels where damaged bad but at that moment i was sure - i will repair it for my little son (2.5 years old). \r
\r
so i cleaned and sandpapered all parts and made new paint on it but i also designed and printed new wheels for the scooter.\r
\r
one wheel consist of two printed parts each 120 mm in diameter and 15 mm in width. \r
glued together one complete wheel has a width of 30 mm and took me about 4.5h to print. \r
\r
2pcs. 22x8x7 mm inline skate ball bearings\r
\r
8mm rod and some nuts to lock them in place.\r
\r
have fun with it.\r
cheers\r
