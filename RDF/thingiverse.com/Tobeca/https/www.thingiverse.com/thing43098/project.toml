function = "Very compact, only 50x42x20mm !!\r\nOnly one simple piece to print for the whole extruder !!\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple extruder for NEMA17 motors. Designed for 3mm filament. I think a PTFE pipe to adapt 1.75mm is possible.\r\n\r\nYou just need a brass insert (Like Adrian Geared Extruder) and a 608ZZ bearing (+ screw and nut).\r\n\r\nNo springs, you have to adjust the pressure at the mounting of the motor."
