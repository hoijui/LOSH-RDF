function = "I installed twotimes excellent wobble adapter www.thingiverse.com/thing:2151 but had problems with the clamps on the guide not gripping the platform tightly. GregT's adaptation http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4361 clearly showed the solution but there were some issues with it (the guide was floating not fixed) and I didn't want to take apart my existing print - so I threw together a quick fix that works great and only took a few minutes to create and print even if its not beautiful."
