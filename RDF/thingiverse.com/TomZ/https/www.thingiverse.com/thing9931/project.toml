function = "The 4x4x6 cuboid was first built by Tony Fisher from a regular Rubik's 4x4x4 in 2004. Joshua Bell commissioned the design of an open source 4x4x6 design in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe design for this puzzle is really quite complex and the supplied STL files are probably only printable on high-end printers such as Shapeways' SLS printers. Nevertheless, I hope the SolidWorks file will still be useful to many for learning the art of puzzle design or making derived puzzles."
