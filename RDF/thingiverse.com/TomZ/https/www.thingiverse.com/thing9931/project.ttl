\r
The design for this puzzle is really quite complex and the supplied STL files are probably only printable on high-end printers such as Shapeways' SLS printers. Nevertheless, I hope the SolidWorks file will still be useful to many for learning the art of puzzle design or making derived puzzles.""" ;
