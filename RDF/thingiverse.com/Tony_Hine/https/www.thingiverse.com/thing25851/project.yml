function: "It is difficult to adjust the distance between the large gear and the small gear because you need to undo the three screws which hold the stepper motor in place. By the same token it is difficult to remove the stepper motor without disassembling the extruder mechanism.\r\n\r\nMy colleague KrasimirTsvetanov came up with this solution, he enlarged one of the holes in the gear by removing some of the material manually.\r\n\r\nI have now modified the STL file so that anyone can use this modded gear."
