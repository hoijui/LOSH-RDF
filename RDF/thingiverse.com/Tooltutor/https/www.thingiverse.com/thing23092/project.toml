function = "Like most of you out there, my workshop is my garage. I share it with cars, laundry and trash bins. Other than my new family, I share the home with extended family and their significant others. This can get tricky when there's always someone home and I'm trying to film. For those of you who do audio podcasts, screencasts or are aspiring youtube musicians, chances are you also share your work space with you home space.\r\n\r\nMy techy brain first decided I needed to install an \"on-air\" light on the other side of the door so I wouldn't be interrupted. Then my lazy new parent brain kicked in and decided a stick-it on the door would work. The compromise is this door hanger with a simple Do-not-Disturb message for all you podcasters."
