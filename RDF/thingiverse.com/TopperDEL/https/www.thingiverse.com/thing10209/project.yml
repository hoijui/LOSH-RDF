function: "DON'T PRINT THIS - at the moment. The rod-distance is wrong and too short. I need further investigation but don't have time to adjust the files at the moment.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI cleared the code and made it parametric. As I have a newer Makerbot TOM on my desk which uses different rod sizes than his design, I needed to adjust the file. I wanted to create a Mendel-Style-Y-Stage that can be adjusted to different bearings and rods.\r\n\r\nSo this is it. ;) You should be able to use quite every bearing (in a certain range) with quite every rod diameter (in a certain range). The design could be further improved to be more flexible, especially concerning the distance of the rods. This is why I leave the thing as a \"work in progress\". I did not have the time to test my design on my own printer, so maybe I come up with plenty of \"oh no, that won't work\" - so print it on your own risk! I don't know if it is working with the endstops, the belt and so on. I'll keep this thing updated when I get more information on this.\r\n\r\nBut I'm really interessted in your comments and remarks!\r\n\r\nSee thing:3697 for parts list.\r\n\r\nUpdate 21.07.2011: This thing is supposed to be used for a ToM of the latest design. It has different rod-sizes than the cupcake and maybe from older ToM-versions, too (I don't really know the history of the ToM)."
