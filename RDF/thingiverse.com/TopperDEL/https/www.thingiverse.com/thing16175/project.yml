function: "This is a tool to help out with the creation of an ice-cream-stick-lamp (see picture). The lamp ommits a really nice light and can be formed as you like it.\r\n\r\nHowever a native english speaker would call it - if you've got 5800 pieces of them you can make a great lamp out of it. Just drill two holes into each piece, connect them with a yarn and there you go. It's a bit of work, but the result is amazing. ;)"
