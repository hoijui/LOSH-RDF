UPDATE 10.07.2012: I've added the floor, which fits exactly into the mainpart and solves as a stand for the embedded LED-controller. I'll upload a picture of it as soon as possible (currently I'm printing the second house). I've also added a "Roof with dome", where both parts are combined and where the dome is hollow however.""" ;
