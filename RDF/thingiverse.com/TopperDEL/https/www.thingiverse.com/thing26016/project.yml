function: "This thing is a derivate from the great Sim City 200 Tabletop Play Set by Skimbal. It uses the capitol in a much larger scale filled with an RGB-Light, so the whole thing can be used as an ambient light.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 10.07.2012: I've added the floor, which fits exactly into the mainpart and solves as a stand for the embedded LED-controller. I'll upload a picture of it as soon as possible (currently I'm printing the second house). I've also added a \"Roof with dome\", where both parts are combined and where the dome is hollow however."
