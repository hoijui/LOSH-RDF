function = "This thing is a fully customizable kit to print plates and bricks for custom brick-images. The images consist of small bricks of different sizes that are placed on a grid. With this kit you are able to print all necessary parts by yourself. If you print the bricks in different Color you can create nice-looking multi-color images. The result is great for kids as it is fun to assemble pictures with it. You can even create image templates from your own Images by using websites like http://www.pictobrick.de/en/pictobrick.shtml.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this thing belongs to a company in germany called \"Ministeck\" (www.ministeck.de). \r\n\r\nSee what you can do with this here: http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Ministeck-still_life.JPG&filetimestamp=20081113201711\r\n\r\nThis Thing is still a Work in Progress as my Printer currently is down - so I can't check if everything prints like it should. But the parts are small - so you don't have much to loose trying it. ;)\r\n\r\nEDIT 17:42: There has been a little bug in the scad-file which lead to wrong stick-hole-correspondance. It should be corrected now."
