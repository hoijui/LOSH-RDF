Having the LG E900-Windows Phone 7 (I really like it, btw) - I needed a way to place it in my car (Kia Rio) to use it for navigation. I just plug it into the ventilation slots of my car, turn it 90 degrees and I'm fine.\r\n\r\nThis car-mount therefore is extremely usefull for me and fits perfect here, but may be useless for others. At least you may need to adjust it to your needs."
