function = "This is my first attempt to create a \"soap bubble box\". My girlfriend came up to that idea, but you may see this thing as an inspiration: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3449\r\n\r\nIt may need some updates, though. The hole where you put the wand might be too big, but can be filled with hot glue. I thought: better too big than too small. ;)\r\nThe cap fits too strong on the box. You may need to adjust the scad file or to sand down enough plastic. Otherwise you may distribute the water in it when trying to open it. ;) And do not try to \"sand\" it by turning the cap against the box in a quick manner - this produced a lot heat and melt both pieces together. That happened to me (stupid guy, I know. Should have known that heating-issue... ). ;)"
