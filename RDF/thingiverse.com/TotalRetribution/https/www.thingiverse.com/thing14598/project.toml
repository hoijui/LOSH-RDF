function = "This allows an AppleTV 2 to be mounted on the back of a TV using the 100mm VESA mount.\r\n\r\nI designed and printed it using 0.4mm @ 0.72mm but it should print at other printer settings. I also have included support for the recessed holes.\r\n\r\nYou may have to file/sand the protruding keys on the left and right parts to get them to fit in the slots of the base neatly."
