function = "These are miniature bases for tabletop war games. Diameters are 25mm, 40mm, and 60mm. The original set includes all versions with 4mm platform height + 1mm design height. Includes the radiation symbol and the biohazard symbol in all sizes, and a crude 25mm skull-and-crossbones \"bonus\" for your entertainment.   \n\nUPDATE 26 May 2013: Individual 25mm versions are 3.2mm platform height to match my other base designs.
