function: "Gaming terrain, made of seperate components so I can design alternate versions of each component as I see fit.  \n\nUpdate 1: New wall and cap files added, with file names ending in \"1a_6-column\" for a more open design.  \n\nUpdate 2: Added a new base_1a with a smaller center circle, and a fountain for it.  \n\nUpdate 3: Added pedestals to fit the center of base_1a. Two have round recesses for standard 25mm game miniature bases, and two are designed to fit Pocket-Tactics structures such as the \"Crystal Palace\" piece from thingiverse.com/thing:53543 or the \"Tower of Sorcery\" from thingiverse.com/thing:50096 designed by dutchmogul.  \n\nUpdate 4: Added alternate slender columns and cap option, and a bench seat option."
