function = "42\"/1.1m tall Jersey Barrier designed for approx. 28mm/1:64/S-gauge scales. Includes variants that can be linked together with toothpicks or wire for more permanant tabletop battlefields. The dimensions are slightly different from a perfect scale representation, because I don't like to work with strange dimensions that run to 4 or 5 decimal places."
