function = "25mm miniature bases with astrology glyphs for your magic-user RPG characters, alien soldier armies, or any other uses you may have for weird symbols. I included a prototype adapter ring to use these as 30mm bases for games that use that standard. Print the ring in another color for instant base contrast, or wow people with glow-in-the-dark accents.   \n\nThis includes the 12 signs of the Zodiac, plus the Sun, Moon, planets, and some planetoids. I know there are variants to some of these symbols. If you want a different version, let me know in the comments section below."
