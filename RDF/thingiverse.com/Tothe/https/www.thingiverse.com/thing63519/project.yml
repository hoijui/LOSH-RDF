function: "This is a set of pieces to build your own modular bridge or overpass. Ideal for war games or your kids' Matchbox cars. Pier height should be good for 3 stacked layers of 1-1/2\" foam insulation if that's your terrain construction material of choice.  \n\nWorks well with my Jersey Barriers: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:55070  \n\nApril 10, 2013: All old files have been updated and replaced. New files for complete set added.  \n\nApril 27, 2013: Slight changes to short beam & road end for better end-piece-only short bridge option. Added 3-column pier support as an alternative option. Removed \"Work in progress\" tag, but I'll probably keep adding new bits from time to time."
