function = "My friend and I were putting together a Prusa from Clonedel parts and had a lot of reliability problems with the couplings that link the z motors and threaded rod leadscrews.  We tried printing some of the couplings already uploaded, but the printer was not yet working well enough to make them.  These couplings have a very simple geometry that enabled them to be printed on our humble machine.  Probably not too efficient material-wise, but they definitely do the job."
