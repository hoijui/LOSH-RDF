The system has some interesting dynamics:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKU1z01YzcA\r\n\r\nThe OpenSCAD file is parametric, so you can experiment to change the flow parameters.  The default parameters make the flow somewhat slow, so you could try to make bigger chambers/channels if your printer bridging performance is good enough.  If someone knows of another safe immiscible fluid combination that is less viscous, I would be enjoy being told about it."
