function: Simulation of a Mobius strip with dowels glued into slots.  As there are no overhangs, you can probably eliminate the printed part entirely from the final object by gluing the dowels to each other as they sit in the slots.  If it doesn't seem enough like a strip to you, I would suggest making the backbone a bit thinner.  The first version was too flimsy for my liking and I may have overcompensated.
