function = "This is a parametric model for a Mobius Strip built with dowels glued into slots on a printed part.  You can set the number of sticks, their lengths, and diameters.  The constraint which determines the overall size is that the projections of the dowels towards the center of the circle do not interfere.  Cutting the dowels to length is the most labor-intensive part, so if you can find a bag of short dowels at the store you can plug in their length and build this fairly quickly (toothpicks?)."
