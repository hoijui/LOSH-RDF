    okh:function """Closed tube containing dyed water arranged into an interesting shape.  Before I built it I imagined it would look like four leaf clover, but once it was built my brother asked if it was a butterfly so I guess that's what it is.  It is very simple to build.  I imagine if you can drill holes reasonably accurately you could make the junction piece out of wood or foam.  The scad is parametric w/ respect to wall thickness and hole size.\r
