function = "It's a rainbow made with a printed holder, vinyl tubing, food coloring, and silicone sealant.  The OpenSCAD file is parametric so you can use different tubing diameters and the depth of the holes.  It will also spit out the theoretical lengths of tubing needed for each band.  The pictured printed part is big enough that I had curling with PLA, kinda motivating me to upgrade to heated bed."
