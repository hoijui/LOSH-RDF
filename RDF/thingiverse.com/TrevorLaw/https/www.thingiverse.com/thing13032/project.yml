function: "Well, one printed part anyway.  You still need to put in some tubing.  After having some trouble with the first peristaltic pump I tried, I did some Google-ing and came across this:\r\nhttp://microfluidics.stanford.edu/Publications/Micropumps_Cooling/Shkolnikov-selfpriming-rollerfree-minature-peristaltic-pump.pdf\r\n\r\nIt is basically a diaphragm pump with the check valves and diaphragm integrated into a single piece of plastic.  The best performing version so far can be viewed here:\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/fRKeDQPz7xw\r\n\r\nWith some more tweaking I'm sure it can be made better.  The nice thing about it is that it requires very little plastic, and is very compact.  In the paper they drive it with an eccentric cam.  Naturally I want to make some computer-controlled colored-water tubing thing with a bunch of these now.  Also, real 3d-printed squirt guns.\r\n\r\nUpdate: There is currently a problem with this pump that doesn't arise until a few days after assembly.  Presumably due to creep, the downstream valve slowly loses its ability to seal completely, resulting in greater backflow and then failure.  I will experiment but I may not be able to solve this problem without adding pieces (thinking of a set screw plunger sort of deal).\r\n\r\nVersion History:\r\n\r\nV2 (11/1/2011): Improved stroke volume and reduced backflow."
