function = "This a simple way to attach something to your extruded aluminium profiles. It comes handy if your extrusions ends are blocked for some reason and you cannot slide a T-Slot Nut inside.\r\nThis should work on most of the printing settings. You should adjust the printing settings if you expect a certain resistance for the claws.\r\nIt has 3 holes ready for M3 taps. The middle hole locks the claw on the extrusion, the outer holes can be used to attach your object to the claw and to the extrusion."
