function: "Here's a collection of cookie cutters I've designed with CookieCutter-Editor (http://www.local-guru.net/blog/pages/cookiecutter-editor). \r\n\r\nPrint, cut the dough and bake! Yummy :)\r\n\r\nThere's a nice write-up how to make your very own shapes with the tool I've used: http://www.instructables.com/id/Making-3d-printed-cookie-cutters-Dr-Who-Charact/\r\n\r\nOr simply press \"h\" for instruction.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to my flat mate Florian (http://www.thingiverse.com/flouSH) for letting me play with his Ultimaker ;)\r\n\r\nIf you want to follow our upcoming 3D-printing project feel free to subscribe to the newsletter at http://hypecask.com\r\n\r\nPS: \r\nI like the hand cookie cutter the most! So many opportunities to arrange the single fingers! Have a look at the pics;)\r\nPPS: \r\nNote that there are two versions of the Ultimaker Robot: The lite version and the normal version with more details."
