\r
At 165 metres tall, this elegant office building has become a work of art in tertiary architecture, a landmark for its design, technology and sustainability.\r
\r
Torre Iberdrola will have one of the highest possible classifications: the prestigious LEED CS 2.0 Certification, awarded by the USGBC which assesses and recognises projects using more environmentally-friendly practices, ones that are therefore healthier, more respectful of the environment and with more cost effective structures.\r
