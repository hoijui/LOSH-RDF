function: "Torre Iberdrola, designed by the prestigious Argentine architect C\xC3\xA9sar Pelli, is the latest great milestone in the process of transforming the city of Bilbao and the central feature of the new financial area.\r\n\r\nAt 165 metres tall, this elegant office building has become a work of art in tertiary architecture, a landmark for its design, technology and sustainability.\r\n\r\nTorre Iberdrola will have one of the highest possible classifications: the prestigious LEED CS 2.0 Certification, awarded by the USGBC which assesses and recognises projects using more environmentally-friendly practices, ones that are therefore healthier, more respectful of the environment and with more cost effective structures.\r\nhttp://www.torreiberdrola.es/index.php"
