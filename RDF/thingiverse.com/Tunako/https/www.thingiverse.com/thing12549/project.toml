function = "Mount for an 40mm cooling fan. Fits on an Orca v 0.2 with V9 Hotend.\r\n\r\nImproves print quality, especially when printing thin walled objects.\r\n\r\nThe mount is designed for a 40mm fan with 4mm holes and a hole spacing of 32mm.\r\n\r\nConsist of:\r\n- a fan mount, \r\n- a funnel to guide the air directly below the hotend nozzle \r\n- a fan grill to protect the fan\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout the funnel the fan will blow to much air against the hotend, so that it may fail to reach more than 205 Â°C, with the funnel it may still be necessary to raise the hotend temperature by 3-5Â°C. (I use 213Â°C for PLA).\r\n\r\nA higher heatbed voltage may also be necessary. (I use 19 V for PLA)\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely happy with the funnel geometry, comments/suggestions are appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFan grill created with \"Parametric fan grille\": http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11906 With parameters: \r\nhole_spacing = 32; hole_size = 4.5; outer_size = 40; corner_cut_radius = 27; outer_circle_diameter = 38.20; inner_circle_diameter = 15; outer_thickness = 3; inner_thickness = 2; vane_count = 8; vane_width = 0.5; ring_count = 3; ring_width = 0.5;"
