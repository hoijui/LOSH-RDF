function = "I changed the top corner so that two 624 bearing can be used, to minimize friction. \r\n\r\nUpdate: I've used this now for several prints and it isn't as useful as i thought. Without friction the spool swings to much which can cause the filament to become tangled. I don't recommend using this modification anymore."
