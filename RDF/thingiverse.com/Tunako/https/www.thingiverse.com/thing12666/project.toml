function = "The original design didn't work on all bottles. It slipped on some very tight caps. I just copy&pasted two together, one rotated by 30Â°. Now it has twice as much teeth.   \n\nUnfortunately it is also more difficult to put it on the bottle cap.  \n\nIf the original Plastic Cap Wrench slips on your bottle, you may have more success with this one."
