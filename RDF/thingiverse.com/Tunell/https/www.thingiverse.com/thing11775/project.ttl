    okh:function """Top-plate for the X Axis Stepper on the TOM.\r
I noticed that with all the Adjustments on the X axis tension, my wood began to warp and crack a bit around the channels. Especially around the T-Slot for the left side.\r
This plate should reinforce the wood making things sturdier.\r
Also a tensioner is integrated for making belt tension adjustments without disassembly.\r
\r
This design uses countersunk M3 bolts rather than the stock ones in order to allow a thicker ABS Plate. This will provide more strength with the same height.\r
\r
I liked it so much I put one on the Y axis too.\r
\r
I just noticed there is a similar design here on thingiverse:\r
