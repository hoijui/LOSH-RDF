function: "Top-plate for the X Axis Stepper on the TOM.\r\nI noticed that with all the Adjustments on the X axis tension, my wood began to warp and crack a bit around the channels. Especially around the T-Slot for the left side.\r\nThis plate should reinforce the wood making things sturdier.\r\nAlso a tensioner is integrated for making belt tension adjustments without disassembly.\r\n\r\nThis design uses countersunk M3 bolts rather than the stock ones in order to allow a thicker ABS Plate. This will provide more strength with the same height.\r\n\r\nI liked it so much I put one on the Y axis too.\r\n\r\nI just noticed there is a similar design here on thingiverse:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11502"
