function = "This thing is designed to move kibble through a standard PVC pipe. The cat food drops down from a storage hopper through a vertical T and is pushed laterally through a pipe into the food dish. Includes a laser fence to cut off the motor when the kibble reaches the top of the bowl. Another Fence to sense if the hopper is empty\r\n\r\nI created a couple of flanges to allow it to be mounted to plywood and a standard hobby servo motor. The servo should be modified for continuous rotation. A standard DC motor would also work, but I like that a servo is pre-geared for torque. Makes my life easier. I recommend HiTec MG series servos for better torque\r\n\r\nThis is an early print on my makerbot and you can see there is some edge curling, but I doubt my cat will complain. \r\nI have a replicator 2 now, but don't want to reprint just for aesthetics"
