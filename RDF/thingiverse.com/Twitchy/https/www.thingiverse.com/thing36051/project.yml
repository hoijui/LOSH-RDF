function: "Derived from this thing:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23239\r\n\r\nI reinforced a few sections and removed the hooks, instead replacing them with tabs at the bottom.  This allows the stand to be used on any flat surface.  The tabs slide nicely into a section of the dashboard of my vehicle, so it works well as a car dock also.  This should be compatible with most vehicles which have a similar flat portion on their dash.\r\n\r\nThe attached STL is the only source I have, as I did the modifications as a quick job in sketchup.  Sorry it's not parametric."
