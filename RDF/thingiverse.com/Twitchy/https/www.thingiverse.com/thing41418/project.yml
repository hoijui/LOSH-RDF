function: "Who says a 3d printer can't help your new years resolution of staying in shape?  Cyclists in cooler climates will often ride on stationary bike trainers in the winter to keep up their conditioning. This can get kind of boring.  A tablet could provide much needed entertainment if only there was a way to mount it.  This thing was designed to fit my Nexus 7 tablet, but should fit a great number of other devices as well.  It's mostly open on the side so that the ports (and most importantly to me, the headphone jack) are still accessible.  \r\n\r\nThis design works pretty well for me on a trainer.  I wouldn't recommend using it with rollers as it probably wouldn't be very stable on a moving bike.  Also, I shouldn't have to say this, but don't use this on a bike outdoors.  Your device will fall, and it may break."
