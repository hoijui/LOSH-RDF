Never a great fan of programming as a spectator sport, but I (and my friend's son) were still quite pleased with the results.\r\n\r\nThis coffin's been tidied up and improved since the demo but still could do with some work it probably could be a bit smaller and it'd be nice to add studs/suckets on the top and bottom (or base and lid), and it could do with holes for attaching things to it, but it's ok as is (and my first upload)"
