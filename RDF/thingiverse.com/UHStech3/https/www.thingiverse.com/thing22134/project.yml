function: "First attempt at this model. I have included the body file and back file so you can customise your own Landy or just print out the assembly file.\r\n\r\nNote. The tolerance on the hole in the wheel in not quite right. Run a 2mm drill through them before assembly.\r\n\r\nApologies to any Landy fans out there who may spot some inaccuracies, sure you will put them right on your own models."
