function = "This portable coat and purse hook follows the basic C-clamp mechanism to safely secure your purse and coat to any table up to 1.75in thick. Its small design (about 5in tall and 3.5in wide) means you can store it easily and take it with you wherever you go. The clamping mechanism makes sure the hook is secure to the table and canâ€™t be accidentally knocked off or easily stolen. Some more difficult assembly is required."
