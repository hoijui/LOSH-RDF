function = "Yet another x-axis endstop cable strain relief spacer.  I took a simple approach when designing this one.  There are overhangs but the printed ok on my Thing-O-Matic.\r\n\r\nSCAD file included so you can easily change it if you like.  Requires one small zip-tie to fix the cable to the spacer."
