Instead of using the servo based pen control this uses the Z-axis along with the spacer replacement pen holder I modified here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15788\r\n\r\nOr this one here: (or any number of other pen holders) http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16901\r\n\r\nI will create a revised pen holder that will eventually center the pen so the plot will be centered once again.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI take no credit for the original code was all done by Marty McGuire - see the original thing for all the details."
