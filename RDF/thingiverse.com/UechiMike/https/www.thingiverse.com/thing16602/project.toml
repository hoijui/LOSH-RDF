function = "This tool holder will mount in place on the Z platform in place of the extruder allowing you to cut shapes out of paper vinyl or other thin material without much effort.  It does require a very level bed and I recommend cutting on a cut down cutting mat.\r\n\r\nThis was designed to hold a leading brand craft cutter's blade holder. \r\n\r\nTurn you MakerBot into a \"ShopSmith\" type multi-tool!"
