function = "A pen holder for plotting on your ToM with minimal effort.  Mounts in place of the extruder and can be adjusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis can swivel a bit when it's mounted to get it centered nicely then.  It plots good for me but I'll likely be refining this slightly in the future - making it once piece and adding a little more bracing to eliminate some of the slight flex.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlot with G-code generated from Inkscape with:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16424"
