function = "I didn't want my lower firmament guide to stick out of the back of the machine so much so I threw together this quick one based on the dovetailed endcaps.  Printed Fine for me with the default Print-O-Matic settings on my T-O-M.\r\n\r\nThis should fit 3 and 1.75 mm filament - although I have not tested with 3 mm filament it's designed with a 5 mm \"tunnel\"\r\n\r\nAt some point I'll modify the other fragile ones on the machine."
