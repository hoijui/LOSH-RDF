function: "I decided I'd print a Protobot for fun but what good is a robot that can't see it's surroundings.  I found mkellner mount and modified it slightly so it would fit the on the Protobot's mounting point.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth this fits the 2010 REVB PING))) Module as well as the version originally reported.\r\n\r\n*** added scad *** The STL it uses is from the original PING))) Mount."
