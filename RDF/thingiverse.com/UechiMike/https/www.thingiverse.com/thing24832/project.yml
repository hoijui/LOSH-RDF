function: "This is a derivative of the apparently impossible cube puzzle.  While a Cube is cool a sphere is much cooler.  I take no credit for the original design from which this was derived.\r\n\r\nI didn't have to original model used so I grabbed the impossible cube STLs and unioned them with a sphere (as appropriate)."
