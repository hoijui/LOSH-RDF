function: My Bike-E recumbent doesn't have a conventional seat post to mount a rear tail light onto and I don't want to drill the extruded aluminum frame.  I made an adapter that slides into the frame that any standard seat-post accessory can mount onto.  This will allow me to add my state-mandated light or reflector.
