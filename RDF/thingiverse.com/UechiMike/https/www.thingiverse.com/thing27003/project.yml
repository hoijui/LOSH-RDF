function: "I could't find my 1/4\" NPT tap and I didn't want to spend a ton on brass fittings so I threw together this quick 1/2\" NPT to 1/4\" NPT adapter.  I did it in OpenScad using the great \"poor mans screw library\".  Took about 10 minutes to throw together and 30 minutes to print on my MakerBot (w/ Acceleration).\r\n\r\nBy request - I uploaded the .scad after adding a few comments to it.  You will also need to download the screw library that this is a derivative of.  Note that the threads in this library are not tapered so technically it's not NPT.  At some point I might modify it again to add tapered threads but for now it works fine with teflon tape."
