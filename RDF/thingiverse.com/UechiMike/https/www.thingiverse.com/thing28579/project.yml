function: "The original design was great but the size was a little too large for some tastes.\r\n\r\nThese were cleaned up in netfab, scaled 65% (x and y) and the hanger was adjusted back to the original size.  Based on the STL since I don't have solid works.\r\n\r\nThese printed fine on my ToM at this size with 100% fill and zero shells."
