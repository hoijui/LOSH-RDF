function: "I needed a tidy counterweight for my Drawbot.  I tried designing some different cantilevered pen holders with little success but did learn some stuff along the way.  First the basic pen holder works good with about 3 oz of weight hanging off it it for a sharpie.  Second,  as well as the ball bearings work- i'd rather use them for something else.\r\n\r\nI threw this together with the intention of filling it with sand - but like half the the stuff on the internet the weight per cc was off but 2x on the site I found it on.  Fortunately for me the design I came up with is also the perfect size for a stack of nickels."
