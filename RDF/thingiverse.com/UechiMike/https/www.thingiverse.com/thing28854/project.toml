function = "This is a 3-d printable version of a quick change pen gondola for the DrawBot.  It's capable of holding a fine point sharpie or slightly larger pen (like an expo dry erase - fine-point).\r\n\r\nFor a counter weight is uses 2 dead AA batteries (or what ever else you want to mount on it).\r\n\r\nThe servo arms are positioned to hold a Turnigy TG9e 9g servo.  As of right now I don't have one of these to test pen up/down functionality but it should work with an appropriately positioned servo arm.  For now I've added a couple washers to my servo arms where the weight contributed by the servo should be.\r\n\r\nI'll be posting up another one capable of holding a Sharpie Magnum (the really big sharpie)."
