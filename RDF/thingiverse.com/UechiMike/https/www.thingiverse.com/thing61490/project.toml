function = "My wife has a classic Fuji Club Fuji road bike but at this time of year in New England fenders help keep the water off the rider.  Unfortunately all the fender sets out there today are V-brake setups instead of the classic style and mounting directly to the caliper mount doesn't provide enough clearance for the fender.\r\n\r\nShe asked me to whip up these adapters so she could easily mount the fenders."
