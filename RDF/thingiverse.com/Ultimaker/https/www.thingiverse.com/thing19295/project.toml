The stretchlet concept was pioneered by Emmett (AFAIK): thingiverse.com/emmett\r\n\r\nMirko van Landschoot initially made this, but I ( http://thingiverse.com/Erik ) recreated it in OpenSCAD so I could completely control how much the text should be embossed, etc. The Ultimaker font file is generated by Paul Candler based on our logo."
