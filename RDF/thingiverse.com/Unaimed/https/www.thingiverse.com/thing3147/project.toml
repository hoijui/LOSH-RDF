function = "A parametric ball chain pulley for use with ball chain.\r\n\r\nBuilt in OpenSCAD. Has variables for changing the dimensions. Comes with 4 different fastening methods (selectable with variable). Grub screw with captive nut, hose clamp style (like http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:951), two flat spots (mendel standard) and one flat spot.\r\n\r\nBased on http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1322. Original intent was to fix that script because its conversions aren't correct (diameter/radious) but i ended up changing it totally.\r\n\r\nPrinter under construction therefore untested."
