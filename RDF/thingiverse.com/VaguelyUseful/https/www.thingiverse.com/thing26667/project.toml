function = "A new x-carriage for my Printrbot+. I wanted to have a little more room for a ducted fan (haven't figured it out yet) around the extruder, and the lasercut x-carriage was a little cramped. So... here's this one. \r\n\r\nUpdate: I've extended the deck enough to accept this part http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25473 and it fits just fine with slight modification to the cooling duct. Also, I've renamed this part to extruder mount as it is not the entire carriage."
