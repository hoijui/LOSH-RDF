function = "Archistrong's beautiful RAMPS 1.4 stack is just missing one thing - the Pololu stepper drivers.  I modeled up the A4988 board with heatsink and added it to the stack.  I only included the Solidworks 2013 files for the A4988, the rest of the Solidworks files are archistrong's.  The STEP and STL files are the complete stack with 5 A4988's."
