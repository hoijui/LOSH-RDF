This is Beta.  

Beta is a robot controled by Arduino and a L298N. The communication is via Bluetooth as you can see in the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrFWBjptyvQ&feature=g-upl  

It has 8 servos: 4 to move the legs, and the other 4 to move the wheels; and 4 motors. To power the robot I have used 4 LiPos I had in my house, they are connected in series so I had to use 3 7805 to regulate voltage.  

The servos I used for wheels are microservos, NO CONTINOUS ROTATION, imposible to control...  

And for the legs, I used a few I already had. This ones I recommend to be more powerful than others.  

The motors are geared and are this: http://dx.com/p/high-torque-80rpm-12v-dc-geared-motor-91628?item=6  

The Bluetooth module: http://dx.com/p/bluetooth-board-module-4-pin-121326?item=2  

And the L298N to control the dc motors: http://dx.com/p/l298n-stepper-motor-driver-controller-board-for-arduino-120542?item=4  

The code for Arduino is the file "Codigo.ino"  

I'm sorry for the lack of documentation I promise it will be more complete in the next version, Gamma Project.""" ;
