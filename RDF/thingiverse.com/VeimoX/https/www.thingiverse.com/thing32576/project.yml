function: "***NEW VERSION*** http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:254244  \n\nThis is Beta.  \n\nBeta is a robot controled by Arduino and a L298N. The communication is via Bluetooth as you can see in the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrFWBjptyvQ&feature=g-upl  \n\nIt has 8 servos: 4 to move the legs, and the other 4 to move the wheels; and 4 motors. To power the robot I have used 4 LiPos I had in my house, they are connected in series so I had to use 3 7805 to regulate voltage.  \n\nThe servos I used for wheels are microservos, NO CONTINOUS ROTATION, imposible to control...  \n\nAnd for the legs, I used a few I already had. This ones I recommend to be more powerful than others.  \n\nThe motors are geared and are this: http://dx.com/p/high-torque-80rpm-12v-dc-geared-motor-91628?item=6  \n\nThe Bluetooth module: http://dx.com/p/bluetooth-board-module-4-pin-121326?item=2  \n\nAnd the L298N to control the dc motors: http://dx.com/p/l298n-stepper-motor-driver-controller-board-for-arduino-120542?item=4  \n\nThe code for Arduino is the file \"Codigo.ino\"  \n\nI'm sorry for the lack of documentation I promise it will be more complete in the next version, Gamma Project."
