function = "Version 3 is an alternative to the TrinityLabs micro-extruder body.  This version has integrated bearing to appose idler tension. Use of the external bearing is no longer needed. The body is stronger and has M3 nut slots that don't penetrate the entire body.  Also, this body has a snap-in slot for a J-Head hot end which eliminates the aluminum slot plate.  The snap-in idea was derived from scottmayson.   This body is designed for the eMinebea PG35L-048-USC0 motor.\r\n\r\nMendelMax 1.5+ kits and printed parts are available for purchase at www.ultibots.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlibre PE source files included."
