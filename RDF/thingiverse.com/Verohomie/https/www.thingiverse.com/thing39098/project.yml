function: "Version 4 is designed for short shaft PG35L-048 motors (8mm).  This version has integrated bearing to appose idler tension. Use of the external bearing is no longer needed.  Also, this body has a snap-in slot for a J-Head hot end which eliminates the aluminum slot plate. The snap-in idea was derived from scottmayson. This Micro Extruder has been tested on MendelMax and Prusa.\r\n\r\nGo to www.ultibots.com for Hobbed Drive Gears and Bearings.  MendelMax 1.5+ kits and printed parts are available for purchase.\r\n\r\nAlibre PE source files included."
