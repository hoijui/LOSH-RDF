function: "Version 5 is designed for short and long  shaft PG35L-048 motors. This version has  2 integrated bearing to appose idler tension and minimize any shaft wobble.  Also, this body has a snap-in slot for a J-Head hot end which eliminates the aluminum slot plate.  This Micro Extruder has been tested on MendelMax and Prusa.  \n\nLatest design change moves the support bearings closer to the PG35L motor for more surface contact with the Drive Gear.  Use me_body_v5_3mm.stl.  We also added a Buddaschnozzle version.  \n\nVisit www.ultibots.com for Hobbed Drive Gears and Bearings. MendelMax Kits, Printed Parts, Filament, Electronics, and More are also available.  \n\nAlibre PE source files included."
