function = "Limits the range that this White-Rodgers thermostat temperature can be set to.\r\n\r\nMy wife, always cold, and my daughter, always hot, are at war...and I've been caught in the crossfire.  I'm always finding the temperature set to 60 or 90 depending on who had the most recent fit of pique.\r\n\r\nEnter my Replicator 2!  Here I've made a collar, which limits the range the temperature can be changed to from 73 to 78 degrees, without blocking the controls or airflow through the unit.\r\n\r\nYou too can finally have peace!  Just print this out and pop it onto your thermostat (if you have the same model), or make one of your own."
