function: "This is a trick dovetail joint.  When assembled it looks impossible, but it's trivially simple to open.\r\n\r\nI've searched online and found lots of other people have independently invented this mechanism, probably going back over a century.  Some designs have added latches and machinery, but some details are universal!"
