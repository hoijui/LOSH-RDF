function = "This is the shape of a rhombic dodecahedron divided into four identical pieces in an unintuitive way.  Luckily you don't need to be familiar with the final shape: when you discover how to fit the pieces together they will converge into a rhombic dodecahedron.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a YouTube video showing how the puzzle fits together: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpmkWj1LPwE  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's also described in my blog at http://mysd300.blogspot.com/2011/10/rhombic-dodecahedron-puzzle.html"
