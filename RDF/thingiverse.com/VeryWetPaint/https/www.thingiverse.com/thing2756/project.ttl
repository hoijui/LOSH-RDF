    okh:function """A quadrisection of a sphere into four identical parts with some novel attributes:\r
\r
1. The parts have no overhangs.\r
2. The flat \\'bottom\\' is completely concealed after assembly; there are no flat spots on the exterior of the sphere.\r
3. Exterior is made entirely of \\'sidewalls\\' where the resolution of FDM really shines.\r
\r
My test samples were built in transparent PVC on a Solido SD300 Pro, but my goal was to design a Makerbot-friendly shape.  Based on feedback from friends, I\\'ve adjusted the contours so the pieces \\'grab\\' onto each other after assembly.\r
