function = "This is a gift box of sorts, made of six identical parts that go together in a somewhat puzzling manner.  There are three styles, each held together by a combination of tabs and/or slots.\r\n\r\nBoxy #1 - Each part has two projecting tabs and two slots; the box is held together by arranging the parts so two tabs on each side lock into the slots of two adjacent sides while two other slides lock into this side's slots.  This version works requires material with a balance of flexibility and rigidity.\r\n\r\nBoxy #2 - Each part has to projecting tabs like #1 plus tabs that lock together in groups of three at the corners.  This version works best with fairly flexible material.  It's the most secure version, but also the most complicated.\r\n\r\nBoxy #3 - Each part has tabs that can lock pieces together at the corners.  This version works best with fairly rigid material, but needs sufficient flex to get the corners into place without breaking.  This is probably the simplest box to assemble.\r\n\r\n(Undoubtedly it could be adapted to laser cutting, but I haven't translated them.)\r\n\r\nMore pictures and description in my blog at http://mysd300.blogspot.com/2010/12/puzzle-box-gift-cube.html"
