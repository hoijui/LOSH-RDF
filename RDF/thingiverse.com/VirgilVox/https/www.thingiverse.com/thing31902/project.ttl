So I recently went to the Makerbot retail store in New York while I was there for Makerfaire. I picked up a Makerbot Watch. The design was just so awesome and simple, so I had to clone it! Note this isn't as well done as the original watch since I eyeballed everything. But it works nicely, just find an old quartz watch and pull out the guts. I've attached the sketchup file if you feel the need to modify. \r
