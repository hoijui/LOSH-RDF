function: "UPDATE: CONNECT.STL has a better clasp.\r\n\r\nSo I recently went to the Makerbot retail store in New York while I was there for Makerfaire. I picked up a Makerbot Watch. The design was just so awesome and simple, so I had to clone it! Note this isn't as well done as the original watch since I eyeballed everything. But it works nicely, just find an old quartz watch and pull out the guts. I've attached the sketchup file if you feel the need to modify. \r\n\r\nOpen source all the things!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: uploaded body2.stl. Print that body and faceplateap"
