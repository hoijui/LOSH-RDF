function = "Derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20015 \r\n\r\nThe Bareduino328 Plus brings you everything the Bareduino328 does with the added bonus of including what you need to regulate your power rail and keep your Bareduino's running smooth. Just one Bareduino328 Plus can be used to power several other Bareduinos or other five volt devices.\r\n\r\nThough the premise of the Bareduino is the use of the most minimal system to get the job done, not every project has a ready made five volt power source, and blasting your Bareduinos with anything else is likely to spell disaster.\r\n\r\nWe have added a guide to making a simple regulated power rail without increasing the Breadboard footprint.\r\n\r\nOther Bareduino Resources: https://www.virtuabotix.com/resources.php?product=bareduino\r\n\r\nWe hope that the guide will help you to regulate lots more than just your Bareduino!\r\n\r\nGuide: https://www.virtuabotix.com/feed/?p=628\r\n\r\nGet the Kit: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QGG1ZY\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Katherine and Luke for all your help with the guides!"
