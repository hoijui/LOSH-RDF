\r
First of all let me say that no force tests have been accomplished on this device for the purpose of climbing as of yet. And, even when I do publish the results of the stress tests, it will be entirely dependent on the quality of your machine, and materials as to whether or not they have the same performance. So use this for climbing applications at your own risk.""" ;
