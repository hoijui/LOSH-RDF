function: "This design is part of a project to build a children's climbing harness. But in and of itself can be used in countless different ways.  This is simply a prototype, and is not designed to be load bearing. Take it as a proof of concept. \r\n\r\nFirst of all let me say that no force tests have been accomplished on this device for the purpose of climbing as of yet. And, even when I do publish the results of the stress tests, it will be entirely dependent on the quality of your machine, and materials as to whether or not they have the same performance. So use this for climbing applications at your own risk."
