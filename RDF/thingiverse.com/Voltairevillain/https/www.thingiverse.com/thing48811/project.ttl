\r
The micro USB chord simply is pressed through small gates underneath the stand and can run to either side of your device.\r
\r
I haven't printed this one yet, but I made the tolerances pretty large so even if your printer is not the most accurate, it should still hold the nexus pretty well (I used roughly+- .007"; that would be a total tolerance of .014")""" ;
