function: "This is a stand that will cradle your nexus 7 either in landscape or portrait orientation.  However the charger can only be used when it is in Landscape mode.  \r\n\r\nThe micro USB chord simply is pressed through small gates underneath the stand and can run to either side of your device.\r\n\r\nI haven't printed this one yet, but I made the tolerances pretty large so even if your printer is not the most accurate, it should still hold the nexus pretty well (I used roughly+- .007\"; that would be a total tolerance of .014\")"
