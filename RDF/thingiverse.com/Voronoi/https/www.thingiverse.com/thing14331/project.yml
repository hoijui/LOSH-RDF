function: This is an ornamental piece made with a few Voronoi filters and some relooping and smoothing functions - all done in Meshlab (when it does CRASH on me). Im not sure if this will print in a Makerbot or like, because I don't have one. (YET) Give it a shot and tell me how it goes! If you think this would be impossible, check out Wild Stump ...which is a similar yet less complicated design.
