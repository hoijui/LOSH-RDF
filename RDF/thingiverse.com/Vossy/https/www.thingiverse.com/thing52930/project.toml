function = "This simple two piece handle incorporates an old hacksaw blade into the handle. It is a useful tool to remove your MakerBot  printed items. The teeth of the old blade need to be ground down to eliminate scratching the bed. This tool is catered for the MakerBot V2 machine, which uses the PLA material which ad-hears to the bed. The tool ultimately aids in the easy removal of all items built."
