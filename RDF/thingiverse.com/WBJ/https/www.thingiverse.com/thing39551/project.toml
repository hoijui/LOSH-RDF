function = "An experimental two-high spring dampened reversing roller cold end for a Bowden cable system. Uses modified Tetrix spur gears and axle hardware. Filament enters and exits on a 30 degree angle to assist in better hose curvature. Uses spring dampening system to allow deviations in the 3mm plastic filament diameter with an adjustable bottom out feature for decreased potential slippage. No bearings or moving plastic componentry."
