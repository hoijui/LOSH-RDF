function = "A couple of weeks ago my MakerBot went down. So in the interim as I awaited the replacement parts, I decided to rebuild the MakerBot. Only this time, I did it virtually. Utilizing available design DXF's and SolidWorks, I assembled a detailed virtual model.\r\n   This model can be used as a suitable reference in presentations or as an aid when assembling the real thing. I have uploaded an EDrawing file of the model. To view the file, you will require the EDrawing Viewer, which is a free download available here:\r\n\r\n http://www.qweas.com/downloads/graphic/viewers/downloads-edrawings-viewer.html\r\n\r\n   Through this viewer, you can interact with the model by panning, zooming and rotating to view the various aspects of the design.\r\n\r\nNote: Unfortunately, the circuit board decals do not show in the viewer."
