function = "Here is a simple design to allow easy attachment of the LED Strip v1.1 to the MakerBot.\r\n  I have uploaded two STL files of the design. One at the full length of the LED strip and the other at half the length. Either design will work. Also included is the SolidWorks part file.\r\n  One idea for customization of the design would be to add extruded text on the front and have it function as a nameplate for your MakerBot."
