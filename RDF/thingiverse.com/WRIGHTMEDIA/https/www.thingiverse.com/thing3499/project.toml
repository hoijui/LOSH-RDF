function = "Here is the six pack update for the Beer Pal (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3466). Thanks to Yocttar and Fido for their request. Besides allowing for six beer bottles, this update also provides a compartment in the handle for the Coin-op Bottle Opener by Starno (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3063).\r\nThe assembly comprises four parts. These are the holder, the handle, and the two extension guides. I've uploaded the zip file of the SolidWorks assembly, the STL files and the part G-codes. With the uploaded G-code on a MakerBot, the holder prints in approximately 2hrs 11mins, the handle in approximately 1hr 31mins and the guide in 30 mins.\r\n\r\nNote: The uploaded G-code has smaller diameter holes and drilling of the parts is required to accept the M3 bolts. Also, two holes are missing on the holder. This is not the case with the uploaded STL files."
