function: "This is a versatile clip for clipping and hanging sundry items. It is inspired by the really nice design from dmatsumoto (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3117)\r\nThe attached pictures highlight some of its uses. I would like to make reference to the \\\"Bag clip\\\" design by Erik (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2868) for a use for this clip.\r\nThe design was constructed in SolidWorks using only the 3-point arc command. I have attached this part file, along with the g-code, stl, and dxf files. The uploaded g-code file takes approximately 59 mins to build. Use the dxf to extrude the profile to a desired thickness in a program like OpenScad. It does not have to be as thick as I made it to serve its purpose."
