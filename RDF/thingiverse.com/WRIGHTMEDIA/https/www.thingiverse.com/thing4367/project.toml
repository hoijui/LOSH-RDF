function = "This is a \"clip on\" mount for the EC board, with an added option for a fan base to keep it cool.\r\nI developed this idea as a way to allow for a simple interchange between the extruder and the Unicorn pen plotter. No more bolting on and bolting off of the controller from one tool to the next.\r\nI have uploaded the stl files of the controller mount and the fan plate, along with the rar file of the SolidWorks assembly."
