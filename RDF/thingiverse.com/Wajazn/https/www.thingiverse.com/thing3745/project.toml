function = "Spring-loaded Rod Cover (rc) for Makerbot to keep smooth X rods from rattling and vibrating. I only printed one of these so far, and it SEEMS to reduce noise, but I'll update when I have the other 3 printed and installed.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I printed a second one and installed it. Rattling is not eliminated altogether, although it is quieter. I'll try just wrapping some thin tape on the smooth X rod ends to give them a snug fit in the holes in the plywood body."
