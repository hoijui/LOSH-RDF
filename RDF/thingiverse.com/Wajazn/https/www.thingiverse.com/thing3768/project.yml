function: I have an Evenflo baby gate in a doorway that is ever-so-slightly too narrow for it. The gate is hard to open and close, but otherwise works as intended. I designed a bracket that puts the gate slightly closer to the wall. Installed the part and the gate now opens and closes very easily (provided you use the top secret adults-only button press sequence). My 11 month old daughter has torture tested the new bracket with repeated abuse and it's held up fine.
