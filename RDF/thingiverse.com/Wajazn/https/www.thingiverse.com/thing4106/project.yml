function: Got a purty new Mk5 and relay board but don't know where/how to attach the relay board? This design makes use of two existing holes under the motherboard. I used T10x16mm screws since I had them lying around. Use wood screws, sheet metal screws, whatever. Put two screws through the holes from the inside of the Makerbot to mount the Standoff. Use four screws (or only two if you are feeling lucky) to attach the relay board to the Standoff.
