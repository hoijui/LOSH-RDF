function: "Latest in my line of baby gate accessories, apparently:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3768\r\n\r\nThe square steel tube of the Evenflo baby gate smack against a painted wooden cabinet. This thing snaps onto the square tubes solidly and provides a nice buffer to hopefully keep from damaging the cabinet.\r\n\r\nFYI, I designed and built a different version that snapped on and worked great, but it occurred to me it was a choking hazard if my daughter happened to pry it off. I redesigned the part using the \"can't fit in a toilet paper tube\" criteria, so it ends up being 40mm wide."
