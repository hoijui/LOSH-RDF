    okh:function "I have a pair of bookshelves from Target that have handy metal tabs to secure them to a wall to prevent tipping. The baseboard and quarter round keep the shelf about 60mm from the wall. I designed this bracket to fit the tabs snugly and allow one screw to go through the tabs into the bracket. Another screw goes through the other hole in the bracket into a drywall anchor (or stud, if you're lucky)." ;
