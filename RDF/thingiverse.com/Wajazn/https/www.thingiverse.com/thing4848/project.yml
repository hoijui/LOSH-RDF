function: I designed this back in October but never uploaded it to Thingiverse. It's amazing how similar http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4751 is so I uploaded this as a derivative. My cabinets are thin double-wall steel and I didn't want to drill any holes all the way through so this makes use of one of the existing latch handle screws.
