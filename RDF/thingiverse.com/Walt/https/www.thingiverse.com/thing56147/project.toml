function = "This is a 48 inch wingspan sailplane of my own design. All parts have been 3D printed using PLA. The wing has been test flown, but the entire assembled plane has not yet been tested. The wing uses the Eppler 214 airfoil.  \n\n               ****  Two files updated 18 May 2013  ****  \nThe two files are the Vert_stab and Fuselage_tail files. A very minor change was made to the vertical stabilizer by removing some material at the bottom of the control linkage channel. I've added a feature in the fuselage tail part to allow trapping the sheath end of the flexible control cables using two set-screws. This prevents having to cement the sheath in place to prevent movement."
