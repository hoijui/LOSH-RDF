function = "This is a parametrized pool nose pinch!\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tested them and they work absolutely fine. Can be a little hard to find the transparent ones in the pool and I don't know how long they will last, but you can always print some more :)\r\n\r\nThe scad file includes a 4x2 grid with different sizes nose clamps, so you can work out which one works best for you."
