function: "I made some modifications to the original Seej penny catapult.\r\n\r\n-the bottom of the arms was bumping into the table while loading the catapult, so I trimmed a bit of the arm below the bottom elastic bracket.\r\n\r\n-I added an extra slot for the winding key and elastic further to the front of the catapult. This makes arms angle slightly steeper, which results in a slightly higer trajectory.\r\n\r\n-Because i didnt have the right elastic, power was a bit low, to counter that I added some more elastic at the top of the catapult. To hold the elastic, I made an indent in the catapult arm and made the crossbar protrude a bit on both sides.\r\n\r\n-Lastly, in case you grow tired of shooting pennies, I added a 'medieval' catapult arm. Shooting peanuts or perhaps a game of angry birds ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11438 ) anyone?\r\n\r\nThe green catapult ha the original frame, with the modified penny arm.\r\nThe red canon is fully modified.\r\n\r\nThat stack of 'amunition' are actually 10x10x10 calibration cubes. They come in handy now :)"
