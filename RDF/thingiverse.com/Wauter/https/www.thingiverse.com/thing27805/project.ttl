    okh:function """This is a printable fine mesh screen, optimized for slicing with skeinforge.\r
\r
When trying to print a fine mesh pattern (2-3mm mesh size), I ran into issues. Skeinforge sliced the mesh into tiny squares - as it should i guess. Problem is, this takes ages to print, and the resulting object is far from ideal. Not as nice looking as it could have been and not that strong either. \r
\r
This mesh screen solves this by layering the perpendicular threads on top of each other. A tiny tiny gap between them ensures that skeinforge will detect them as 'lines' rather than 'squares. During the slicing process, this tiny gap is discarded and the result is a nice looking mesh pattern. \r
 \r
This design worked really well for me printing 1.2 mm mesh screens with 'lines' 2 mm apart and 0.45 mm wide.\r
\r
Im printing with a layer height of 0.3 mm and w over h ratio of 1.5.""" ;
