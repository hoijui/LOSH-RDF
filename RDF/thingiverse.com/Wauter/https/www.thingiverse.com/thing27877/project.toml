function = "This thing is part of an instructable on how to recycle spent desiccant dehumidifiers. (the kind with the hygroscopic calcium chloride salt inside)\r\nThey are frequently used around the tropics to keep moist out of cupboards and storage rooms, but quite a few makers use dehumidifiers as well to dry out filament before printing. If you are interested in recycling your spend calcium chloride desiccant dehumidifiers, check out the instructable too: \r\nhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Recycle-desiccant-dehumidifiers-Thirsty-hippos/\r\n\r\nThis dehumidifier is constructed out of breakfast oats containers with some printed parts. It's meant to be hung by the handle in a cupboard, to prevent it from ever topping over."
