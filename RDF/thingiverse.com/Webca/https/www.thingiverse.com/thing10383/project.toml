function = "This has been the ultimate project for me, and is now finally functional after 8 months of blood, sweat and ABS.  \n\nIt is also made on my 3d printed makerbot ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3285 )  \n\n\n\nThe printer can easily get taller by adding more z-elements and replacing z lead-screws and wobble arrester bars. I would then end up with almost 800mm build hight.  \n\n\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if this is the largest printed multi-piece object, as it is built from 15+ lbs of ABS plastic.  \n\n\n\nSpecs   \n\nFootprint: 800x560  \n\nBuild envelope: 500x300x200+  \n\nPlatform: Heated with 800W, custom ordered, silicone wire wound element.  \n\n        - Kapton sheet, custom ordered to fit platform (500x300)  \n\nMotors: NEMA 23  \n\nExtruder: MakerBot StepstruderÂ® MK6 Plus  \n\nElectronics: MakerBotÂ® Generation 4  \n\nInterface: PC/Mac or MakerBotÂ® Gen 4 Interface Board Kit v1.1  \n\nMotion: all axis uses linear bearings for smooth motion.  \n\n\n\nBuild duration: 8 months  \n\nPlastic used: 15+ lbs  \n\nPrice: 3000$ (approx.)  \n\n\n\nVideo of the printer in action: http://hacknorway.com/wordpress/?p=82"
