It is also made on my 3d printed makerbot ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3285 )  



The printer can easily get taller by adding more z-elements and replacing z lead-screws and wobble arrester bars. I would then end up with almost 800mm build hight.  



It wouldn't surprise me if this is the largest printed multi-piece object, as it is built from 15+ lbs of ABS plastic.
