function = "This is a spool-holder as promised in the title. The one i printed is made for carrying a spool with a diameter of 20 cm (or 8 inches for those who is not european).\r\n\r\nI got this spool from a regular hardware store and is the kind that usually contains electrical wire. Hardware stores just throw these away, so just ask the clerk for one and there is a big chance you will get one."
