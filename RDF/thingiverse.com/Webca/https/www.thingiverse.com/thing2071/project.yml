function: "You all know and love the additive method of 3d printing with the plastruder. And now you can try the subtractive method by using this dremel attachment that i have been thinking of making for a while now, and finally sat down yesterday and designed it.\r\n\r\nIt uses the same holes as the plastruder for mounting, and even the same screws\r\n\r\nIt is now printed, mounted and tested."
