\r
I was in the market for something like this myself, and was looking around searching for toolholders. The problem however is that there ar alot more different sized tools than there are toolholders that match, so then you end up with something that just looks awful and doesnt fit 100% to anything.\r
\r
So regarding this project the goal was to make many different shaped toolholders that could easily be customized to fit any tool.\r
\r
And again a big thanks to the makerbot crew for the plastic that made this:)\r

(Just an FYI - Everyone of my toolholders are printed on my full size makerbottable makerbot http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3285)""" ;
