function: "This is my way to add a fan to the Carriage of the Mendel90. The Hotend from hotends.com which work perfectly can use a fan for better printing. As the new MKV-B is shorter i had problems directing the flow correctly to the upper part of the PEEK, without adding much more parts to the carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment its made for the sturdy version of the Mendel90 of Nophead http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17826. 10mm smooth rods 60mm apart.\r\nIf needed i could make the other files accesseble and/or deliver one for the 8mm smooth rod version"
