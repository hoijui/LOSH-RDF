function: These are (now) THREE versions of the X motor bracket; Rhys Jones (with linear bearing mounts, called "X-motor-bracket for LM6UU with end stop and shaft clearance"), JM's updated version with stronger bearing mounts ("X motor mount beefier with end stop and shaft clearance"),  and my latest version with a much stronger Z adjustment ("X motor mount AC").  They all have a precision adjustable Z-stop integrated into them.  I have recently uploaded an idler for linear bearing without a fan mount.  Please see the triple bearing X-carriage at thing 14793 also!
