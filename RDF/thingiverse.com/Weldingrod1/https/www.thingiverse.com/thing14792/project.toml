function = "A blower mount for cooling your parts.  This travels with the X axis to keep it focussed on the print head.  FYI, don't leave it on all the time; it will cool off your extruder and heated bed significantly!\r\n\r\nThe models with the fan included are just so you can see what it looks like till I get it installed on my printer!  Sorry, but if you print the fan model it won't actually blow air ;-)"
