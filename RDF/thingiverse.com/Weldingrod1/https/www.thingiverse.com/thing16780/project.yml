function: "I'm working on a polar-polar 3d printer concept.  I thought that a tapered roller bearing turntable could be fully printed yet still be pretty precise, where linear printed axes are hard to get running smoothly.  Also, the printer would be able to print the entire bearing/table, rather than having to section it.  The file is sized for a 140x140mm table.\r\nIts noisy when lightly loaded, but very quiet with a 215 pound load ;-).  The photo was taken after the load test!\r\nSorry about the faceting on the race; Sketchup's follow me function is not all that impressive."
