function: "**March 21th, 2013** UPDATE\r\n\r\nI have had a couple days to experiment with the Kinect \"Reconstruct Me\" software, testing scannable area, optimal distance, etc. \r\n\r\nAs I suspected, a distance range from 2-5 feet is the only real \"scannable\" area. This sort of 3d modeling would be ideal for larger objects for the purpose of miniaturization. Kids toys shrunk down, etc. It does not pick up finer detail on smaller objects however. I had already been searching for an alternative to this with a regular webcam/camera. The one that seems most promising at present is the vi3Dim Reconstruction program. What's unfortunate about it is that it is all built from open-source software and should be offered to non-commericial license for free... It sells for $350!? No thanks... I will continue to look for ways around this obscene cost to a very BASIC program. (It is initialized and run through command prompt-lol). \r\n\r\nI will eventually seperate my files on here when I find a suitable program and system for using the turntable, with a different camera. The kinect base is still handy and when I get it completely measured I will be able to utilize that as a base and scanning handle as well.\r\n\r\nThat's all I have at the moment - keep checking back for more updates about my search for the best FREE or Economy-priced 3D Scanning/Modeling software.\r\n\r\nUntil next time.\r\nLive Long and The Force be with You,\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 19th, 2013\r\nVersion 2.0 Available\r\n\r\nI have simplified and smoothed the design quite a bit today... I also started *almost* from scratch in order to correct some mis-alignment issues... Everything on the table and arm should be a somewhat even number in my file. I changed my idea for the time being about the adjustable lift, instead thought a \"sweet spot\" should be found initially for MOST objects that fit in the table - seeing how much the KINECT can capture with its wide viewing angle. The table can be printed in just 3 pieces now and the ability to customize the type of stand you may like is now possible. The \"base plate\" that i eyeballed to fit the KINECT, is able to clip on to the tower i made and the tower has the slot to allow it to do this. The spot for the tower to fix to the base can be used for any number of things. After I fine tune this entire thing more, i may mock up a \"light fixture\" to be attached to another leg in case of the need for less shadows. Ideas for this keep springing up all over - even the thought of a USB-controlled motor for the turntable... Could be fun.\r\n\r\nUntil tomorrow - \r\nLive Long and The Force be with You,\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad.

I remembered seeing http://reconstructme.net/ with the free to use Kinect Scanning software, so i decided to use a planetary gear i found on here to make a \"lazy susan/turntable\" and adjustable mount for my kinect whenever my printrbot gets here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand all my alignments and tolerances are probably questionable, but I just wanted to hack out a rough idea of where i am going to take this. As i said this is my FIRST EVER from-scratch design in any CAD program so, please let me know some suggestions, or please tweak it and iron out the problems and if anyone is perhaps feeling ambitious... print it! I have all the pieces in a single file right now, as i haven't taken the time to see how i should break them apart... Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! \r\n\r\n*Some Notes*\r\nThe main table has tabs to slide into the cutouts in on the planetary gear.\r\nThe Gear center has a large cutout for it to fit on the secondary base (brown)\r\nThe primary base is for the kinect \"adjustable lift\" and is somewhat optional\r\nThis has a cutout for the secondary base to settle into for more stability.\r\nBut the side tower for the kinect slots into the primary base with the hex slot(s).\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad.
