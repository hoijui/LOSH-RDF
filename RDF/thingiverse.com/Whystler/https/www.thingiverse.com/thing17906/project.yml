function: "Meet the Queen of Teacup Dragons!  She knows everything there is to know about the british ritual of high tea.  However, she does tend to overindulge a little, as witnessed by her rotund appearance.\r\n\r\nThis piece was made particularly for the \"Pet Monster Contest\" sponsored by Makerbot and 3D Artist Magazine.  I really wanted to make something that could act like a real pet - hence the puppetry elements in this design.\r\n\r\nYou can turn her head, and make her mouth speak by using the rod below her body.  Check out this video to her in action:\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/-MZwydD6jIE\r\n\r\nIf any of my designs for the contest win, I plan on donating the prize makerbot to our local maker space called DIYode.  I have an UP! 3D printer, and I not only would like to have access to a makerbot per se, but also get others hooked on the wonderful world of 3d printing!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: A couple of pieces of this file have been updated.  There was a \"slicing issue\" that looked quite troubling because the bottom was slightly uneven (an artifact of boolean functions if yuh know what i mean).  The issue didn't affect the print, but it did make a certain stage of printing a bit strange for some folks.  The bottoms are now nice and even."
