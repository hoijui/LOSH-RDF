function: "These drive caddies are both expensive, and hard to find.  I don't have an original to go off of, so this is going to be a work in progress while I iterate.  Right now, I'm just trying to make sure it fits.  I'll add ribs once I figure out the best way to build in the supports.\r\n\r\nI'm going to try and accommodate both 2.5\" drives and Compact Flash Adapters."
