function = "The RBG Shield from Adafruit Industries is great, but it's not an easy design to enclose, due to the close proximity of the buttons, and the various feature heights.  I have tried to address the button problem as best I can think of right now.  I may add faces to the buttons that can be glued on after the faceplate is assembled.\r\n\r\nThe design allows both CNC Router, and 3D printing.  It's a tight fit, so be sure to calibrate before (or after) printing.  Even with calibration, you may need to sand the LCD window a bit, as that part is not always of uniform dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe buttons will need to be cleaned up for best results.\r\n\r\nIf you have any recommendations on how to improve this design for mounting, please let me know your thoughts in the comments."
