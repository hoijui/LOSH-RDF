function: The upper hole in the original hobbing thing would require support to print properly.  I modified the SCAD file to fix this.  I also adapted it to use 625 bearings, which are commonly found in NEMA17 steppers here in the US.  In the comments of the code, you can see where the change needs to be made if you want to use a different bearing size.
