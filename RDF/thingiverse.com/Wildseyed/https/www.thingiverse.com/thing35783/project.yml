function: "I am not a photo buff by any stretch, but I just bought a vintage Kodak Instamatic 404, and had been reading how the film format for these cameras was dicontinued in 2007.  People ask me all the time when I show them my 3D printers, \"What's it good for?\"\r\n\r\nNow I have an answer!  This project/Work-In-Progress aims to re-engineer the form factor of the 126 film cartridge, and provide the building blocks for creating an easily rechargeable film adapter, and other gizmos for these cameras."
