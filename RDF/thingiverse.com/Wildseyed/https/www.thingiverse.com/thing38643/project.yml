function: "My gift to you this Christmas season.  With so many cases out there, it only makes sense to add another if it brings a lot more to offer.\r\n\r\nHere is the short list:\r\n1.  Built-in clearances for putting the Pi in the oven.  No sanding, or cutting.  Just plop it in there.\r\n2.  No weak, spindly protrusions that will break off next time the wind blows.\r\n3.  Minimal use of plastic, but really strong.\r\n4.  GPIO clearance, so it fits really nice.  In fact, all** clearance issues that I have found in other designs has been addressed here.\r\n5.Mounting holes, for permanent installations.\r\n6.  Options for vents, and no vents.\r\n7.  Stackable, and upwardly expandable.\r\n8.  Less likely to warp during printing."
