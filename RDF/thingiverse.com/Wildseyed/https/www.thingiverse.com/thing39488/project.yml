function: I think at this point, most people use their hinged extruders without springs.  Improved consistency in the filament diameter from reputable vendors has made this possible.  Still, I wonder if there is anything to be gained from having springs.  The only choice around here is a variety pack at the hardware store, and only 4 out of 50 springs are even remotely suitable for use on the hinge, so here is one alternative.
