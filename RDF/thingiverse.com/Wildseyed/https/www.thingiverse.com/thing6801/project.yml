function: "I'm designing these couplings to replace the stock couplings that come with the RepRap Mendel Prusa.  The machine is not fully built yet, so I don't know how much flex these will have.  If anyone cares to try one out and comment, I would really appreciate the feedback.\r\n\r\nIn this rev I have rounded out the inside corners, in an attempt to make it easier to \"Build Up\" by extrusion."
