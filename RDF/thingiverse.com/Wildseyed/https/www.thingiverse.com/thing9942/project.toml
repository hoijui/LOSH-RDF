function = "This is an all-metal design for a RepRap frame that I came up with while on vacation in Puerto Rico.  Resources on the island are very limited, but I did find the local Home Depot around the corner, and there was a stash of tools, including a drill and hack saw, in one of the closets of the apartment we rented.\r\n\r\nJibaro is a word that refers to some of the island's rural inhabitants.  They tend to grow their own food, and raise chickens and hogs.  They are very resourceful, and creative.  Many of the craftsmen might be considered jibaros."
