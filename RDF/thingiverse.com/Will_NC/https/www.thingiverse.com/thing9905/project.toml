function = "An OpenSCAD file for creating variable sized sheets of interlocked rings in the European weave pattern.\r\n\r\nI've had this file for months waiting for my printer to get working/tune and have decided to go ahead and let people see it, and work with it - instead of continuing to wait.\r\n\r\nThis project was inspired by Bill20r3's conversation with me about chain-mail.  (HI! BILL!)  \r\n\r\n(V4 because this is the internal version number I was using for tracking things on my computer while I was writing this.)\r\n\r\nThis is not associated with any another 'chainmail' project already on thingiverse and was written/developed independently.  I've not looked at their code.  I do find that 'cupped/bent rings' are an elegant solution to a nasty problem for ring printing, but hate 'not round rings' as chainmail - the cloth flow is wrong."
