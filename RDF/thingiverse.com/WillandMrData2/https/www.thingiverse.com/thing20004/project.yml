function: "wheel barrow made in one print, saves power and assembly, human assembly obsolete.  \nAlso less overhangs when printed upside down so less chance of support structures needed.  \nWheel assembled onto axle during print, wheel on supports breaks free to turn as normal after print.  \nHas bits that are wider than handle bars to protect knuckles.   \nSmall print pictured, please post picture if you print life size thanks.   \nTwo stl files provided, wheelbarrow 9 is the new version.  \nDirivitive of the other wheelbarrow Created by  \ncatohagen"
