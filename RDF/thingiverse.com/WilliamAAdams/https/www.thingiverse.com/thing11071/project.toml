function = "In order to bake an apple pie...\r\n\r\nI really am doing geodesic domes, but there's a long road I have to walk in order to get there.\r\n\r\nThis thing is the next incarnation of the geodesic library.\r\n\r\nBeing able to calculate strut lengths is one thing, and definitely a required step along the way to constructing geodesic domes.  In fact, if you're just constructing them in the real world, the previous version of this library is enough, because you can calculate strut lengths and be on your merry way.  But, if you what you're after is the ability to actually model the things and print them out, then you need a little bit more capabilities.\r\n\r\nI found that I not only needed the list of vertices for a particular platonic solid, but I also needed edge lists.  That is, a list of vertices that form edges.  So, that's what's in this library.  Otherwise, no dramatic changes.\r\n\r\nI did add a polygon wireframe rendering module which takes the edge lists and renders a nice wireframe of the polyhedron in question.  You can specify the radius of the 'wires'.  I was toying with being able to render as flat faces as well, but that requires a lot more work than the simple approach I started out with (I am using my table saw to help me figure it out).\r\n\r\nSince it's .scad files, you can alter them to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nBased on several suggestions, I will likely stop using Thingiverse as my 'source repository', and put sources up on GitHub so they're more easily maintained.  Then I can just drop model turds here when there's something interesting generated from the core libraries."
