function: "After losing some hair over the issue, and with some help from Marius Kintel, I was finally enlightened as to why my dodecahedron was not coming out properly.\r\n\r\nThis thing represents some forms of the dodecahedron.  In particular, it is combinations of the dual forms (dodecahedron/icosahedron).  The .stl files are printed with a radius of 20mm, but you can change that to whatever you want either in the OpenScad, or by scaling.\r\n\r\nThe 'difference' form is probably the most interesting.  It makes for a fairly decent calibration piece.  It has some nicely sloping overhangs, bridges, and flat spots.  I makes for some good tuning between ABS and PLA as well.\r\n\r\nThe challenge with the dodecahedron had to do with OpenScad not being happy with the pentagons I was trying to print.  They had to be broken down into triangles, which Marius conveniently did for me."
