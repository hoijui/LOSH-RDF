I used their schematic to create the faces and edges.  I could improve the edge selection so that it looks better when you're rendering in wireframe mode, but that can be an easy revision some time.\r\n\r\nSo, what's neat about this easily pronounced polyhedron?  It's stackable!!  That means, if you put a bit of stickyness onto the faces, you can stack these together and fill a space.  Isn't that what Legos do?  Yah, like that, except it's a much more interesting shape than a rectangle."
