\r
After I posted that SuperShape stuff, user mattmoses pointed me at this site: http://www.steelpillow.com/polyhedra/five_sf/five.htm suggesting there are interesting space filling polehedra in the world that need to be turned into nicely printable models.\r
\r
This thing is the one that came first, and that I could easily pronounce.\r
\r
It's an interesting polyhedron in that it is self dual, meaning, it has 11 vertices, and 11 faces, so it can fit vertex to face, within itself, just like my favorite tetrahedron.\r
\r
Mostly what is in this thing is a translation of the cartesian coordinates from that web site.  I used their schematic to create the faces and edges.  I could improve the edge selection so that it looks better when you're rendering in wireframe mode, but that can be an easy revision some time.\r
\r
So, what's neat about this easily pronounced polyhedron?  It's stackable!!  That means, if you put a bit of stickyness onto the faces, you can stack these together and fill a space.  Isn't that what Legos do?  Yah, like that, except it's a much more interesting shape than a rectangle.""" ;
