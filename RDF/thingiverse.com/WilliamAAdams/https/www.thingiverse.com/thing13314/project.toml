function = "I was fiddling about with the SuperShape thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12770 and I 'discovered' this thing while playing around with various parameters.\r\n\r\nThis thing can be used as a scraper of some sort.  I'm thinking to print one and use it as a pastry scraper, or something else in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nI generated it using these parameters:\r\n\r\nRenderSuperShape(\r\n\t\tsupershape(1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1, 1),\r\n\t\tsupershape(5, 15.4425, -0.453763, 87.07, 1, 1),\r\n\t\t48,\r\n\t\t32))\r\n\r\nWith those sharp edges, it might be quite challenging to print.  I think it has a modern look to it, and it shows how kitchen items might be able to take on more of a flair, beyond the standard industrial looks.\r\n\r\nI did in fact use OpenScad to generate the .stl, but I actually used Lua to generate the .scad in the first place, and that's not particularly interesting as yet, so the .stl is really no different than the .scad.\r\n\r\nWith different scalings, it can become something else like a flipper, rudder, or what have you."
