    okh:function """I uploaded my first design to Thingiverse on November 20th 2010.  That first thing was a part from my "Klikko" play set: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4828\r
\r
Since then, I've produced roughly 130 'things', many of which were iterations on core design explorations.\r
\r
It's been fun.  I've learned a lot about OpenScad, 3D modeling in general, and fallen in love with rapid prototyping and manufacturing.\r
\r
I've taken all that I've learned to date, and created a new CAD program called Banate CAD.  You can read about it here: http://williamaadams.wordpress.com/hum-banate/\r
\r
As was once said about my Bezier work, I think I've 'rooted' CAD.  It's wide open, easily extensible, can create anything you can describe with algorithms.  It's almost as good as sliced bread.\r
\r
It's seriously just a work in progress, although you can use it to do lots of pretty visualizations.\r
\r
UPDATE: I have uploaded a copy of the program here as well.  I have received at least one report that it works on Linux (Fedora 15), so that bodes well, considering I've never run it there myself.\r
\r
The bowl_12.stl file here is of no consequence.  It's just there because I could not create a thing with just a picture.""" ;
