function: "One of the last extension libraries I wrote in OpenScad had to do with height maps. \r\n\r\nThis thing implements height maps in Banate CAD.\r\n\r\nYou can read the blog entry here:   http://williamaadams.wordpress.com/2011/11/25/and-height-maps-for-all/\r\n\r\nIt's fairly straight forward in Banate CAD to do a height map from any image.  It's actually the ImageSampler object that has the capability.  You can then add this to this other object called a RubberSheet, and away you go!\r\n\r\nYou can also specify a thickness, so it's not just a surface, it's actually a solid.\r\n\r\nThe image with the purplish background is the generated mesh loaded into MeshLab.  MeshLab was kind enough to remove the duplicate vertices for me.  I'll have to do that within Banate CAD itself some day."
