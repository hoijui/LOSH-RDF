function = "Not being very good with the UI 3D tools, but being good with the code... I wanted to create an interesting looking bowl, that had a height map as the texture of the surface.\r\n\r\nThis thing takes a procedural texture pattern (checkerboard) and uses that to create a height map, which is then used to displace the vertices of an ellipsoid.\r\n\r\nIt goes together rather nicely.  And, since you can make a height map out of any image, you can get some very interesting effects going on."
