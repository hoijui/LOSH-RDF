\r
This thing takes a procedural texture pattern (checkerboard) and uses that to create a height map, which is then used to displace the vertices of an ellipsoid.\r
\r
It goes together rather nicely.  And, since you can make a height map out of any image, you can get some very interesting effects going on.""" ;
