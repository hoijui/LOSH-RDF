http://williamaadams.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/banate-cad-second-release/\r
\r
I thought I'd make somethingto to go with it.  Well, while I was out in space taking pictures of the moon, and space ships, I thought, hay, why not turn the camera towards earth and take a couple of snaps, and create a model while I'm at it.\r
\r
This thing is a vector normal mapped (a new term I found on the internet) model of the earth.\r
\r
I grabbed a couple of high quality pictures from the internet, and just threw them into Banate CAD, the same way as I created the moon shot, and there you have it!\r
\r
I'm sure someone is dying to tell me the earth is an oblate spheroid, and that I can't model it strictly as a sphere, but I think at these sizes it won't really matter.""" ;
