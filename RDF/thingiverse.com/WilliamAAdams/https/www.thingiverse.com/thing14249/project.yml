function: "I was hungry, so I thought I'd model up some peanuts.\r\n\r\nThis thing is actually formed out of metaballs.  \r\n\r\nIt's just a blob, with a displacement map on the vertices, and the same texture as a color map on top of that.\r\n\r\nThe technique is similar to how the Earth Shot thing was created, but it uses the metaballs to calculate vertices.\r\n\r\nThe texture map file was downloaded from the internet, so it has a water mark.  You can make a 2-nut peanut, or a 3-nut, or whatever.  Just use more balls.  Choosing a better texture/height map will make it look better."
