function: "Well, \"Santa\" might be a bit of a stretch, but it is that time of the year.\r\n\r\nSince the latest version of Banate CAD has blob support: \r\nhttp://williamaadams.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/banate-cad-third-release/\r\n\r\nI can finally make nice blobular Christmas ornaments.\r\n\r\nThis thing is my attempt to make something vaguely humanoid.  My daughter suggested I just go for a snowman, for pragmatic reasons (I'm no artist), but I went for some arms and legs anyway.  I'm sure given enough typerwriters I could make it look really human in time."
