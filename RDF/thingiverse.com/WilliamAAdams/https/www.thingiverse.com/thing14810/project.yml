function: "Using the latest Banate CAD: http://williamaadams.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/banate-cad-lurches-towards-2011-finish-line/\r\n\r\nI took a snapshot out of one of the blobby animations I was doing.  I then pulled that .stl into OpenScad and created a little cup holder for my desk.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a convenient blobby cup holder.  Put some sticky rubber feet pads on the bottom, and it will make a nice addition to your desk."
