function: Yazzo is a system of interconnecting pieces that allow you to create Yazzums (a thing created with Yazzos).  The little pieces are called Yazzettes, and are the individual pieces, such as connectors, panels, and the like.  This thing is simply a few of the connectors.  The OpenScad file allows you to parameterize these connectors, and create any sizes you might want to play with.
