function: "Yazzo is a generalized system of interconnected pieces.  You might consider them to be like Legos, or Klikko, or similar builder sets.  What this thing does is help you integrate your electronics projects into the Yazzo build system.  Basically, take your board, whether it has mounting holes or not, and slide it into one of these harnesses.  Once in the harness, you can mount the harness to other parts of the Yazzo system using connectors such as these http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4834  What's particularly fun might be the Toy Panel http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4828\r\n\r\nUpdate: 22 Nov 2010\r\nUpdate design to include rounded edges, so it's printable without support material.  Also is more grippy on the board.\r\nAdded a few new harnesses, increased width on a few of them.\r\n\r\nMultiple Toy Panels, with harnessed electronics attached can be assembled into really neat things."
