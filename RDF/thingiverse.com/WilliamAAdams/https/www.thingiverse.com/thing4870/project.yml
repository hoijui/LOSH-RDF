function: "I need a way to quickly attach and detach my embedded electronics boards in various places.  the Yazzo Harness http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4841 is where I start.  I put my board into a harness, because dealing with mounting screws can be a pain.  Then I attach one of these button 'snap' connectors to the back of the harness using double sided sticky tape.  I could also use a Yazzo hole connector, but typically not in this case.\r\n\r\nThe, I stick the 'socket' onto some surface, like the outside of the MakerBot, and I can easily plug the board into the socket and have it attached to the machine.  Since it is a snap connector, like a button, yoiu can just snap it back out of there in a jiffy.  I like this because you don't have to spend time repeatedly screwing and unscrewing M3 screws in those holes, with standoffs and the like.  \r\n\r\nSo, there you have it.  A simple little connector system.  There is one benefit to the early stage of this design.  Since the socket only uses two prongs, instead of all four, the snap (attached to your thing) can move slightly in the track of the socket.  You can easily print a thing with all 4 prongs, by altering the .scad file, or you can wait for the next modification.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I will be adding a round snap button as well, which will give you rotational ability."
