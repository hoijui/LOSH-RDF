function = "Experimenting with different types of connectors, I would like to reduce the number of hardware fasteners required to build any one of a number of structures.  This thing is a OpenScad file which can form a number of connection and vertex pieces.  The connections and vertices are meant to receive a rod of a specified diameter (default 8mm).  It is parameterized such that you can change various settings such as ball size, connector length, rod diameter, connection angle, and the like.\r\n\r\nI am also going for an aesthetic. Basically, can hardware devices look artistically interesting while at the same time performing their function.\r\n\r\nFiles\r\nConnectors have pass throughs on straight lines, thus allowing the rod to pass through them.\r\n\r\nVertices have butted ends in their connecting tubes, which do not allow the rods to pass through.  Vertices are used as terminators on a structure.\r\n\r\nCube - Easily form cubes\r\nEquilateral - An equilateral face, with a connector off the side to form a prism.\r\nTetra - Form a tetrahedron\r\nTee - A connector that is a T section\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 30 Nov 2010\r\nThe Tetrahedron vertex is not quite right yet\r\nUPDATE: 30 Nov 2010\r\nNew rodconnectors.scad\r\nTetrahedron vertex actually works now\r\nUPDATE: 1 Dec 2010\r\nAdded Tetrahedron passthru connector.  Nice for creating shelves."
