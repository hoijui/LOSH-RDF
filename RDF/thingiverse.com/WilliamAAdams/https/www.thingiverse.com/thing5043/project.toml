function = "I have need for a swing arm that is mountable on the shaft of a motor.  This thing allows me to play with different mounting hole sizes, lengths, and thickness.  Doing the math and calculating the exact size, weight, etc for the specified motor torque would be easier, but less fun.\r\n\r\nIn general, since I model using OpenScad, I find it useful to include the .scad file so that others can play with it without me having to generate more models."
