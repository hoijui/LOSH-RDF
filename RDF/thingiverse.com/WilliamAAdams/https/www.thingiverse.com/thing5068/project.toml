function = "After forming a structure using various Yazzo vertices, I would like to be able to add various panels to the structure as well.  You can slide a few of these things onto rods and you have a convenient way to add shelving and panels.\r\n\r\nThis particular part is configured to slip over a 5/16\" rod, and will work with others.  \r\n\r\nThe structure is such that the panel overlays the rod that it is covering, so it should actually be able to bare some amount of weight without snapping, as long as the shelf is sitting atop the rod.  Even if it is below, it will likely be able to support some weight.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 08 12 2010\r\nAdded Shelf clip, so you can snap onto rod instead of slip on\r\nAdded .scad file so you can generate for your own size"
