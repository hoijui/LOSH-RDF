function = "I want to quickly and easily throw together different types of space frames.  Basically, I need adult sized tinker toys, with enough accessories that I can have structural support, can throw on some electronics, etc.\r\n\r\nThis set of things is designed for the construction of rectangular frames.  There is a vertex, a pass-thru, and a stackable.  There is also a shelf piece which will take 1/8\" shelving, whether acrylic or plywood, or whatever.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 18 Dec 2010\r\nAdded cubon.scad and connectcommon.scad so you can do your own designs.\r\n\r\nMy explorations are towards creating enclosures that do not utilize any fasteners.  So, friction fit is good.  Perhaps a dab of glue, a piece of tape.  If you really want to, you can drill a screw hold here and there for added stability.\r\n\r\nAs it is, the things require a little bit of support in the holes."
