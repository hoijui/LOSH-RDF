    okh:function """I want to quickly and easily throw together different types of space frames.  Basically, I need adult sized tinker toys, with enough accessories that I can have structural support, can throw on some electronics, etc.\r
\r
This set of things is designed for the construction of rectangular frames.  There is a vertex, a pass-thru, and a stackable.  There is also a shelf piece which will take 1/8" shelving, whether acrylic or plywood, or whatever.\r
\r
UPDATE: 18 Dec 2010\r
Added cubon.scad and connectcommon.scad so you can do your own designs.\r
\r
My explorations are towards creating enclosures that do not utilize any fasteners.  So, friction fit is good.  Perhaps a dab of glue, a piece of tape.  If you really want to, you can drill a screw hold here and there for added stability.\r
\r
As it is, the things require a little bit of support in the holes.""" ;
