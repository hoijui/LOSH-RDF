function = "When building things with dowels and rods, I often want to connect one thing to another in a loose and easily configurable way.  This thing is intended to go onto the end of a rod and give it a simple loop that can be connected to other things.\r\n\r\nIn the pictures here, I've connected a few on a \"double split loop\" (keyring).  Then I put a few of these \"vertices\" together to form a tetrahedron.  Using the same method, you could form any one of a number of structures.  If you use a more rigid connection point than the keyring, you might be able to make a structure that is more solid.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's just another thing in the Yazzo construction set."
