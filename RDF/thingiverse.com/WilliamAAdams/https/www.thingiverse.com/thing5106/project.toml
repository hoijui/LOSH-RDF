function = "Another one of the Yazzonic Sliponic parts.  This thing has the ability to grab onto another thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5101\r\n\r\nThis default part is designed to slip onto a 5/16\" rod.  There is a little wiggle room, so you can select the friction method of your own to secure it in the slot.  I use masking tape on the end of my rods to tighten up the fit."
