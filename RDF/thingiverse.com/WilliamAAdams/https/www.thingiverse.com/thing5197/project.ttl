    okh:function """The original thing this derives from was a bit hard to print.  Because of the placement of the integral balls, it required a lot of support material, no matter what the orientation.\r
\r
This thing prints the Yazzonic Disc Balls OnIt in separate pieces.  There is the basic disc, which now has little ball grabbing protrusions, and then there are the separate balls, which are specifically designed to slip over the disc, and be held in place by the protrusions.\r
\r
As you can see in the picture, having this particular structure gives you many options in terms of connecting to the other pieces of the Yazzo system.\r
\r
Also, this particular default design can take 1/2" wooden beads as well.  They fit snugly between the grabbing protrusions, so you have some options as to how you might want to use this thing.""" ;
