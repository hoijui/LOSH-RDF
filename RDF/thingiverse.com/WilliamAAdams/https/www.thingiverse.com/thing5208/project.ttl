    okh:function """I keep staring at my MakerBot Cupcake, wondering what transmorphical things I could do to it.  One of the projects I would like to do is reconstruct the box frame using a minimal amount of connectors, and still utilizing the existing panels.  This set of things are the clips necessary to put the box together using just these clips, with minimal screws.\r
\r
Also, since I do not have a laser cutter, it is difficult for me to replicate the interlocking designs that I often see on Thingiverse.  My hope is that with my simple tools, I'll be able to cut common plywood into rectangular shapes, and then use these clips to put them together, without requiring screws.\r
\r
Similarly, I'd like to experiment with acrylic, even glass, but I don't have the ability to come up with the right fasteners that won't crack those materials if I tighten too tight.\r
\r
Hay!  A MakerBot CupCake made with a glass frame!  Wouldn't that be special!\r
\r
Although these clips default to a 5mm size for the panels, you might have to alter it slightly to fit your particular panel type.  perhaps a millimeter greater or smaller.  You want a nice tight snug fit, so that you could just press everything tight, and that would be enough.\r
\r
If you're feeling adventurous, you could put a dab of glue on the wood before you slide it into the clip, and that would give you a stronger, no slip, and more permanent bond.""" ;
