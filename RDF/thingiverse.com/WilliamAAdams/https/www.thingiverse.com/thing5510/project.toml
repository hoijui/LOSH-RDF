function = "I have an increasing number of devices laying around my house.  Those devices increasingly have small screens that I want to look at.  I don't have enough hands to hold  the various devices at the right angle while I work on something else.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a generic device holder.  The modular design allows you to create simple clips that slide into a T-slot.  The wheeled base allows you to sit the device on a flat surface at any angle you like.\r\n\r\nIt is all modularized/parameterized OpenScad, so you can create any kinds of holders you like.  \r\n\r\nSome examples might be:\r\nA holder for an Arduino, including a battery pack.\r\nHolding onto your DSO nano\r\nReady tilt display for your iPhone\r\n\r\nThe sky's the limit\r\n\r\nI am making some refinements to the design for better structural integrity and modularity.  And of course some more interesting clips."
