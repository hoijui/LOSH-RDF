\r
This thing is a generic device holder.  The modular design allows you to create simple clips that slide into a T-slot.  The wheeled base allows you to sit the device on a flat surface at any angle you like.\r
\r
It is all modularized/parameterized OpenScad, so you can create any kinds of holders you like.  \r
\r
Some examples might be:\r
A holder for an Arduino, including a battery pack.\r
Holding onto your DSO nano\r
Ready tilt display for your iPhone\r
\r
The sky's the limit\r
\r
I am making some refinements to the design for better structural integrity and modularity.  And of course some more interesting clips.""" ;
