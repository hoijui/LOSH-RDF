    okh:function """I have needed to quickly form hinges, just from printed parts.  Additionally, I want to have a standardized hinge to allow me to use the hing in any design, and ensure it mates with other pieces. \r
\r
This thing is one piece of such a system.  In this case, the basic hinge is attached to the standard Yazzo UClip.  The default size is that of the MakerBot plywood.\r
\r
The design is such that the pieces will simply snap together and rotate around a dimple/indentation.  that's nice because it does not require a pin, or any other hardware.  Just the printed pieces.\r
\r
The easiest use you could put this to is to attach a couple of clips to the edge of a MakerBot window, then attach another couple of clips to a piece of acrylic, roughly the size of the window.  You get instant "doors" for your MakerBot.""" ;
