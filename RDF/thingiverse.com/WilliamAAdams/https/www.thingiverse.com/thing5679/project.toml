function = "As soon as I made this linear slide: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5625\r\n\r\nI wanted to make a modification.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of challenges with that first design.  First, the very large piece is very hard to print and get totally flat.  It wants to warp.  \r\n\r\nSecond, the design requires a fixed size separation of the two smooth rods.  That's going to be fine for certain loads and directions, and not for others.\r\n\r\nSo, this thing is a piece of a reinterpretation of that design.  This one piece simply captures a 608 bearing, and provides a nice stable piece that can be threaded onto a 5/16\" threaded rod.\r\n\r\nThis thing, in combination with a couple of these other things: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5678\r\n\r\nWould give you what you need to make a linear slide of any size (length and separation) for an endoskeletal bot."
