\r
I wanted to make a modification.\r
\r
There are a couple of challenges with that first design.  First, the very large piece is very hard to print and get totally flat.  It wants to warp.  \r
\r
Second, the design requires a fixed size separation of the two smooth rods.  That's going to be fine for certain loads and directions, and not for others.\r
\r
So, this thing is a piece of a reinterpretation of that design.  This one piece simply captures a 608 bearing, and provides a nice stable piece that can be threaded onto a 5/16" threaded rod.\r
\r
This thing, in combination with a couple of these other things: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5678\r
\r
Would give you what you need to make a linear slide of any size (length and separation) for an endoskeletal bot.""" ;
