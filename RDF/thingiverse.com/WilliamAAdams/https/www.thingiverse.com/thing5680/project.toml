function = "I've found it useful in terms of modularity, to be able to insert a capture nut in the place where a 608 ball bearing might be.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a very simple cylinder with a capture nut indent.  Otherwise, there is a thru hole the allow 5/16\" rod to pass all the way through.\r\n\r\nIt mates nicely with this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5679\r\n\r\nDepending on your printer, it could be a very tight fit.  I heat the receiver with a heat gun, and then press fit the captured nut bearing into the receiving hole."
