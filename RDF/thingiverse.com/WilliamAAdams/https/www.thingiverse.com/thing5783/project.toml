function = "I have need for a generalized cantilever arm.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a cantilever arm that has a 8mm gap.  It just so happens to fit the MakerBot plywood, so you could possibly use it on that.  My intention is to use it for something else.\r\n\r\nVarious sizes of things can be changed in the OpenScad file, so you can make it as large or small as you want, with any sized gap.\r\n\r\nThis particular one I printed with an offset on the top portion.  This is convenient for placing a flat piece, like a shelf on top of it.\r\n\r\nYou could add your own screw holes if you need to fasten it to something more securely."
