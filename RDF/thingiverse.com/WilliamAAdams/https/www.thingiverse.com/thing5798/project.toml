function = "This is the first design my daughter has made.  I said to here, \"How can you improve on that other design which has limitations?\", and she came up with this.\r\n\r\nA modification on the first version.  The first version of the Z-carriage had a couple of limitations.  One was the fact that there is a limit to how big you can print the thing.  If you're platform is only 100mm, then the maximum separation you could have had was 100mm.  \r\n\r\nThe other limitation is actually one of the interesting design points.  It created a teater totter between the sliding rods and the opposing lead screw using the mounting rod as the fulcrum.  Although interesting for easy balance and support, it limits the distance between the lead screw and the front face of the carriage.  Bottom line, it's a nice design, but we came up with a better way.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a carriage that is meant to ride along the z-axis.  It has capture nuts on the bottom, and in the middle, so that it will ride up and down with the turning of the lead screw.\r\n\r\nIt is printed in two identical pieces, which are flipped over and mated to each other with the central capture nut.\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty beefy assembly, which takes a good part of an hour to print on my Up! printer at 0.25mm, Loose, Normal.  It has to be beefy as it is the foundation of the cantilever clips: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5783\r\n\r\nAll combined, a couple of these pieces, plus the cantilever clips, and 3 nuts, makes for a very nice linear slide carriage.\r\n\r\nA further improvement would be to have some graphite infused bushings captured into the holes that slide along the smooth rods, but that's for another design.\r\n\r\nThe piece of paper in the photos is the actual design sketch my daughter used to flesh out the idea.  I thought it was kind of funny as we tried to draw in perspective."
