function = "Filament Deposited ABS is not the most strong/stable substance for structural building, so some support is needed here and there.\r\n\r\nThis thing provides some support between two threaded rods that comes together at a 90 degree angle.  As the piece has a funny shape, you can actually support all three planes of a corner if you can figure out how the pieces interlock.\r\n\r\nWith the OpenScad file, you can alter things like the block sizes, threaded rod size, and shelf size.\r\n\r\nIt's just a bit of fun puzzling how to come up with such a piece, even if it does not serve a practical purpose."
