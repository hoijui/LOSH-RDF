function = "Not a direct derivative, but similar to: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5551\r\n\r\nI have found there are many times when I want to connect one piece of something to another.  Having a generic trapezoidal key and slot system goes well for such applications.\r\n\r\nThis set of things provides a simple trapezoid based key/slot system.  The OpenScad file proves you the ability to specify the length of the span, and the thickness and width.  You can print male/male, male/female, female/female.\r\n\r\nAll the parameters are there for you to life the key/slot and use it in any of your designs.  If you do, you'll have the ability to attach things together, with or without spans between them.\r\n\r\nJust one more thing in a set of somewhat useful things."
