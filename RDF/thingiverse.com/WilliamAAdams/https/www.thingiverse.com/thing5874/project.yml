function: "I am exploring the creation of a delta bot and I need a triangle shaped thing as a base to hold onto tools. \r\n\r\nThis thing is a simple triangle base that can hold something.  It has notches in each of the sides which can mate up with the notches on something like these keyed spans: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5867\r\n\r\nAlthough the notch dimensions are different if you go with the defaults.\r\n\r\nNot that you need to fit that span in the notches, but you can stick the key/notch on any of your designs.  If you like epoxy, once you notch something in place, it's probably fairly permanent, and stronger than the rest of the plastic.  \r\n\r\nAlso of note, since there are three notches, and if you make the keys a snug fit, the first one will go in easily, as the plastic will flix to fill the open notch spaces.  The second one will be tighter, and the third will likely be downright hard to get in.  This is a good thing if you don't want to use any fasteners or glue as the notched objects will stick fairly well just by the binding friction.\r\n\r\nThe thing is parametric.  You can reconfigure the size by changing a single value which governs the length of the sides.  The default is a 3\" side, and 8mm thickness.  Since the notch is 12mm wide and 12/goldenratio deep, 3\" is about as small as you can go with that notch size, unless you decrease the size of the tool hole in the center as well.\r\n\r\nThere are M4 holes near each of the corners for your mounting pleasure.  Of course, you can always provide more holes.\r\n\r\nThe really interesting part comes as I think about the little attachments I can stick in those notches.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, if you're getting into OpenScad, but not too great at triangle math, there's a little bit of simple math in there, like finding the circle that fits within a triangle, finding the center of the triangle.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 29012011\r\nAdded truncated version of the platform, saves on plastic and gives 3 more flat surfaces.\r\nAdded OpenScad file, which is nice a clean and instructive"
