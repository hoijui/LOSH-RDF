function = "I have need for some common bar ends.\r\n\r\nThis thing forms a \"clevis joint\" I believe it is called.\r\n\r\nThe default size will allow you to slip an 8mm rod/dowel inside.  The hole for the pin will fit an M3, or 3mm plastic filament probably.  Good enough for prototyping.  Printing on its side would probably be best for structural strength."
