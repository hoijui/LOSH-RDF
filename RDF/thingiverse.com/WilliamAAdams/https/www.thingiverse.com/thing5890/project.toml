function = "The clevis: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5889\r\nneeds a mate.\r\n\r\nThis thing, combined with a female clevis, will form a joint.  Depending on what you attach the inserted bars to, very interesting degrees of freedom will ensue.\r\n\r\nThis thing has a M3 hole in the position where a matching clevis can be joined.  You can use an M3 bolt/nut combo, or make the hole any size you like and use more exotic fasteners.\r\n\r\nthe most ideal situation would be to put tiny little ball bearings in there, and a nice precision pin as a joiner.  But, using a simple 3mm piece of ABS filament will also do the trick and if you melt the end a bit, provide you with a quick fastener."
