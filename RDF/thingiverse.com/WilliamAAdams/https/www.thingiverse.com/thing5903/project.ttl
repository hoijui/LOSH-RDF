    okh:function """I need swivels that can quickly be attached to other things that have the matching notch in them.  \r
\r
This thing has a key that fits into a notch, like the notches on this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5874\r
\r
What would you do with it?  Attach this thing to something else.  Then put a 5/16" (M8) rod through the holes.  It can swivel freely, so you've just made an easy mounting axle.  Now attach interesting other things to the axle, and there you go!\r
\r
This thing has some mounting holes (M3) for those who like mounting holes.  Otherwise, a good friction fit will work for most uses.\r
\r
In the OpenScad file, you can change anything, from the size of the key to the size of the holes for the axle.  A good thing to do might be to increase the size of the axle holes, and put small bearings in there for a nice smooth ride.""" ;
