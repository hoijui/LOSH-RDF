\r
This thing is a "motor horn" like you see for hobby servos.  The primary design benefit is a key notch in one side which will allow you to attach something that has a matching key, like this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5867\r
\r
There is a 3mm hole for a set screw to come in from the side opposite of the notch.  I have not placed a space for a capture nut.  That can be for a derivative.\r
\r
In my own usage, I rely on the pressure fit, and perhaps I'll put some epoxy on the shaft if I get any slippage.\r
\r
It would work fairly well if you matched it up with a motor with a flat on the shaft like these: http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=34&products_id=324&zenid=e8c3272ee9d4329e34d4bd4348622ba0\r
\r
It is of course configurable.  You can select the disc size, the shaft radius, the thickness, the number of holes, whether you want two circles of mounting holes, what angle they're at, or no holes at all.\r
\r
There are two sample .stl files included here for quick printing.\r
\r
At any rate, just one more piece in the puzzle of the Tri Bot.""" ;
