function: "I have need to mount a motor in such a way that I can adjust its position perpendicular to its shaft axis.\r\n\r\nThis thing has slots in it that will take a M3 sized screw.  it also has a big M4 hole in the middle if you want to mount that way.\r\n\r\nThere's not much to it, and I forgot to save my other longer winded Description, so here it is."
