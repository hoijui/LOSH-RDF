\r
This thing is a notched sleeve that will fit a nema 17 motor snugly.  Of course there's an OpenScad file, so you can size it to whatever you want.\r
\r
It fits nicely with any 'keyed' item of the same size.  I am using it with this keyed shelf UClip: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5968\r
\r
It works out fairly well, and the friction fit can be enhanced by fasteners or glue if you really need that.\r
\r
I did just create another motor mount: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5940 but that's the more typical faceplate with screws, and screws to attach variety.  This one is all about not needing any fasteners.""" ;
