function: "I have need to mount a motor to a shelf without using any fasteners.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a notched sleeve that will fit a nema 17 motor snugly.  Of course there's an OpenScad file, so you can size it to whatever you want.\r\n\r\nIt fits nicely with any 'keyed' item of the same size.  I am using it with this keyed shelf UClip: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5968\r\n\r\nIt works out fairly well, and the friction fit can be enhanced by fasteners or glue if you really need that.\r\n\r\nI did just create another motor mount: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5940 but that's the more typical faceplate with screws, and screws to attach variety.  This one is all about not needing any fasteners."
