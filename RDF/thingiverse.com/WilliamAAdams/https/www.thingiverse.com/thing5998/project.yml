function: "After many little pieces, I am finally able to construct a delta robot that is mostly made of printed parts.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a delta robot frame.  There is the basic frame, mounted motors, arms, tool holder, and the like.  The arms closest to the motors are printed plastic notched spans.  The longer arms are wood dowels, with tape on their ends to enhance the friction fit into their fittings.  \r\n\r\nSteel rods in this case are 5/16\".  The size doesn't really matter, you can select any size as long as the vertices match.\r\n\r\nthe size is 2' on edge.  that's a pretty huge build area if you decided to use this robot as a 3D printer.\r\n\r\nIt's a good platform for experimenting with various delta robot ideas.  The arms will be replaced with carbon fiber.  The 'bearings' will be replaced with brash, with 1/4\" axles, the motors will be replaced with servos, etc.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, at least a model can be built, with not too many different types of materials.  There isn't a fastener on the whole thing.  Of course if it were actually moving, you'd probably find places where you'd want some fasteners, but that's the whole point of the experiment anyway.\r\n\r\nSome interesting aspects of the design:\r\nThis is an endoskeleton.  It can take a 'skin', but it's not required for structural support.\r\nThe tetrahedron is a fairly stable self supporting structure.\r\nNo threaded fasteners, other than the threaded rods themselves\r\nUse zip ties to hold the little motor board in place.  That board could be gotten rid of entirely if the motors mounted to the rod instead\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 05022011\r\nChanged male and female clevis part counts.  They were 24 ea, and they should have been 12.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 06022011\r\nCreated a page on RepRap as this is more of a development project than I think is appropriate for Thingiverse\r\nhttp://www.reprap.org/wiki/PolyBot\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 27022011\r\nThere have been many parts updates.  I've included a new picture with the servos and new arms, as well as the base plate in place.  I've added a video on YouTube of the thing in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzWJDWvJvqo"
