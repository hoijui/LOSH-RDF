function = "Not strictly a derivative, but serves a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nI need a thing that can hold onto a bushing on one side, and perpendicular to that, can hold onto a rod of a specified size.\r\n\r\nThe default sizes for this thing is 5/16\" on one side, and 11mm on the other.  The bushing I am using has an inner diameter of 1/4\", and outer diameter of 5/16\".  On the perpendicular, I'm inserting a carbon fiber rod that has an outer diameter of roughly 11mm.  That rod can be friction fit, or glued, or whatever, depending on what you're doing."
