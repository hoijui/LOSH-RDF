function = "The previous design was meant to allow for experimentation in placement and the like.\r\n\r\nThis thing improves on the original design by integrating the shelf clip into the motor holding rectangle itself.  The shelf clip is also shifted to be at the top of the side of the rectangle, rather than at the top.  This gives a little bit more stable support when the motor is spinning."
