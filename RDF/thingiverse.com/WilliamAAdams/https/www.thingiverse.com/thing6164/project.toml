function = "Some times I would like to attach a round rod directly to a motor shaft.\r\n\r\nThis thing will accept a shaft of a specified size in one end, and allow you to attach to a 5mm motor shaft on the flat part of the disc.  There is a M3 hole for a set screw to clamp on the motor shaft.  There is no boss (something solid to hold the screw in place), so you have to be gentle when tightening.\r\n\r\nThe default sizes are an 11mm \"arm\" and a 5mm motor shaft and M3 hole for the set screw."
