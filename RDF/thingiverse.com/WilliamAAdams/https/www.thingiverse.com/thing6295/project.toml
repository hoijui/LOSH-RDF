function = "Some times I need the ability to mount an axle at the end of a rod.\r\n\r\nSlip this thing onto the end of a rod and you can then put an axle through the separated holes.\r\n\r\nThis is a nice piece to help form a swivel joint between two different rods.\r\n\r\nThe default size fits a rod with an outer diameter (OD) of 11.34mm (some carbon fiber tubing).  The holes where an axle would go through can accept 1/4\".\r\n\r\nThese are easily configurable in the OpenScad file.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 11022011\r\nChanged the file slightly to have a better taper at the top."
