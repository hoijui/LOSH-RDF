\r
http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1203\r
\r
That part gives you a nice solid aluminum chunk with 4 machine screw holes on it.  Then I just had to figure out how to utilize that part to connect my carbon fiber tubes.\r
\r
This thing brings the universal mount together with the tube at a 90 degree angle to the shaft.  Very good when you're trying to use the motor as the muscle behind a swinging arm.\r
\r
Although this this is very similar to this other thing:\r

\r
It is not strictly a derivative, as it's design is completely different and the only thing they share is the ability to connect a tube to a motor shaft.""" ;
