function: "I have need to attach a bar or or tube, securely to the shaft of a motor.  I purchased these universal motor mounts from Pololu:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1203\r\n\r\nThat part gives you a nice solid aluminum chunk with 4 machine screw holes on it.  Then I just had to figure out how to utilize that part to connect my carbon fiber tubes.\r\n\r\nThis thing brings the universal mount together with the tube at a 90 degree angle to the shaft.  Very good when you're trying to use the motor as the muscle behind a swinging arm.\r\n\r\nAlthough this this is very similar to this other thing:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6164\r\n\r\nIt is not strictly a derivative, as it's design is completely different and the only thing they share is the ability to connect a tube to a motor shaft."
