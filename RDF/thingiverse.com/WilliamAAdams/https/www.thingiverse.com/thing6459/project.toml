function = "Although you can make an arm of any length to mount to a motor shaft using these two things:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6452\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6354\r\n\r\nand some suitable rod/tube stock, sometimes I just want a quick and easy arm of a given length that is totally printable.\r\n\r\nThis thing is kind of a mash up of the other two things.  On the one end, you can mount it to your 5mm motor shaft (the shoulder).  On the other, it has a ball bearing to form a 1DOF joint (the elbow).  Between the two is a printed cylinder that forms the 'bone' of the arm.\r\n\r\nYou can see in the picture how to use the thing, or at least one usage of it.\r\n\r\nOf course it's all parameterized, so you can create whatever size you like, limited by the capabilities of your printer.  The default size has a distance of 100mm on centers, fits a motor shaft of 5mm, and accomodates a 608 bearing."
