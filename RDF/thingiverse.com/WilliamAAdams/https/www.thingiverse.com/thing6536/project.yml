function: "I need to be able to mount a motor facing forward on a shelf that is 6.5mm thick.\r\n\r\nThis thing will hold a Nema 17 motor snugly.  It has screw holes which will allow you to securely fasten the motor in place, if the snug fit is not snug enough to deal with the torque in your situation.\r\n\r\nYou can change any of the parameters from the size of the mounting screws, to the thickness of the shelf it will be sliding onto.\r\n\r\nThe design could probably benefit from some mounting holes on the shelf clip itself.  That would be fairly easy to add to the design, or you could just drill them.  For my purposes, I will actually glue the clip to the shelf for a permanent fixture."
