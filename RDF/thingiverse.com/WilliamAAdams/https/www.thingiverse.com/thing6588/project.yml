function: "Sometimes I want to replace a wall plate in my house.  It might be a light switch, or a socket cover, but I want to customize it, perhaps add something to it.\r\n\r\nThis thing is the first of designs that help me in the home.\r\n\r\nIt is rather large, and if you're using ABS, it will give you quite a hard time with warping at the edges.\r\n\r\nThis is a first for me in that I have not actually been able to successfully print one yet.  The first attempt curled bad enough that the nozzle ended up dislodging it from the platform and sent it to the floor.  The second attempt was a bit better, but I could tell it was not going to come out well, so I stopped it.\r\n\r\nSince I can not print in PLA as yet, I thought I'd release the design anyway.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone can come up with a derivative that doesn't have such a hard time printing.  It's quite challenging given the amount of flat surface area.\r\n\r\nAlthough it does have a curved surface like what you'd see with a typical wall plate, it is not \"hollow\", meaning, it's a solid block of plastic.  A better design would scoop out the bottom.  I've been trying to do that in OpenScad, and it keeps crashing.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it's another thing to play with.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 21022011\r\nI did manage to print one out by standing it on its edge.  Still got some warping, but it's actually usable.\r\n\r\nJust discovered the prior art: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3342\r\nSimilar outcome, derived independently.  The other thing is more complete as it has the hollow in the back."
