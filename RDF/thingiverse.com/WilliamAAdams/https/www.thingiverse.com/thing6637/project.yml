function: "As part of my home renovations, I need more electrical outlet cover plates.\r\n\r\nThis thing covers nema 5-15 plugs.  These are the standard \"Duplex\" electrical outlets found in most home in the US.\r\n\r\nThe OpenScad has code to print up as many 'gangs' as you want.  One Gang == one set of two plugs.  A \"Two Gang\" would have a total of 4 plugs, \"Three Gang\" would have a total of 6 plugs, etc.\r\n\r\nThis thing is not a strict derivative of, but similar to:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3342\r\n\r\nIt is also not a strict derivative, but additive to this thing:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6588\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nSpacing on the outlet sockets was slightly off"
