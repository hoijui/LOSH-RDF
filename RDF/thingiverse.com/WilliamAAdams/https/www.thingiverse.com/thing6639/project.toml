function = "This thing is a cover plate combination.  It has one toggle switch open, and a Duplex electrical plug opening.\r\n\r\nIt is basically a mashup of these two things:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6588\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6637\r\n\r\nAlthough not strictly a derivative, it is very similar to things that can be generated from this thing:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3342\r\n\r\nIn general, you can use the OpenScad to configure just about any combination of sockets and switches to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nSpacing on the outlet sockets was slightly off"
