\r
This thing is a cover plate for a Standard GFCI outlet.  The size of the opening is such that it can be the basis for other types of cover plates as well.\r
\r
I don't have any multi-gang GFCI sockets in my home, so I'm not quite sure of the spacing, so I've only confirmed that it will work with a single GFCI socket, although the code is there for more.""" ;
