function: "As part of home improvement, I need cover plates for GFCI sockets.  Those are those sockets typically found in bathrooms, kitchens, and other areas where you want to protect people with wet hands and whatnot.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a cover plate for a Standard GFCI outlet.  The size of the opening is such that it can be the basis for other types of cover plates as well.\r\n\r\nI don't have any multi-gang GFCI sockets in my home, so I'm not quite sure of the spacing, so I've only confirmed that it will work with a single GFCI socket, although the code is there for more."
