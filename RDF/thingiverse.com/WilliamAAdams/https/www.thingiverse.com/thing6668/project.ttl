\r
This thing will allow you to put a servo into a snugly fitting sleeve, and then slide that sleeve onto a shelf.\r
\r
The OpenScad will let you play with the sizes, including an offset which is used to specify the height of the mount (0 would be flush with the shelf).\r
\r
I took my measurements from this servo from AdaFruit: http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=34&products_id=155\r
\r
I think it's a fairly standard size.\r
\r
Note that you typically have to remove the top or bottom from the servo to fit it into the mount.  Taking off the top is easiest.""" ;
