function: "I have need to mount a servo onto a shelf facing sideways.\r\n\r\nThis thing will allow you to put a servo into a snugly fitting sleeve, and then slide that sleeve onto a shelf.\r\n\r\nThe OpenScad will let you play with the sizes, including an offset which is used to specify the height of the mount (0 would be flush with the shelf).\r\n\r\nI took my measurements from this servo from AdaFruit: http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=34&products_id=155\r\n\r\nI think it's a fairly standard size.\r\n\r\nNote that you typically have to remove the top or bottom from the servo to fit it into the mount.  Taking off the top is easiest."
