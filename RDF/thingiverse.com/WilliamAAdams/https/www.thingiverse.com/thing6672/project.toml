function = "Similar to the last one, but I also need to mount servos facing forward to a shelf.\r\n\r\nThis thing allows you to mount a server with its plane of rotation in parallel with a shelf that it is sitting on securely.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the shelf clip is long enough that you could use glue to attach it to the shelf, and it will probably provide enough support for the applied torque.\r\n\r\nIf this is not good enough, you could drill a couple of holes and use some screws."
