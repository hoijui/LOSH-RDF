function = "Similar to the thing it derives from, except this time it mounts onto a servo horn.  Typically a round one of roughly 20mm in diameter.  \r\n\r\nThis thing allows you to mount an 'arm' onto a servo using an embedded circular servo horn.  It has a total of 12 mounting holes, to match those on the servo horn, although you're likely only to use 4 of them.\r\n\r\nMaterial was removed from the middle in an effort to reduce the potential for warping, and to make the print time shorter.  It should still have the same strength and rigidity for the typical uses of this thing.\r\n\r\nAlso, instead of accomodating a 608 ball bearing, this one accepts a simple bushing on the end.  This is a simpler and cheaper linkage joint."
