function: "I need to hang a large wooden dowel in my closet to hold onto all my hangers.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a Pole Socket.  It comes in a matched set.  One side is a closed socket, and the other side is half closed.  This allows you to mount them on opposite walls, slide the pole into the closed one,and drop it into the half open holder on the other side.\r\n\r\nThere's a counter sunk hole in the center of each so a nice flat head screw can nestle in there and not get in the way.\r\n\r\nI do want to add some little support, or rounding, or something to the outside of the socket so it is more stable in practice."
