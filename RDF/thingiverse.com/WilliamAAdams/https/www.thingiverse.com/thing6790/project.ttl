    okh:function """I told my daughter to go running around the house noting things that we could create designs for.  One of the things she came up with was the typical 'over the top of the door' hanger.  After some brainstorming, we determined there was no point in just making the standard variety that you can purchase in the store.  We thought it would be better to have a modular system whereby you could assemble a specific type of hanger based on putting together very simple parts.\r
\r
This thing is the modular door hanger system.  It consists of a base hanger, which is the part that goes over the door.  The base has a trapezoid shaped inverted 'V' groove which will take attachments that you can slide into place.\r
\r
Along with this base, there is a very simple sample of a loop, which can be used to hang different things.\r
\r
Don't be misled.  This is not just a coat hanger.  It can be anything, and you can create an infinite variety of attachments to slide into the little groove.  You can even use them in pairs to hang more complex things.\r
\r
At any rate, there you go.  One more set of things for the home.  \r
\r
Go create some nifty attachments.\r
\r
Everything is parametric, based on the thickness of the door.""" ;
