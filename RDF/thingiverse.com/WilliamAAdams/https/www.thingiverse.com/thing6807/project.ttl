\r
This thing provides a horizontally oriented hold for easy attachment of things.  This attachment probably works better if you want to do something like put a clothes hanger through the loop.\r
\r
UPDATE:  Oddly enough, I had intended to publish this thing a couple months back when I did the original hanging system.  There it sat in my things "unpublished", until I just noticed today as I was making a derivative of it.  Go figure.""" ;
