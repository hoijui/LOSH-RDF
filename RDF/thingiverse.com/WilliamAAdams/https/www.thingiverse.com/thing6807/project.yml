function: "Now that I have the basic door hanger thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6790 , I want to create various attachments to go with it.\r\n\r\nThis thing provides a horizontally oriented hold for easy attachment of things.  This attachment probably works better if you want to do something like put a clothes hanger through the loop.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  Oddly enough, I had intended to publish this thing a couple months back when I did the original hanging system.  There it sat in my things \"unpublished\", until I just noticed today as I was making a derivative of it.  Go figure."
