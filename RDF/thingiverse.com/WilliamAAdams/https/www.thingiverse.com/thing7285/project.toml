function = "Not strictly a derivative, but in the same set as this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7264\r\n\r\nIn building space frames that integrate solid rods, it's useful to have some varients, such as double sockets, and even triple sockets.\r\n\r\nThis thing provides the double socket varient.  It's really good at helping you construct things like trestle bridges and other structures that need to fit multiple struts together, joining to a solid rod.\r\n\r\nThe default size on this part will slide onto a 5/16\" rod, with a slight amount of friction.  You can easily change the OpenScad file to fit whatever rod size you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has the same sized holes as the single socket, and other socketed elements, so mix, match, and play around."
