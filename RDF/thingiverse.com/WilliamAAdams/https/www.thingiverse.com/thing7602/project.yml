function: "I have need for a nice harness to hold onto my Gumstix Overo Summit expansion board.\r\n\r\nThis thing isn't so much a derivative, but an application of a set of parameters to the general pcb harness OpenScad tool.\r\n\r\nIt fits the Summit board in such a way that all the connectors are free and clear, for easy connections. \r\n\r\nThe included OpenScad file contains plenty of other ready measured boards in it as well.  It's fairly easy to create your own board harnesses.  Just measure, change parameters, print."
