    okh:function """This very 'old' design has been enhanced to provide some support for the clip.  The difference is a rounded cutout on the 'outside' of where the panels come together.  It provides some stiffening to help prevent any flexing the panels might want to do at that point.\r
\r
The basic function of the clip is to bring panels together, without using any screws.  The panels found on MakerBot and Ultimaker builds are typical of a 't-slot' screw and nut design.\r
\r
I have used this design to reconstruct my CupCake as documented here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5219""" ;
