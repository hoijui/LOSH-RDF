\r
This thing has an internal taper which allows you to slide the rod in straight for a certain distance, then it tapers towards the top for a tighter friction fit.\r
\r
\r
There is now an opening in the top, so that if you want to fasten your rod into the sleeve, you can easily just poor a bit of epoxy into the opening.  The exposure to air should make for a better epoxy cure than if there were no hole.\r
\r
This one mates perfectly with this other thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8130\r
\r
The two combined form a fairly tight joint with very little wiggle.""" ;
