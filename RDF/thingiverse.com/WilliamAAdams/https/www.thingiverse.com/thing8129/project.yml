function: "I wanted to improve this joint component for a better fit on rods.\r\n\r\nThis thing has an internal taper which allows you to slide the rod in straight for a certain distance, then it tapers towards the top for a tighter friction fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is now an opening in the top, so that if you want to fasten your rod into the sleeve, you can easily just poor a bit of epoxy into the opening.  The exposure to air should make for a better epoxy cure than if there were no hole.\r\n\r\nThis one mates perfectly with this other thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8130\r\n\r\nThe two combined form a fairly tight joint with very little wiggle."
