    okh:function """I needed to make the fitting of the clevis a bit tighter so the elbows would not be so wobbly.\r
\r
This thing is a little bit more precise, when mated with the current female version: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8129\r
\r
By default, the diameter of the opening is 1/4", which is perfect to fit a steel dowel pin as an axle.\r
\r
The depth is 3/8" by default, which is perfect to fit two of these on the ends of a steel dowel pin that is 1 1/4", leaving 1/2" gap between them.\r
\r
So, these two things combined form a nice elbow joint where one end is 1/4" and the other is 5/16", or whatever sizes you need.""" ;
