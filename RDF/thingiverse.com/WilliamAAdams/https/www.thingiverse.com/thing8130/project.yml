function: "I needed to make the fitting of the clevis a bit tighter so the elbows would not be so wobbly.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a little bit more precise, when mated with the current female version: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8129\r\n\r\nBy default, the diameter of the opening is 1/4\", which is perfect to fit a steel dowel pin as an axle.\r\n\r\nThe depth is 3/8\" by default, which is perfect to fit two of these on the ends of a steel dowel pin that is 1 1/4\", leaving 1/2\" gap between them.\r\n\r\nSo, these two things combined form a nice elbow joint where one end is 1/4\" and the other is 5/16\", or whatever sizes you need."
