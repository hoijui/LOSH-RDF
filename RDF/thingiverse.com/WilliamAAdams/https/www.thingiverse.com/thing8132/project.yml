function: "Now that I'm pretty sure about the way in which I want to hold tools on my PolyBot, I need a single piece effector (tool holder).\r\n\r\nThis derivative puts the axle mounts on the base plate directly.  This makes for a single piece to print instead of the keyed version it derives from.\r\n\r\nThe axle holes are designed to take a sleeve bearing (OD - 3/8\", ID - 1/4\", length - 1/2\").  It is a very tight fit, and you might need to use a vise to get the sleeve bearings into the axle mounts.  Once you do though, you have a nice axle where you can attach a male clevis: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8130\r\n\r\nIf you use a 1 1/4\" steel dowel pin as the axle, you will have a nice, minimal wiggle, axle/joint combination.\r\n\r\nAlthough the axle mounts are angled outward, it is still a tight fit for a tool to be mounted.  A future design might change this arrangement.  In the meantime, you can simply print the tool larger to get more separation.\r\n\r\nThis is challenging to print as there's a lot of surface area, and it will tend to want to warp.  So, print with a high raft to absorb some of that warpage."
