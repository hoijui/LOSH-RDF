    okh:function """I have need to work with angle metal.  I want to create various fittings to allow attaching an angled thing to walls, other things, and other pieces of metal, rods, and whatnot.\r
\r
This thing is a base form upon which other angle metal fixtures will be created.  By default it was designed as a slip on sleeve to fit 1/8" X 3/4" angle aluminum.\r
\r
With the OpenScad, you can easily change the size of the fixture.  You can change the thickness (1/8") or the extent (3/4"), and the length of the sleeve.  You can also mess with the "tightness" of the fit if you want something more stiff, rather than slidey.""" ;
