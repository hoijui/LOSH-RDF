function: "I have need to work with angle metal.  I want to create various fittings to allow attaching an angled thing to walls, other things, and other pieces of metal, rods, and whatnot.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a base form upon which other angle metal fixtures will be created.  By default it was designed as a slip on sleeve to fit 1/8\" X 3/4\" angle aluminum.\r\n\r\nWith the OpenScad, you can easily change the size of the fixture.  You can change the thickness (1/8\") or the extent (3/4\"), and the length of the sleeve.  You can also mess with the \"tightness\" of the fit if you want something more stiff, rather than slidey."
