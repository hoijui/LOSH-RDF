function = "In working with angle metal, I have need to place an end cap on either end of a piece.\r\n\r\nThis thing takes the base form, and fills in the end, to make a convenient end cap.  By default it is sized for 1/8\" X 3/4\" angle metal.  Using the OpenScad, you can change many of the sizing parameters.\r\n\r\nThe fitting is comfortable, meaning it goes on easy and comes off easy.  If you want a tighter fit, you might want to make the extents, or the thickness slightly smaller.  That, or just put a dab of hot glue in the slot before you slip the metal inside."
