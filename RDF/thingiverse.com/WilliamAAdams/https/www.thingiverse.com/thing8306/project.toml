function = "Seeing as how Tetrahedrons are a fairly basic building block, I'm always looking for new ways to construct them.  I have been somewhat inspired by the makings of mrkim.  I went out and bought some vinyl tubing to play with.  while I was playing with it for motor shaft couplings, I got the bright idea that it could make for pretty easy vertices for round shafts as well.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a simple vertex constructed from vinyl tubing.  There are no actual files, only pictures that show the technique."
