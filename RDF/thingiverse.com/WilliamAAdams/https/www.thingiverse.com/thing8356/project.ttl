    okh:function """I want to build a modular system that allows me to hang things on a straight rail mounted a few millimeters from the wall.  In my office at work, I have one of those hanging rail systems that allows me to attach a whiteboard, or book case, or whatever.  Well, I want that for the home.\r
\r
This set of things slip over a straight piece of aluminum or steel and provide some mounting holes.  These jackets can be screwed into a wall or other surface, and provide a convenient attachment rail system.\r
\r
There is an end cap, and a 'slip' jacket.  The end caps secure the end, and the slip jacket can secure a midpoint.\r
\r
Of course, it's a base form, so once you have the thing mounted on the surface, you can construct various other things that can slide onto the rail as well.\r
\r
This thing works with 1/8" X 3/4" aluminum by default.  The OpenScad is provided, so you can construct any size you like by just changing a couple of parameters.""" ;
