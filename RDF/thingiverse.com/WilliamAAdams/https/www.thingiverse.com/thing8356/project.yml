function: "I want to build a modular system that allows me to hang things on a straight rail mounted a few millimeters from the wall.  In my office at work, I have one of those hanging rail systems that allows me to attach a whiteboard, or book case, or whatever.  Well, I want that for the home.\r\n\r\nThis set of things slip over a straight piece of aluminum or steel and provide some mounting holes.  These jackets can be screwed into a wall or other surface, and provide a convenient attachment rail system.\r\n\r\nThere is an end cap, and a 'slip' jacket.  The end caps secure the end, and the slip jacket can secure a midpoint.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's a base form, so once you have the thing mounted on the surface, you can construct various other things that can slide onto the rail as well.\r\n\r\nThis thing works with 1/8\" X 3/4\" aluminum by default.  The OpenScad is provided, so you can construct any size you like by just changing a couple of parameters."
