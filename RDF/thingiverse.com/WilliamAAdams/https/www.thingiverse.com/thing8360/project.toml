function = "This is actually a mash up between this derived thing, and this other thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8356\r\n\r\nThe idea is that once you have a flat rail mounted against a surface, you'll want to attach various things to it.\r\n\r\nThis thing combines a simple hoop with the slip fitting for the rail.  \r\n\r\nWith it attached to the rail, you can then hang a coat, or slip some tubing in there and do other stuff.  Maybe it's a support for cabling, or curtain rod.  Who knows.\r\n\r\nThis thing does not have good support.  It can benefit from having some fillet added to the standoff to make it really supportive.  But, you can get the general idea."
