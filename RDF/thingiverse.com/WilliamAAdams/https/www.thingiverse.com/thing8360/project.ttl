\r
The idea is that once you have a flat rail mounted against a surface, you'll want to attach various things to it.\r
\r
This thing combines a simple hoop with the slip fitting for the rail.  \r
\r
With it attached to the rail, you can then hang a coat, or slip some tubing in there and do other stuff.  Maybe it's a support for cabling, or curtain rod.  Who knows.\r
\r
This thing does not have good support.  It can benefit from having some fillet added to the standoff to make it really supportive.  But, you can get the general idea.""" ;
