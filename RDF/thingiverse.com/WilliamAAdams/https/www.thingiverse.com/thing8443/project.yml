function: "After playing around with fillets on this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8416  I was determined to create a generalized Bezier function for usage in OpenScad.\r\n\r\nThis thing, or rather the OpenScad file, is public domain code for creating Bezier curves within OpenScad.\r\n\r\nIt is a foundational piece.  It will only create Bezier curves defined by 4 control points.  Those are typically the most useful in hand constructed graphics as found in OpenScad.\r\n\r\nHopefully this little piece of goodness will enable people to create very curvacious things in OpenScad.  Extending the function to 3D can be easily done.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Added a couple more pictures that show different ways of using the beast.  Perhaps the coolest is using a Bezier curve to change color over the surface of the object."
