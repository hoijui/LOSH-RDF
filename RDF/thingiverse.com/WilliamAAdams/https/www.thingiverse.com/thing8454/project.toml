function = "Perhaps it's bad form to create a derivative of your own thing when it's just a code update rather than an actual 'thing' but...\r\n\r\nThis thing incorporates a couple more changes to the Bezier functions.  First, it adds a 3 element version of the PointOnBezCubic() function.  So, there's now 2D and 3D.  The 3D version can be used for x,y,z values, or for r,g,b values, as demonstrated in the pictures.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of pictures, I've added an example of how to use color with the bezier curve to give your images that groovy ramped color goodness.  I expect to do very bad things with this.\r\n\r\nSome more factoring and commenting of the code should make it fairly easy to understand.\r\n\r\nBut, all that goodness was added so that I could actually create BezierStrips!  Just think of it.  You give the function two sets of control points (4 points each), and it will generate an extruded strip that is 'in between' the two curves.  Curve1 is on 'top' and Curve2 is on 'bottom', but actually it doesn't matter what their orientation is.\r\n\r\nThis is really great for creating things like handles for cups, or funky looking springy feet, or vert ramps for skateboard parks.\r\n\r\nJust more Bezier goodness.\r\n\r\nOne of the pictures shows a bell shaped thing.  that's just a Bezier strip rotated around the z-axis an appropriate number of times.  Can be used to make very interesting other shapes no doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd who knew OpenScad was able to render things so nicely!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: If you're interested in more words on this design, you can take a look here: http://williamaadams.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/mr-bezier-goes-to-openscad/"
