\r
This thing is a very slight modification to the test_bezier.scad file.  It includes a DisplayBezSurface(mesh) routine which will actually draw the surface using polyhedron to place the triangle patches.\r
\r
That makes the final stage a whole lot easier.  Now, instead of trying to use the polygon, and project it into position, I can simply use the polyhedron, and construct an appropriately shaped polyhedron to get the patches at the desired thickness!\r
\r
So, once I do that, I'll go to version 0.9, and 1.0 will be when it's all nicely packaged up into a couple of clean library files.\r
\r
One more step, one more pretty picture.\r
\r
With this technique, now any parametric surface is possible, including b-spline and the like.""" ;
