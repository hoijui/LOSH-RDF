function = "So, what are Bezier curves good for if you're not going to do much with them?\r\n\r\nThis thing is a simple boat created out of Bezier surfaces.  I define a bow, and a midship section, and a stern, then just stitch a few of them together.  In the picture can be seen how the control mesh looks.\r\n\r\nThis particular one shows how you have to print in a couple of halves and bring them together.  This is an artifact of the linear extrusion offered by the OpenScad bezier library.\r\n\r\nThis model takes about 3 minutes to generate the .stl from the .scad.  Not too bad."
