\r
This thing isn't so much a derivation of the original, as much as a reconstitution.  It provides for a good parametric basis for creating other such things.\r
\r
You can specify the size of the bar in one place, and the handles and grippers will adjust accordingly.\r
\r
The arm has a cutout to reduce the amount of plastic used to print the thing.  This is a good savings, and in these sizes, it doesn't really change the strength dynamics.\r
\r
The handle and grip are a friction/slip fit.  If you want permanence, simply glue it on.  If you want the 'gripper' to be able to rotate, then just make the opening wider, or come up with your own gripper.\r
\r
A good strategy might be to put a dimple inside the gripper, or the handle, to grab onto the hole in the linkage (arm).\r
\r
I thought about printing a pin.  But really, a 3mm piece of filament makes for a fine pin.  I'm whimping out of course, and perhaps I'll add one later.""" ;
