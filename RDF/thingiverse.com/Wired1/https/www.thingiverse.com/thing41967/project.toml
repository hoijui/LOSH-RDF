function = "This is my second printer design and is based on my first printer the OB1 with a reengineered top end. The 1.4 features greatly increased build height  and now has a massive build volume of 200mm x 200mm x 200mm (8\" x 8\" x 8\") with an open front design yet is still 100% printable on an existing reprap printer.\r\n\r\nThe aim here was to make a larger volume printer that did not need specialist parts, laser cutting or CNC machinery to make. The 1.4 designation comes from the new side frames resembling the number '4'.\r\n\r\nIf you have already built the earlier OB1 printer you can reuse a lot of the original plastic parts as well as all of the extrusions although this new printer uses less extrusion and some will require shortening.\r\n\r\nThe x-axis ends and carriage are now included but have not yet been tested hence the \"work in progress\" label.\r\n\r\nI may yet design a standard x-carriage to take a Wades type extruder but if anyone else wants to have a go the X-axis rails are 55mm spacing 8mm diameter linear rods."
