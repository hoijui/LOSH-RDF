function: "Backlash is an ugly truth. The Lash module in Skeinforge produces Gcode that's even uglier. It's default settings are more likely to confuse you than correct your print. But breaking backlash down, one axis at a time can start to teach you more about your printer's capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe Lash module might not be something you employ all the time, but understanding how you can use it to improve a print is certainly worth knowing."
