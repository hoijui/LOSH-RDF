function = "This is the carriage for a personalised Mendel90 currently under construction. The smaller carriage will accept a multi-material bowden extruder or perhaps a smaller direct drive.\r\n\r\nThe flexors connecting to the third bearing mount are shorter than they should be. But remodelling has been postponed until I learn openSCAD. Meanwhile the corresponding 40mm fan duct is on the drawing board and will be published soon."
