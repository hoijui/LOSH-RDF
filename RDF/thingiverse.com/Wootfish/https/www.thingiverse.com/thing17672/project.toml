function = "Dodecahedron loudspeakers radiate sound in all directions. They also look really cool. This project uses a parametric program that allows anyone to create a dodecahedron loudspeaker using any size speaker.  We chose three-inch speakers since they were inexpensive and available.  Hope you enjoy!\r\nUpdate: there is a revised version of this project at: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21272 which includes an improved generator script.  Thanks!"
