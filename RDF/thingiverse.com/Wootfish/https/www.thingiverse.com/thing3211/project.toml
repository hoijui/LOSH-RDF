function = "We ended up using a clear power supply which had a fan on the bottom of it's case.  We drilled a hole into the bottom of makerbot 1280 to allow the fan to function, and decided to make some feet to futher support the makerbot and allow more air to reach the fan.  A nice side effect of this is that the blue leds that are in the fan shine out the bottom of the device, giving it a nice unearthly glow."
