function: "Proof that dinosaurs and man coexisted, the ColberT-rex was a cunning linguist that would distract you with it's verbosity all the while stealing a slice of your fresh pizza pie (using his pizza slicer tail).\r\n\r\nThought to have gone extinct when early man adopted a strict no-carb diet, rumors abound that it has been spotted lurking outside the Pappa John's in Orlando.\r\n\r\nUPDATE - Finally got a 3D Printer and made a printable version of this bad boy. Still working on the glasses, they are a bitch."
