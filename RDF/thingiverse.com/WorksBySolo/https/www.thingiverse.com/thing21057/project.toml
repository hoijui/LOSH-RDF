function = "UPDATE: NEW UPLOAD that has four clamps grouped together. These will fit on a 120mm x 120 mm build plate.\r\n\r\nThis is a reversable hold-down clamp used on work surfaces with t-slots. Use with thin work pieces one way, or flip around to fit thicker stock. This is based on a collection of different clamps I've seen while browsing woodworking tool retailers."
