function = "This model is derived from a 123D Catch scan of a cast resin creature we've had in our yard for several years. I can find no artist or manufacturer markings on the original object, to credit them.\r\n\r\nThe 123D Catch result was really clean. I did touch it up somewhat in Cinema 4D Sculpt module. Also added the base."
