function = "I need a stand that i can put my iphone in to record me doing Tae Kwon Do when no one is around to film me. This stand should allow you to change the angle that the phone is facing to get just that right framing of your shot. Not sure about the size fo the casing that goes aorund the phone, i plan to sand back the edges to get everything to fit just right. I also made the hexagon on the stand part slightly smaller then the hole on the holder, might change it back to the same size then sand back for a better fit. I have no printer to test my designs to if any one does try it out let me know."
