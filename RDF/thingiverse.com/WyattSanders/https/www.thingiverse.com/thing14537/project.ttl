    okh:function """This is sort of an experimental idea to add to the fundamentals of the reprap project. It's a 3d printable replacement for existing recycling T5 timing belts used on repraps. \r
This belt should work with existing timing belt gears, it has a 2mm apex to trough height. It should also allow you to scale up repraps by printing additional sections of the belt and attaching them, and getting longer rods. It's also basically an internal-load modular rack and pinion system\r
\r
the modular pieces now screw together with a regular metric reprap nut and bolt. the threads fit great with this pulley: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7218\r
I also didn't realize it but its a little bit like this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8938\r
I just need to adapt a bracket to catch the belt system, and then it could probably work with existing hardware, and software.\r
