function: "I sometimes need an impromptu diffuser to use with the built-in flash of my SLR camera. \r\n\r\nThis small clip is installed *after* the built-in flash has been deployed, and provides support for a standard business card to be inserted white side up. The flash is thus bounced from the ceiling and lessens the harshness of the flash, e.g. for portraits.\r\n\r\nThanks to TheCase for the original Nikon hotshoe cover model, from which this is derived. I found that the Nikon version had to be scaled by 0.95 to fit the Olympus SLR (E500) hotshoe. May work on other brands of SLR, depending on the configuration of the built-in flash - let me know if it works on your Canon or Nikon!"
