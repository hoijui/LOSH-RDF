function = "I adapted the current Prusa Mendel endstop by shortening the arm and moving a hole, to allow a standard 80mm PC case fan to be mounted on one of the lower side threaded rods. \r\n\r\nThe fan blows across the build plate opposite the nozzle, and allows for extra cooling rates, particularly useful when printing small layers, or for preserving detail in others."
