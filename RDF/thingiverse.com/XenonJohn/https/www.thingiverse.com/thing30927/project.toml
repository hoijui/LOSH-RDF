function = "The PodBreakout plug allows experimenters to connect the 30 pin iPod socket to external devices, such as a microcontroller. However, it is an ungainly shape and the full 30 pin version has a circuit board of solder terminals that sticks out of the back of the plug, rendering it susceptible to damage. \r\nThis docking port allows you to glue the PodBreakout in place at one end, holds the cable securely, and is shaped to allow you to slide an iPodTouch into a socket at the other end so that it connects accurately with the plug and keeps the whole assembly securely connected."
