function: "The M2 from Makergear is not shipped with nor do they supply a 3mm version of their extruder for it. I redrew the extruder in cad and modified it to work with 3mm filament. \r\n\r\nI am new to 3D printing and this is my first printer so I am still getting used to it all. Most of my issues have been with the settings in slic3r. I have not managed to print a part with support that looked at all decent so I built the only support needed into the file. If you desire I will work on and upload a no support version.\r\n\r\nSo far I have printed about 750 grams through it with no issues. I am getting a little bulging in the corners on a cube but that is likely a setting I need to change.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nThe V2 file has larger clearances on the bolt holes and inset for the stepper. I did not include the support in the bearing slot like the first file so it should be printed with support enabled. If you want the built in support back leave a comment and I will work on that as well.\r\n\r\nSomethings to keep in mind when embarking on this quest. The guide tube that is supplied with the M2 is not going to be big enough for the 3mm filament so you should get a 6mm OD X 4mm ID PTFE tube to replace it. I tried it without the tube and I think it puts to much side pressure on the X carriage while printing. You will need a 3mm hot end from Makergear. You will need to re-determine your Z-offset since the new head is likely to be at a slightly different height than the old one."
