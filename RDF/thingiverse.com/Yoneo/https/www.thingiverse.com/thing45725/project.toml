function = "*UPDATE - I have updated the Pencil Bow to V2. It has a larger cap/hole so the pencils will actually fit. the old version worked but it required the user to \"stretch\" the hole so pencils would smoothly fire.   \r\n\r\nThis bow will shoot any pencils with a circumference of 7 mm or less. Please Post your Makes!"
