function: "A collection of pieces for your favorite hexagonal board game.  Irritated by how easily your favorite hex game board flies apart in the middle of a heated game? Wish it was beer-proof so you could take it down the pub?  Of course you do!  \r\nIf you print this, see also my folding storage box for holding these pieces- it transforms into a spinning card organizer."
