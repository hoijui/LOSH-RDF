function = "The model was created in Autodesk Inventor 2011, using only 90 degree angles to maintain its rigid appearance.  It was designed to stand up on a desk or computer, and was inspired by the music duo Daft Punk.  Additionally, the design was meant to test the resolution of the makerbot.  The medallion was supposed to have four steps in the center of it, but the actual print is less exact.  \r\n     Due to the loosening of the thumbscrew that holds the filament, one layer of RoboDude is noticeably smaller than the rest.  Near the bottom of the figure, the front starts to peel off.  This was be corrected with a small amount of glue.  In the future the figurine may be painted"
