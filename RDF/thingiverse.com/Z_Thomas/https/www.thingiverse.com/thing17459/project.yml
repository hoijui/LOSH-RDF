function: "Shear is a guillotine style cigar cutter that uses a standard, utility knife razor blade to do the cutting.   \n\nThe advantage of this design is the replaceable blade.  I chose to use the utility blade because it is an extremely easy to find and affordable razor. Only half of the razor is used to cut, so just like a utility knife, you can simply flip the blade once it is dull to have a new, sharp edge. This makes this design superior to many conventional cigar cutters, which become nearly useless after the fixed blade becomes dull.   \n\nThe only additional hardware required is a 6-32 x 3/8 machine screw and nut. These can be found in packages containing 14 sets at many hardware stores including Lowe's and Home Depot for about $1.00  \n\nor, if you prefer metric:  \n\nThere is another version that uses a 10mm M3 screw and M3 nut  \n\nEnjoy!  \n-  \nA Relative Design project.  \nhttp://www.relativedesign.us/blog  \n\nSee all our projects Here:  \nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/tag:relative_design"
