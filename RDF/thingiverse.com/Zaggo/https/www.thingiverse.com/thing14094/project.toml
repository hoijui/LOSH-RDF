function = "The Teardrop are is a geometrical shape which is used whenever a horizontal hole is printed.\r\nThis avoids overhangs greater than 45Â° at the top of the hole, which are not (or at least not easily and clean) printable on FDM printers without support material.\r\n\r\nThe problem with teardrop holes is, that they need considerably more space. This can be a real problem, when the main object is limited in size for one reason or another.\r\n\r\nFlat Teardrops solve this problem.\r\nThe solution is simple. Although overhangs > 45Â° are a problem in 3D printing, reasonably short bridges arenâ€™t!\r\nSo why not just cut off the dead space in the tip of a teardrop?\r\n\r\nSee http://pleasantsoftware.com/developer/3d/2011/11/29/flat-teardrop/ for more details."
