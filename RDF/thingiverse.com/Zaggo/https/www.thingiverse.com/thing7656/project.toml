So itâ€™s no problem to print GCode from MakerBot Unicorn designs directly on the SphereBot.\r\nThanks to the excellent Inkscape plugin from Marty McGuire (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5986), itâ€™s easily possible to convert all kinds of vector drawings (eps, svg, etc) to printable GCode.\r\n\r\nThe firmware is open source and can be found here:\r\nhttp://pleasantsoftware.com/developer/3d/spherebot/\r\n\r\nA video of the SphereBot in action is available on YouTube:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8KnW9AQ10E\r\n\r\n[Update 04/09/2011]\r\nMeanwhile I drew plans for the wooden parts (left & right side and the X-axis stepper motor retainer plate). See \r\nSphereBotWoodenParts.pdf below.\r\n\r\n[Update 04/10/2011]\r\nI just uploaded STL and SCad files for the printed parts.\r\n\r\n[Update 04/11/2011]\r\nThe SphereBotSender GUI is now also available in a Processing implementation, i.e. it runs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.\r\nSee 'SphereBotSenderBinaries.zip' below.\r\n\r\nThe Sources are available on GitHub, \r\nsee http://pleasantsoftware.com/developer/3d/spherebot/ for the links."
