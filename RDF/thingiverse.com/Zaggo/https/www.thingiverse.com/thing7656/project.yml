function: "Eastern is coming and I'll be visited by dear friends and their children. \r\nSo I need some Easter attraction for them :)\r\n\r\nThe SphereBot can plot images on spherical objects like table tennis balls, golf balls, eggs etc.\r\nIt is inspired by the original EggBot by EvilMadScientist, but built from 2 old stepper motors and some steel rods (all cannibalized from old flatbed scanners), some MDF and plywood and a few 3d printed parts (printed with my MakerBot Cupcake).\r\n\r\nThe electronics are simply an Arduino and two Polulu A4983 stepper motor drivers (on the bread board).\r\n\r\nThe custom Arduino firmware directly interprets GCode sent over the serial port. So it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s no problem to print GCode from MakerBot Unicorn designs directly on the SphereBot.\r\nThanks to the excellent Inkscape plugin from Marty McGuire (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5986), it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s easily possible to convert all kinds of vector drawings (eps, svg, etc) to printable GCode.\r\n\r\nThe firmware is open source and can be found here:\r\nhttp://pleasantsoftware.com/developer/3d/spherebot/\r\n\r\nA video of the SphereBot in action is available on YouTube:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8KnW9AQ10E\r\n\r\n[Update 04/09/2011]\r\nMeanwhile I drew plans for the wooden parts (left & right side and the X-axis stepper motor retainer plate). See \r\nSphereBotWoodenParts.pdf below.\r\n\r\n[Update 04/10/2011]\r\nI just uploaded STL and SCad files for the printed parts.\r\n\r\n[Update 04/11/2011]\r\nThe SphereBotSender GUI is now also available in a Processing implementation, i.e. it runs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.\r\nSee 'SphereBotSenderBinaries.zip' below.\r\n\r\nThe Sources are available on GitHub, \r\nsee http://pleasantsoftware.com/developer/3d/spherebot/ for the links."
