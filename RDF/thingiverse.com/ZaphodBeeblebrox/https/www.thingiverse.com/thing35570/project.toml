function = "It's a printable clone of the lasercut X-carriage parts for the Rapman.\r\n\r\nIf the brittle acrylic part is starting to crack after years of abuse, why not make a new one out of printer plastic? Copied straight out of BitsFromBytes's original CAD drawings, it's an exact duplicate of the original.\r\n\r\nI've got one on my printer already, and it's working just as well as the acrylic one did."
