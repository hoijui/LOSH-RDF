function = "Meant to upgrade a Makerbot, Reprap, or Rapman. Print your own instead of hunting all over the world for the bearings you need. Designed from the specs of McMasterCarr: http://www.mcmaster.com/#ball-and-roller-bearings/=9giio9\r\n\r\nDesigned on Autocad Inventor 2011. \r\n\r\nHas printed. Does not work when converted by BFB AXON Software. Some of the sticks fuse together, and it doesn't rotate. I'll update this around 3pm tomorrow with the revised edition.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Scaled up the little tiny baby bearing by 10. It's proper size now."
