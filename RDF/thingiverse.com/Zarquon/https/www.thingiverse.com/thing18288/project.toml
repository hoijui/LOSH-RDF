function = "This is a mounting bracket to hold a piece of 5/16 inch (8mm) threaded rod at a right angle to a wall for holding a filament spool.  It uses a captive nut in the back to hold the rod in place.\r\n\r\nI plan to coil small sections of filament cut from a bundle on this after the current spool runs out as the humidity control in my apartment isn't the best and I don't want to expose a full roll to it. I'm going to add a winding handle to make that easier but my printer is down for emergency repairs."
