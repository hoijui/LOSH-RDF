I needed something to leave behind in the ones I visit.\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the Wikipedia page on geocaching, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching, you can see the logo I based this on.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s intended to be a keychain but the single joint between the outer ring and inner logo may make it too fragile for that.  I havenâ€™t carried one around for long enough to tell."
