function = "Hey public libraries! If you have \"library\" in your username send me a message and I would love to put you in touch with the library director. Also, I'd be happy to put your library name on a keychain or something else fun to print. :)  \n\nMy local library recently got it's first 3D printer: the Replicator with dual extrusion! We needed something to demo to people who are interested in it and for our classes on using it. So this is what I made. It's a keychain!  \n\nThis has been a great quick print and now is in the hands of many library visitors interested in 3D printing. It has also made it's way into the hands of one of out senators!"
