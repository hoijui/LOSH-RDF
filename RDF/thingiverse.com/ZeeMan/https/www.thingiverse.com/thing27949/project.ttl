My local library recently got it's first 3D printer: the Replicator with dual extrusion! We needed something to demo to people who are interested in it and for our classes on using it. So this is what I made. It's a keychain!  

This has been a great quick print and now is in the hands of many library visitors interested in 3D printing. It has also made it's way into the hands of one of out senators!""" ;
