    okh:function """3/8 inch guard for the Oster 76. The 3/8 size breaks a lot so I made a printable replacement for my mother (my personal barber).   

Infill: 10-15. DO NOT exceed 40% other wise it will peel up due to cooling. even 30% may be to much.  
Shells:1. Any more and you will have to file the edges to make it fit.  
No raft. It makes the underside rough.  

UPDATE 12/27/12: Printed v4.2 and it looks and works great but is a little pokey. Also this is a very sturdy piece. So for this up date there is a couple of different types. on v4.4 I made the back side of the prongs shorter so they won't hit the scalp. I also made a second test version, v4.5, in which I removed the tip from the front of the prongs hoping it will lessen scratchiness. Also in this update I added a picture of v.4.2 guard (on the left)  next to the factory guard ( on the right). Cheers!  


UPDATE 3/4/13: Printed v4.5 and it's most definiatly the way to go! much more comforable on the head. Also added pictures of v4.5 (red) both in use and on its own.  

UPDATE 3/29/13  
Added v5.0. This should be the most comfortable so far with the sight curve in the front but I have not printed it and they might suffer from overhanging edges. Also on this update I took down some of the older files (to give the downloads a cleaner look).  If you would still like some of the old files send me a message and I can email them to you.  

UPDATE 4/14/13  
Added better instructions for printing after trying to print at 100% then 50% infill. v4.5 still seems the best way to go.  

Please let me know if they work for you or if you make them! :)""" ;
