function: "This is an Inventor drawing of the v1.2 mechanical endstop. It's not super fancy, Just good enough to show precice locations of the holes, and blocks of space where things can't go.\r\n\r\nI created it to help in my design for an endstop mount where I needed to make sure that things would have enough space."
