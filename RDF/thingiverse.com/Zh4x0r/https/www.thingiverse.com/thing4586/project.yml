function: I was able to get my MakerBot printing the square test parts fine, but when I printed this, I realized that much more tuning was needed. I'm not sure how to tune the MakerBot using this part, but I know it would help, since the default settings make several very obvious errors with it, such as burying the nozzle in the plastic during the upper layers.
