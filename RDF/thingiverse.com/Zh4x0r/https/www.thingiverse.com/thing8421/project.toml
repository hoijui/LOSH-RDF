function = "I loved the original spool holder's design, but have a Cupcake sitting on a little shelf, where there's not much room for things to stick out the sides of the bot. I modified the design to be able to hang off a vertical 20.5mm board (the wall of the shelf) However, it needs to be printed in two parts, because of overhangs. Haven't printed it yet, but will soon!"
