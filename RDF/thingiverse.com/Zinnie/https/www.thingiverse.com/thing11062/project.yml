function: "\"There were once three brothers who were travelling along a lonely, winding road at twilight. In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure...\" http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Three_Brothers\r\n\r\nIf you don't know what this is, it's probably worth nothing. But if you're a Harry Potter nerd (like I am, and everybody of my generation), welcome to the Potterverse. I made this model while playing around with SketchUp 8 and I'm hoping to make plenty more 'things'!"
