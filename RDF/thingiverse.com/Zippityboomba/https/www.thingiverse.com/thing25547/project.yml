function: 'My uncle George (1943-1968) grew up in a one-room farm house in the Ozarks. This truck was one of his few toys. Don''t know who made it, but the price is still marked on the bottom: $0.35. I copied it in Sketchup, so I could make replicas for all the grand-nephews he never met. Then I thought, why not print it? The print cost: $1.45. No way my version will last 65+ years (even if PLA isn''t biodegradable).'
