function = "A 4-piece model of the famous lift rocket. According to Wikipedia, \"It remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful rocket ever brought to operational status and still holds the record for the heaviest launch vehicle payload.\"\r\n\r\nDesigned to be just about as big as my UM can print. Haven't run it yet, since it will probably take 10+ hours to print.\r\n\r\nI made this from the .3ds model at nasa.gov/multimedia/3d_resources/models.html, and merely sliced it for printing and closed some holes. Cura finds several intersection errors, probably from the nozzles that intersect the base. Still slices fine, though, as far as I can see. If someone has Sketchup Pro and can run the routine that only saves external faces, I'd be much oblidged."
