Printed Parametric Chainmail  



I've been wanting to try this for a while.  This is a sheet of interlocking rings, printed in place.  The rings are basically square, with cut off corners.  Two sets of diagonals cross each other at different heights, with four posts at the corners.  Well, it makes sense when you see the pictures!  



This is the first thing I've designed in OpenSCAD, so the code is probably pretty sloppy.  The major parameters that can be changed are the layer thickness and line width, along with ring size and number.  



I searched for "chainmail" on Thingiverse and the only result was a post by Vik on the Interlocking Rings thing: "Next, chainmail. Right?" So I hope you like this, Vik!""" ;
