function = "This is the Arduino case made for Tecla. It can be easily modified to be an Arduino only case without the Tecla shield socket holes.\r\n\r\nThe case consists of a lid and a bottom portion. The lid slides into the grooves on the bottom piece and snaps securely into place.\r\n\r\nEdit: The images are a bit old so there are a few small errors corrected in the sketchup files. Also, it looks like the holes in the case do not match the model Arduino board. This is because I took the measurements myself and found that the Arduino model was a bit off. The case worked in real life when fabricated."
