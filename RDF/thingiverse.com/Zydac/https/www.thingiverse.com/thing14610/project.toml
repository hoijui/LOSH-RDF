function = "This is an extended Z axis for a Makerbot Cupcake using LM8UU linear bearings and 8mm rods.  It currently prints to a smidge under 200mm.  The idea was to design this around a stiff spine for support using as few parts as possible.\r\n\r\nAlthough this works great, it is a work in progress and I plan to replace the threaded rod from the original Z axis with an Acme rod sometime in the next few weeks.  Even my least wobbly threaded rod is so wobbly that it still has an effect!"
