function = "Still upgrading my Cupcake! This is a compact lightweight Y stage for the Makerbot Cupcake that uses SW4G linear bearings.\r\n\r\nnote 11/1/12:  I added an 8mm version as well since Apparently some Cupcake models use 8mm rods.  This should fit an LM8 linear bearing. This is untested - I am assuming the rod spacing is the same as my model.\r\n\r\n11/3/12  I added two more experimental versions modified to fit the Lowrider - 1/4\" and 8mm versions. Also original Rhino 3d files"
