function: "This is an adapter to attach Brio style wooden toy train tracks to Lego Duplo compatible brick constructions.  The idea was to adapt between two incompatible commercial toy systems, something that would never happen in the retail world.\r\n\r\nUseful for building elevated train tracks, subway stations, Highlines, and crazy buildings with trains going through them. \r\n\r\nThis is a derivative of \"parametric lego duplo by danielkschneider\"\r\n\r\nUpdate:  2010.10.22 I updated the file with a much cleaner rebuilt STL.\r\nUpdate 2019.02.16 Really cleaned it up this time.  No more normal glitches, slices cleanly in Simplify3d"
