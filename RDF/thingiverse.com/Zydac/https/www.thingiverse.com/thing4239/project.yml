function: "Inspired by all the modded Makerbots and Mendels at the Makerfaire last weekend, I designed these mendel styled bearing outriggers for my rattly X-axis carriage.  This slides super smooth and quiet and has definitely improved output quality, especially on tall prints.  Mounting holes could be a bit better situated, but it works and doesn't bump into anything.  \r\n\r\nnote: Small revision to the 180 piece on 9/29 - I added pockets in the reinforcement bump to accommodate the bolt heads. \r\n\r\n11/11 I added files for the individual pieces by request"
