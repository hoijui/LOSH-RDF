function: "I made this thing with Frits Stead i Cam in mind ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14226 ) as I wanted to print my gimbal/handle instead of using off shelf parts.\r\n\r\nAfter printing and assembling it myself, I would like to warn you: if your printer is not perfectly calibrated, you will need an additional tool: a file.\r\nThe stretch plugin for skeinforge might also be of use.. I used slic3r though.\r\n\r\nI like the tight fit on the final assembly, so I like to keep the parts as is. - Remember: it's not plug and play - but it's worth it, if you need it :)\r\n\r\nThe handle is taken directly from Frits design, and modified slightly to fit on a M8 rod."
