MTSKR8 (http://us.misumi-ec.com/us/ItemDetail/10302300140.html) to the Aleph Objects X-Ends (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15492).  This will allow you to convert your Prusa, MendelMax, or other variant to lead screws without having to replace the entire x-end.  This should make the conversion somewhat easier.  \r\n\r\nTested on my machine, works as expected."
