function = "This case is the first part of a larger project to clean up the wiring on my MendelMax.  It contains the RAMPS and an 80mm computer fan.  It has a D-Sub 37 pin connector mounted to the side that pins out every wire on the MendelMax.  There is a D-Sub mount for the frame that plugs directly into the side of the enclosure. You can mount it either outside the frame as shown, or inside if your y-axis allows it. \r\n\r\nThis is still a work in progress."
