function: "I needed something to tilt my desktop music synths up at an angle, so that I didn't have to lean over them to see all the controls. Normally, I'd throw a chunk of wood under them, but I didn't have any suitable pieces. This foot is the result. You can see one of the first designs on the left in the photo. It looks like a cool little rocketship, but the STL was a mess, and it was too complicated for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple revisions, I settled on this design. It has a lip that will catch the rubber or plastic foot of the equipment it is placed under, so it doesn't slide out. The base is larger than the top for stability, and the general shape was chosen to reduce plastic required to build, and reduce print time.\r\n\r\nYes, this is a silly little thing, but I've now got six of them holding up the various gear in my studio!"
