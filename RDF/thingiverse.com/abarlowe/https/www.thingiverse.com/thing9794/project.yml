function: a mount for a 4g ipod for a bicycle. i made it because there was only one mount i could find and it was to big to print on a thing-o-matic which would leave some people out, so i made this one. if there is something wrong with the dementions please notify me. thank you i hope you enjoy it..........you can change it to fit your different generation of ipod or change it to fit one with a case
