function = "The MakerScanner is a completely open source 3D-scanner and the perfect complement to a MakerBot or other 3D printer. Every one of the scanner's plastic parts can be printed on a MakerBot or other 3D printer!   \r\n\r\nUpdate: I've added parts with slightly different tolerances for printing on the Stratasys 3D printers.  \r\n\r\nA lot of folks have asked, so the distance between the camera and the laser is 19.8cm.  You'll find that on line 28 in ScanThread.cpp if you're looking at the source code."
