function = "This is just a placeholder for a fully parametric (openscad scripted) Mendel style vertex. You want it skinny? Want to print quick moulds to fill with resin? Want to add a foot? Want to switch to chunky M10 rod, smaller M6 studding or perhaps carbon-fibre rods?...\r\n\r\nThis script makes sure the resulting part is a drop in replacement for the Standard Mendel (or Huxley) Vertex by following certain design guides, while allowing maximum versatility.\r\n\r\nI will be cleaning up the code in the next few days and then release as soon as possible. Features include:\r\n\r\n* Define height and width of the vertex\r\n* Separately define shell (/wall) thickness for vertex and rod sections.\r\n* Add a shell base layer within the vertex (useful for mould making)\r\n* Specify dimensions of a foot if required\r\n* Define studded rod dimensions and tolerances\r\n* Ability to include grub (wood/) screws for fixing bamboo / dowel / carbon-fibre rods.\r\n\r\nLet me know what features you'd like..."
