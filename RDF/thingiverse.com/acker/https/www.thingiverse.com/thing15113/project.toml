function = "This is the same item as hippiegunnut's http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12307, tweaked very slightly with an optional lid added.  \n\n-- UPDATE 4/13/2013 --  \n\nI added a second type of box: now you can use a sliding lid.  Prints nicely, with a very steep angle in the lip so no overhang problems.  I'm using these as chess boxes, card deck boxes, screw sorters, etc.  \n\nStill fully parametric, of course.  \n\n-- UPDATE 5/6/2013 --  \n\nOkay, finding a lot of uses for this recently.  :)  \n\nI added a parameter to include a coin slot in the lid.  Now it's a divided piggy bank too!  (My 8-year-old son uses it to handle savings, etc. separately.)"
