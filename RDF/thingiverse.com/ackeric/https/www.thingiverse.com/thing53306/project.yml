function: "When I looked at my \"Kiss up in 3D\" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53249 I realized it is half way to letter magnets. So I decided to finish the trip. There are pockets on the back for the magnets. theses should work http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B92YSRY/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\r\n\r\nI will upload a STL, Solidworks and STEP file so you can choose how many of each letter to print. It was just boring enough that I lost interest before I got to the numbers. If anyone really wants numbers let me know I I will make them."
