function: "A simple conveyor belt build platform for the MakerBot. It enables the MakerBot to do multiple prints without user intervention.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial prototype that does not support a heated build platform. I intend to add HBP support at a later time. I'm also still playing with conveyor belt materials. I've started with some Duralar I picked up for an art supply store. It has held up ok so far but more experimentation is required.\r\n\r\nThe intent here is to get the design out so people can play with it."
