function: "This is a derivative of natko's \"Z Axis End Stop - Minimalist\" ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5457 )\r\n\r\nI simply added an adjustable piece that let me use the original endstop holes on the Cupcake case. The slots facilitate coarse adjusting while the set screw allows for fine adjustment. \r\n\r\nI've included natko's STLs here since they are both needed to create this thing. ZstopA.stl is only needed to rebuild z-axis-endstop-v2.stl from the .scad file.\r\n\r\nThis was designed for my MakerBot that has a lowrider xy carriage ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4213 ) in it. I have not tested whether the slots are long enough to support the standard xy carriage. Luckily the design is parametric so it should be easy to extend if you need to."
