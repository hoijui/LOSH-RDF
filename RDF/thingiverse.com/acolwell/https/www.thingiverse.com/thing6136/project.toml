function = "This is a cutting jig for nylon spacers I'm using for the Prusa Mendel I'm building.\r\n\r\nThis is designed for 1/2\" x .328\" x 1\" Nylon spacers I found at Lowe's.\r\n\r\nCurrently the design consists of a DXF file containing the jig profile and an OpenSCAD file that extrudes the profiles into a 3D solid. When I get a little more time, I'll turn this into a proper parametric model."
