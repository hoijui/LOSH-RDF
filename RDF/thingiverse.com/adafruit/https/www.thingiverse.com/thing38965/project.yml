function: "With four 3D printers (so far) in-house, a new staff member from the heart of the 3D community, and #3dthursday, Adafruit has started getting into desktop 3D printing in a big way, especially where these fabrication tools interface with electronics! \r\n\r\nDesktop 3D printers excel in the creation of custom enclosures for compact, dedicated electronics projects. We had seen Jason Welsh's outstanding Folding Arduino Lab (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32839) when it launched this past fall and reached out to him with a special challenge -- to create a practical, modular case for the Raspberry Pi to share with our community!\r\n\r\nJason Welsh who created this design can be found on thingiverse at http://www.thingiverse.com/jasonwelsh, check out his other designs there. He also operates a youtube channel where he instructs many in the field of 3D Modeling, Design and Electronics, which can be found here http://www.youtube.com/cannedmushrooms. He invites you to come on by anytime and learn some new tricks.\r\n\r\nJason Welsh: \xE2\u20AC\u0153I hope this design helps you expand your imagination and guides you in all manner of nerdy ways while dishing out your Pi.\xE2\u20AC\x9D\r\n\r\nWhen sharing this thing please attribute project to Jason Welsh in addition to citing Adafruit per the license selected!"
