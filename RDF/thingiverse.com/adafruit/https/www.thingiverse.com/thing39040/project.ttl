Adafruit's Matt Griffin took a stab at making a watch enclosure that transforms the right angles of the original kit into quite a different friendly, organic shape. And what's more this can be attached to the strap of a backpack or worn as a necklace fob or pocket watch.  



This example design project also includes all of the files and references you need to create your own derivative TIMESQUARE enclosure. Read more about the TIMESQUARE DIY Watch Kit - Red Display Matrix here: https://www.adafruit.com/products/1106""" ;
