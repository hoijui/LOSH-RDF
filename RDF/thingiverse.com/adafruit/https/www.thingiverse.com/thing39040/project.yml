function: "The Adafruit community has been enjoying the new TIMESQUARE DIY Watch kits (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1106) so much that we wanted to offer another fun activity for our community to enjoy!  \n\n\n\nAdafruit's Matt Griffin took a stab at making a watch enclosure that transforms the right angles of the original kit into quite a different friendly, organic shape. And what's more this can be attached to the strap of a backpack or worn as a necklace fob or pocket watch.  \n\n\n\nThis example design project also includes all of the files and references you need to create your own derivative TIMESQUARE enclosure.
