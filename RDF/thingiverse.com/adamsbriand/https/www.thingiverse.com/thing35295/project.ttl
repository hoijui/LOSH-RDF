I created this truck body with lips on the bed's sides into which some other part can be slid.  Currently, there are two swappable parts: a cement mixer, and a dump truck.\r
\r
This was my first attempt to create something from scratch that had "encapsulated wheel-axels" and I realize now that the parts, which are relatively small, sometimes melt together, as with the PLA I used.\r
\r
I tried to fix this with one of those detachable-jawed pliers and a razor-knife.   I had partial success, but this is nothing any competent micro-surgeon shouldn't be able to fix.  Maybe I'll make the thing a bit larger next time.\r
\r
The cement mixer spins, if you work it.  The dumper is supposed to tilt, but I wasn't as patient with it.""" ;
