function: "This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online\r\n\r\nTruck Body/Bed\r\nhttps://tinkercad.com/things/fCN4YMhTmQQ\r\n\r\nCement Mixer:\r\nhttps://tinkercad.com/things/4Ra3JgwyawS\r\n\r\nDump Truck:\r\nhttps://tinkercad.com/things/43HThTLBXk4-truckdumper\r\n\r\nI created this truck body with lips on the bed's sides into which some other part can be slid.  Currently, there are two swappable parts: a cement mixer, and a dump truck.\r\n\r\nThis was my first attempt to create something from scratch that had \"encapsulated wheel-axels\" and I realize now that the parts, which are relatively small, sometimes melt together, as with the PLA I used.\r\n\r\nI tried to fix this with one of those detachable-jawed pliers and a razor-knife.   I had partial success, but this is nothing any competent micro-surgeon shouldn't be able to fix.  Maybe I'll make the thing a bit larger next time.\r\n\r\nThe cement mixer spins, if you work it.  The dumper is supposed to tilt, but I wasn't as patient with it."
