function = "This is a strange puzzle of 2D geometry that I came across some time ago.  It's more fun when you can hold the pieces.\r\n\r\nWith the small triangle at top of the holder tray, the other pieces fill the space.\r\n\r\nBut, if you put the larger triangle at the top, then there is a 1 cm2 space remaining."
