    okh:function """This is AdanA's chamfered Edge Soma Cube, but broken apart by individual pieces.\r
\r
When I attempted to print AdanA's Soma cube, my filament stopped flowing at the 1 1/2 cube height, wrecking three of the pieces.\r
\r
Rather than print them all out again, I separated out the individual pieces.\r
\r
If anyone else needs to print just one replacement, this will save a bit of PLA/ABS.\r
\r
So that I would be less likely to lose the pieces, and having just recently attained the coveted rank of junior-newbie-beginner in openSCAD, I created a box to hold the pieces.\r
\r
Please note that my picture shows my first attempt which turned out to be 2 mm too high.  I've fixed this, but didn't bother to print the correction for myself.""" ;
