function: "My daughter loves narwhals.  I promised to print her something on my ToM.  This was a conversion from a sketchup file by Aerilius on google 3d warehouse.  I scaled, split it in two.  Seems to print well.\r\n\r\nAdded big nose version: The first one is 'anatomically' correct, the second one is a bit more printer friendly."
