function = "This printable extruder is intended to work on RepRap Mendel (both standard and Prusa), RepRap Huxley, and virtually any other open-source 3D printer you can find.\r\n\r\nIt features:\r\n\r\n   1. 1.75 mm filament\r\n   2. Adaptable mounting plate to attach it to virtually any 3D printer\r\n   3. Very compact high-torque NEMA 11 motor\r\n   4. Active ducted fan cooling for high reliability\r\n   5. Wade-style hobbed bolt filament transport\r\n   6. Wing-nut drive to spread the torque loading on the plastic gears\r\n   7. Push-fit hot-end parts - no thread cutting\r\n   8. Easily replaced PTFE liner for the hot end\r\n   9. A single M3-threaded rod cut to lengths makes all the fixings\r\n  10. Lightweight: 420g\r\n  11. Compact design (110 mm x 90 mm x 80 mm) \r\n\r\nI based this design (loosely) on Jstkatz's extruder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7037), in particular, the idea of using a lever to trap the filament against its drive."
