function = "These are spring feet that fit on the bottom of a RepRap machine to damp the transmission of vibrations from the machine to whatever surface it is resting on.\r\n\r\nIf that surface is resonant, a RepRap machine without these feet can make quite a bit of noise.  These reduce that noise significantly."
