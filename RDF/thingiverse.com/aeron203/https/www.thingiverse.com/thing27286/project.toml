function = "This Fractal Cellular procedural texture has been rendered into a volume data cube. It is a non-tiling 8-bit texture at 256 x 256 x 256 voxel resolution. Iso-surface meshes are also provided in PLY and STL. I have also included PNG codec AVI versions, one of which \"fades\" at the edges (for making surfaces that don't end abruptly). \r\nThese textures are from an archive I made nearly a decade ago, by simply sweeping a plane through a procedural texture and rendering out the results. Here are the available formats:\r\n\r\nRAW data 256x256x256 8-bit (zipped), 16MB uncompressed\r\n\r\nBMP sequence 256x256x256 8-bit (zipped), 17MB uncompressed\r\n\r\nPNG codec AVI 256x256x256\r\n\r\nPNG codec AVI 256x256x256 (faded 16vx at edges)\r\n\r\nPLY isosurface mesh 1.6M polygons\r\n\r\nSTL isosurface mesh (reduced) 810K polygons"
