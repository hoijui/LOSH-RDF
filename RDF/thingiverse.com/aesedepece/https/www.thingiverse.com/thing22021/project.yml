function: "I had once a dream where a wise man told me to stare at a wall which was illuminated by a spotlight.\r\n\r\nHe put a little object in between, and it casted a perfectly round shadow on the wall.\r\nThen he spun the object and the shadow shape turned into a perfect square.\r\nEventually he spun it for a second time and shockingly it casted a perfectly equilateral triangle.\r\n\r\nCould you guess how did the object look? (I have deleted the STL preview in order not to spoil you)"
