function: "Update December 7th 2016\r\n---\r\n-- [Complete rewrite of the customizable hinge is now available](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1931310)! It should print immensely easier for most users. I'm going to disable the customizer flag on this, though if you still want to, you can open up the scad script to customize it yourself locally. I do highly recommend switching to the new one though!\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate - April 14th (2014 I think?)\r\n--Added support material  \r\n--Options to print vertical or horizontal (though I don't think horizontal will work very well)  \r\n\r\nCustomizable hinge that prints all at once! You will have to break it free at first.  \r\n\r\nWarning: Hinge does not come apart like many others! (unless it's only got 2 joints)  \r\n\r\nMore to come!  \r\n--Plans to have half-hinge and removable pin options. These will allow you to use the scad to include the hinges as part of your own creations!"
