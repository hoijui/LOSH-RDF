\r
Ever watch your hamster or gerbil running in its wheel, wondering if it's imaging that it's traveling to the exotic reaches of the Earth? Well, now it can! Using this creation you can allow your rodent to transform that rotational energy into a walking robot that uses Theo Jansen's miraculous leg linkage!  \r
\r
All parts were made specifically for this project, not imported, but some things such as the pins will likely be turned into public customizable libraries for others to use after this project is finished.   \r
\r
This project is close to being finished but not quite. Some parts still need finished (wheel to legs assembly) and the gears need printed and tested. The linkage and pins have been printed and work together creating a nice smooth motion. I imagine the wheel itself would be just fine.  \r
\r
I have been a really big fan of 3D printing as of late and have been getting into OpenSCAD modeling. I don't have my own 3D printer but I do have access to a couple hours a week from a local club. My development of shared libraries could really use some personal testing and winning this contest would allow me to create many more things for the public good!  \r
\r
Still working on generating the STL! I'll unlabel this as a WIP when finished and printable!""" ;
