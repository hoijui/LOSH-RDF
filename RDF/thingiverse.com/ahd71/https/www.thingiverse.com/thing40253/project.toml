function = "A replacement mount to the outside \"birthday flag\" which broke (due to long time UV exposure).\r\n\r\nDesigned for a 20mm diameter flagpole.\r\n\r\nI also consider this my first \"Long-time-ABS-outside-experiment\" to see how long it will last and perhaps also print one in PLA to compare.\r\n\r\nThe black one is the printed one and the white one is the old broken original one."
