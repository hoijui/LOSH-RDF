function = "Just a small experiment to get up and running with openSCAD. The script will create a stackable log when given the following three parameters: \r\n\r\n - diameter \r\n - length\r\n - number of slots to include\r\n\r\nThe sets of slots will be evenly spaced, starting at one radius back from the edge. In the case of an odd number of slots, there will be a set in the center. \r\n\r\nI don't yet have a makerbot, so I can't guarantee that the logs will stack well, but they should. If you happen to print any of these and encounter trouble, please leave a comment and I'll try to address it. Thanks!"
