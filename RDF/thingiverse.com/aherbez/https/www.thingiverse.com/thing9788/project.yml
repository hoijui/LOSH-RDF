function: "This is meant to be a way to track damage in World of Darkness pen-and-paper role playing games. In the World of Darkness, damage comes in three flavors: \r\n\r\n- bashing (marked with a single slash)\r\n- lethal (marked as an X)\r\n- aggravated (marked as an asterix)\r\n\r\nThat's all well and good, but in practice, one's character sheet can get a little ragged from all the marking and erasing. Also, gaming is always more fun with dice and counters and markers and the like. So... I made this to give gamers a fun physical way of tracking damage. \r\n\r\nIt also occurred to me while making this that it could be a useful tool for gamers with visual disabilities, since you can feel the different marks. \r\n\r\nEDIT: I just changed it a bit so that the bottom face is completely flat, as it seems like that would likely print better. I've also added a STL with 9 20mm cubes ready for printing."
