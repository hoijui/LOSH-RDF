function: This is Gary. I scanned him with a hand held structured light scanner, and meshed it in meshlab. We also printed him and he actually stands on his own. This is a high quality model with some nice detail, plus the way he is standing with his hands in his pockets makes it great for printing. Dare I say the best full body model on thingiverse?
