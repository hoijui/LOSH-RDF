function = "I'm in the middle of a project that uses multiple BMP085 pressure sensors and wanted a way to test the output of my code.  Here is a test chamber that uses a column of water to maintain pressure.  The water column half of the cylinder has four notches.  The First notch is at the top of the  hole between the two chambers.  There is a notch every inch above that."
