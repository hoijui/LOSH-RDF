function = "This is a replacement spool holder for the MakerBot Replicator 2 (or 2X).  This spool holder pays out filament super smoothly and solves the plastic on plastic squeek/screech the original spool holder exhibits (as the MakerBot tugs on the filament during print jobs).  \r\n\r\nThis spool holder can be easily adapted to use MatterHacker spools, etc."
