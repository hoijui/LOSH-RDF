function = "I created a small light attachment, which is battery operated, and fits into the head of the lamp.\r\n\r\nIf you have an existing printed version of the lamp, you can add this to it, pretty easily.  You may need a dremel tool to extract away a little of the plastic, so you can add the switch and mount the little light. This is what I did."
