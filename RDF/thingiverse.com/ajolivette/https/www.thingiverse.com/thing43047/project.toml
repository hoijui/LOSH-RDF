function = "I made this iPhone 5 case, just like my 4S case, because the cases I downloaded printed too thin, and not exact fits.  This model is a really tight fit for the iPhone, but if you want to print it, go ahead. However, i designed it empty so people can add in their own designs into the center. Whatever they like. Logos, pictures images. Have a blast."
