function = "This is a 3D model i'm building for a game. I built it from a small model. I'll be making the horns, MUCH bigger, changing the colors a bit, animating him to different poses etc. However, this is the first adjustment since the scan. I added the textures on this scan, and I'll just adjust them how I like.  If you download the OBJ, get the MTL and you can get the full textures and be able to do whatever you want with it. If you want to print it, i added the STL and a solid for you."
