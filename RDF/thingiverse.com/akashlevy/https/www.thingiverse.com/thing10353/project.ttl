Didn't want to waste the supports which I thought looked like buildings so I decided to make use of them in scrap city. It's not brilliant, but... creative. By the ways, the red thing is a stadium (it might be a little difficult to tell) and the raft in the middle and the ones at the edges are ponds and parks respectively." ;
