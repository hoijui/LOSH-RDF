function: Well, this is just a city I made from supports and rafts that were produced while printing. Didn't want to waste the supports which I thought looked like buildings so I decided to make use of them in scrap city. It's not brilliant, but... creative. By the ways, the red thing is a stadium (it might be a little difficult to tell) and the raft in the middle and the ones at the edges are ponds and parks respectively.
