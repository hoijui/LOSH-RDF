\r
I have a hexagon shaped tool that was falling through the slots on the tool holder.\r
\r
Designed and printed this to fit (very snuggly) around it and prevent that from happening. \r
\r
I used the code from the Library 'Shapes by Catarina Mota' although I just copied the hexagon and cube sections. Saved me a ton of time!""" ;
