function: "Making this is the essence of having a makerbot (to me). Sure it's fun to print out puzzles and trinkets but when something around the house annoys the @#$@ out of you - you can fix it yourself!\r\n\r\nI have a hexagon shaped tool that was falling through the slots on the tool holder.\r\n\r\nDesigned and printed this to fit (very snuggly) around it and prevent that from happening. \r\n\r\nI used the code from the Library 'Shapes by Catarina Mota' although I just copied the hexagon and cube sections. Saved me a ton of time!"
