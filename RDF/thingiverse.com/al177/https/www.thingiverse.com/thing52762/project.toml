function = "Put a horizontal dowel on a printed case Tantillus for holding loose filament.  \n\nThis takes the place of the spacer washers on the front stiffener just like the side fan mounts.  Any sort of 5/16\" or 8mm rod can be used, but wood dowels seem to be a good option as they're cheap and will probably break before the mount will.  The dowel is friction fit so that it can be easily removed for travel.  \n\nSCAD provided so you can change up the dowel hole size or use it as a base for mounting other stuff to a printed Tantillus."
