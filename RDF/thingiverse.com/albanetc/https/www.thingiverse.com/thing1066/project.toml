It is basically 1\" aluminum Erector set with linear motion extensions. While it's in development and sometimes things don't work as they should, functional robots have been assembled from it: http://contraptor.org/contraptions\r\n\r\nThe set is designed to be made with the simple tools of a basic workshop. A lot of materials for Contraptor like aluminum angle, threaded rods and fasteners can be found in a hardware store. In the spirit of modularity, it uses Makerbot/Reprap electronics and Arduino/Sanguino controller.\r\n\r\nIn addition to DIY plans, we're working on Shopbot-able kits that can be manufactured in small quantities by anyone willing, from open source drawings.\r\n\r\nContraptor components and assemblies are modeled in Sketchup and are hosted on Google 3D Warehouse, mostly for ease of accessing from within Sketchup. Thingiverse is the best place to host DXF/SVG sources and part lists for components, so there will be more Contraptor things coming (hopefully including printed ones from the community :). \r\n\r\nApologies for the long read, on to the thing:\r\n/INTRO\r\n\r\nPerforated angle comes in lengths from 1\" to 24\" and can be used as a structural component, as well as a linear motion rail for sliding elements. Attached DXF file and part list are for 1-ft long perforated angle.\r\n\r\nSketchup source:\r\nhttp://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/search?q=contraptor+angle"
