function = "It\\'s too easy to think that a laser cutter has an infinitely thin beam. It doesn\\'t. Depending on the material, speed, power, we\\'ve found an \\\"effective tool diameter\\\" of 0.002 - 0.008 inches. \r\n\r\nThis hole gauge cuts and labels 100 holes, from 0.050\\\" to 0.149\\\" in a 3 inch square pattern.  When cut into the material you are using it can tell you EXACTLY how large to make body or clearance sizes for various screws and rods, and how large to make tap holes for self tapping.\r\n\r\nThe sizes will cover hardware from 0-80 to 6-32.\r\n\r\nAlden"
