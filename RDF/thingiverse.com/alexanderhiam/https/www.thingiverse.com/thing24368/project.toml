function = "This is a slight modification of elmoray's MakerGear Mosaic simple side mounted cooling fan. I sliced off a corner or two and rotated it, so it should be a bit nicer to print. \r\n\r\nThe print in the images was done from Ultimachine's natural ABS ( http://ultimachine.com/content/abs-175mm-natural-1kg-spool ) with 0.2mm layer height and no support.\r\n\r\nI've included the OpenSCAD file as well as elmoray's original 'Simple Side Mount.stl' which it imports."
