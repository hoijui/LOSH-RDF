function = "This mount allows to mount a small 50x50 mm fan on one of the threaded rods (8mm) of RepRap-like 3D printers.\r\n\r\nYou can adjust fan position and orientation.\r\n\r\nAlso the models are parametric, so you can edit scad file to get exactly what you need.\r\n\r\nI have two fans - one mounted on frame, and one on mounted on carriage (using this mount - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19076). I'm turning on fan mounted on frame manually for models with heavy overhangs or bridges, or when I need to cool form the other side."
