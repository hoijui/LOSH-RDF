function = "I've been loving the joy of a wireless digital weather station that measures wind speed, direction, air pressure, humidity and all that good stuff. Thing was mounted to the shed in the garden.\r\n\r\nDue to an unfortunate flying tent incident last year, the station got ripped off the mounting brackets, so I figured I'd have a bash at designing a new one and printing it with the UP! PP3D that's turning up tomorrow. Designed for a 21mm tube support and there's some ribs in there that should hold it in tight. \r\n\r\nLet's see how it goes."
