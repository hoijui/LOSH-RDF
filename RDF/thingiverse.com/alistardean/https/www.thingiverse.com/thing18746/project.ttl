\r
Due to an unfortunate flying tent incident last year, the station got ripped off the mounting brackets, so I figured I'd have a bash at designing a new one and printing it with the UP! PP3D that's turning up tomorrow. Designed for a 21mm tube support and there's some ribs in there that should hold it in tight. \r
\r
Let's see how it goes.""" ;
