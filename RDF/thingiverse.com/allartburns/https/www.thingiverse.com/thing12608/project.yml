function: "There's been a few tool-holders posted, but they never fit my set of tools.   So I thought, why not make a modular tool rack that hangs off the side of the Cupcake and that people can customize.\r\n\r\nThere are two basic pieces -- \"lip\" and \"nolip\".  The nolip pieces are for lighter objects and fit next the the z-axis parts and rely upon the lip pieces for support.  The lip pieces are for heavier parts and clip onto the side of the makerbot.\r\n\r\nDue to the space between the z-bolts not being a multiple of the z-bolt mounts, there will be a small gap.  If this really, really bothers you, stretch out one of your lip pieces to take up the slack."
