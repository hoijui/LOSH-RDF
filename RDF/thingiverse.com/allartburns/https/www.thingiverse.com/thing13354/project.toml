function = "Working on an air assist for the lasersaur.  Mine is part of a larger design that incorporates exhaust vents at the lower front of the cutting table.  The idea is to suck air out of the lasersaur in the direction away from the laser in order to minimize dust/fumes coating the laser tube or the first 90deg mirror.\r\n\r\nUpdate!  Video of it in action:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/allartburns/6338285065/"
