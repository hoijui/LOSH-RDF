function: Kub Kars (also known as Pinewood Derby)  is a racing event for Cub Scouts. My son drew up some Ferrari style rear fenders that he wanted to make for his this year so we whipped up a quick design. Intended to be sanded and glued before painting the main body, although they would be glued on after if you prefer.
