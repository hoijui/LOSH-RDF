function: "So here is a CAD drawing I did in OpenSCAD of a concept for a ring with a screw-on top.\r\nthe top has a hole in it for an LED. \r\nThere is a side hole in the ring for a mini-usb connector. That needs to be shaped a little more but good enough for now.\r\nNote the top has a cavity to increase the payload space.\r\nTo think about the size of this, the ring will screw onto a 2-litre pop bottle like a bottle top.\r\nso vertically large, but we can overcome that later when we physically prototype."
