function = "Who doesn't hate it when they are mid-brainstorming and all the dry-erase markers have rolled away to some mysterious location?\r\n\r\nThis dry-erase marker holder model provides a simple solution to this problem by holding 3 markers perfectly in place.\r\n\r\nThis holder can be easy attached to any surface with some sticky squares, or is also useful to just leave on the table. Alternatively, you may want to alter the OpenSCAD file to provide a way to bolt this down to make sure no one \"borrows\" it. \r\n\r\nEnjoy the organization and pleasure of never losing your markers again."
