function: "I don't know about you, but one of the hardest things for me about choosing a clock is finding a font I can commit to.\r\n\r\nThanks to my MakerBot, this is never a problem for me, as I can change the color and font of the numbers on my wall clock as often as I want!\r\n\r\nI created this clock by following Tony Buser's 2D to 3D tutorial http://tonybuser.com/2d-to-3d that nicely explains how to export something from Inkscape into a .dxf that OpenSCAD can read."
