function = "A simple holder to hold 3 bottles of essential oil properly in place in the wooden box it was delivered in, instead of the somewhat ugly solution provided by the vendor.\r\n\r\nUploaded a v4 which is 1/2mm larger in diameter. (dcomp in openscad file changed from -2 to -1.5)  because it is _just_ to small for some bottles.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1: fixed scad file\r\nUpdate 2: added second scad file and STL for a holder for 6 pipets"
