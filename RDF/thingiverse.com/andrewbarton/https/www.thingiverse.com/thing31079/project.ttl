    okh:function """This dock is designed specifically for the iPhone 5 and its new lightning connector. This dock is taller than others in order to accommodate the lightning connector's longer stress relief. \r
\r
This dock includes a chamber for weight such as BBs or lead sinkers and a cover which can be glued into place once the weight has been included.\r
\r
This design is parametric, but I designed it in Alibre CAD so it might not be as easy to modify if you don't have the software.\r

10/17/12 update: I published a version of this dock  for phones with a case: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32610""" ;
