function = "After using my Mosaic 1 printer for about 6 months, my filament drive wore out. This was caused by my PTFE filament guide not being aligned perpendicular to the filament drive. Long printing sessions wore a groove into the filament drive and eventually the filament was forced to the side of the drive gear. The symptom of this problem was a slow degradation of grip on the filament resulting in inconsistent printing.\r\n\r\nI tried adding a frame mounted filament guide (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23748), but this was not sufficient to keep the PTFE guide tube straight over the filament drive. \r\n\r\nThis part has solved my problem."
