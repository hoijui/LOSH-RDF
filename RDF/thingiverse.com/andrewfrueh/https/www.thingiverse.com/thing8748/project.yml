function: "This is (yes another) filament spool holder. I decided that I wanted one that was like a little Mendel frame - a nice little triangle.\r\n\r\nIt has a very smooth action and feeds filaments reliably (mine does at least).\r\n\r\nThe frame vertex is based on the Prusa part with an added hole in the middle and slightly thicker. The hub and spokes that hold the spool are of my own design. Enjoy."
