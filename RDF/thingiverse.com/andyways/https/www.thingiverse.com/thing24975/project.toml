function = "This is a slight tweak to David Randolph's excellent 3mm hood and side panels:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23386\r\nThe only major change is that I extended the edges of the 45deg piece so there was less gap between where it meets with the top cut piece and the front cut piece.\r\nIt fits great and there is only just a tiny bit of sagging on the 45deg piece.  David opted to have a gap between these pieces to help dissipate some of the heat."
