\r
My previous method of mounting my Anton Bauer batteries was pretty dismal, so I modeled up this quickly and printed it out. The design worked perfectly and I'm pretty happy with it.\r
\r
Also keep in mind that this entire thing could be designed and printed as a single piece. Since I had the Aluminum rail block already, my design used that. It's very strong.""" ;
