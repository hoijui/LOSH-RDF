function: "I use various cameras for cinema, ENG, documentaries or whatever. One thing remains constant though, I always use my Anton Bauer batteries in favor of proprietary batteries that only work with one camera.\r\n\r\nMy previous method of mounting my Anton Bauer batteries was pretty dismal, so I modeled up this quickly and printed it out. The design worked perfectly and I'm pretty happy with it.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that this entire thing could be designed and printed as a single piece. Since I had the Aluminum rail block already, my design used that. It's very strong."
