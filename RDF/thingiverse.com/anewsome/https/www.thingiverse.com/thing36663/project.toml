function = "I wasn't happy with the cost and limits of existing follow focus systems that are available, so I designed my own follow focus system as part of a larger motion control rig for my various camera systems.\r\n\r\nMy follow focus system uses NEMA 17 stepper motors so I needed a reliable way to mount the stepper motors. I also need to be able to move the system from camera to camera quickly, as well as perform lens changes quickly too.\r\n\r\nSince I've printed a pair of these to use on my rig, they've performed flawlessly. I use one for the zoom gear and one for focus.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty happy with them so I hope you get some use out of them too."
