\r
My follow focus system uses NEMA 17 stepper motors so I needed a reliable way to mount the stepper motors. I also need to be able to move the system from camera to camera quickly, as well as perform lens changes quickly too.\r
\r
Since I've printed a pair of these to use on my rig, they've performed flawlessly. I use one for the zoom gear and one for focus.\r
\r
I'm pretty happy with them so I hope you get some use out of them too.""" ;
