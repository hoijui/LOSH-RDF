function = "Over the summer I purchased a light for my bike. It was probably around $15 and it is the biggest piece of crap ever so I decided to make a better one.\r\n\r\nI looked on here for any workable design that someone else already made but I didn't find one that suited my style. For one, it *has* to be really strong. I don't know how you ride but my bike sees plenty of wheelies, bunny hops and just plain aggressive riding. The light needs to stay put during all that.\r\n\r\nI've tested this one out and it seems to do the job and I think it looks kind of cool. These little LED flashlights are cheap, strong, bright and easy to come by. The design allows you to unscrew the battery cover and swap batteries without removing the unit.\r\n\r\nThis is my first thing I've ever made in OpenSCAD. I'm learning it. I would have posted the scad file but honestly, it's pretty embarrassingÃx82Âxa0and a  bit of a mess. I made an attempt to parameterize it but you could probably break it pretty easy with some whacky parameters. It also takes a really long time to compile and render, 20 minutes or so at $fn = 24."
