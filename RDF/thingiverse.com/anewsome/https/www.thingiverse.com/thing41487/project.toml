function = "After making a delicious pitcher of mudslides the other day, I disassembled the blender pitcher and put all the parts in the dishwasher. I was disappointed to see that the little tabs that held the cap to the lid of the pitcher had broken.\r\n\r\nIt took me a few minutes to think about how to model this in OpenSCAD. It took a few more minutes to actually model it. I wish I could say the same about OpenSCAD compile and render. That took over an hour at $fn = 50.\r\n\r\nThe new cap works and fits very nicely. It prints like a breeze with no issues. I actually think my printed cap is a better fit and a better design than the original. The little nubs I made for locking the cap into the lid are much stronger than the tabs were on the original cap. These nubs will not be breaking off for any reason."
