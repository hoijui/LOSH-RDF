    okh:function """This is yet another type of extruder. I was not not happy with the performance of some of the "pinch wheel" type extruders. I waited to publish until I had gone through an entire 5 lb. spool of ABS and have done so now without any problems.\r
While I don't expect anyone to build this I thought it may inspire new designs based i this direction.  \r
This was designed in alibre and openscad.\r
All files are in the zip file (Warning: File Dump)\r
I am in the process of designing and building my next printer and will have a new model released then.\r
\r
If you have any questions please ask.""" ;
