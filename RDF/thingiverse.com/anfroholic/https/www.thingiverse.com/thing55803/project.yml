function: "This is yet another type of extruder. I was not not happy with the performance of some of the \"pinch wheel\" type extruders. I waited to publish until I had gone through an entire 5 lb. spool of ABS and have done so now without any problems.\r\nWhile I don't expect anyone to build this I thought it may inspire new designs based i this direction.  \r\nThis was designed in alibre and openscad.\r\nAll files are in the zip file (Warning: File Dump)\r\nI am in the process of designing and building my next printer and will have a new model released then.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please ask."
