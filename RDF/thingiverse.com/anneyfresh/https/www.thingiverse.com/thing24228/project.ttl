    okh:function """This puppet was made with my husband Keith Ozar http://www.thingiverse.com/OZAR at the Metropolitan Museum of Art MakerBot Hackathon. We felt so bad for the "Standing Female Deity, possibly Durga" without her arms- now she is definitely Durga!\r
Keith captured the head with 123D catch and \r
I modeled the body and arms in Blender from turnaround photos I took in the gallery. We printed the body on our Thing-O-Matic at home after the first day and printed the head and arms on a Replicator at the event on day 2. It was a whirlwind and I wish the parts fit together a little better, but as my second MakerBot project ever- I think we did a good job. We wanted to share what we accomplished at this awesome event and will continue to refine this! This design is inspired by the old fashioned "Jumping Jack" toy.""" ;
