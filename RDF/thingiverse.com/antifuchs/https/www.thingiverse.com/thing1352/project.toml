function = "This is thingiverse user dom's laptop stand (from this comment: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32#jsid-1237162568-10), with the Hokusai Wave pattern. These are dom's improvements over the original laptop stand design:\r\n\r\n- less sharp edges on the bottom \r\n- slightly longer stands so 15'' notebooks also fit \r\n- a 90 Degree Angle at the holding area, so the notebook has a smoother fit \r\n- also made the holding area slightly deeper for a better fit\r\n\r\nIt fits my 15\" Macbook Pro perfectly (only problem is that I laser-cut the notches too wide; jamming a piece of paper in them fixes this - no more wobbling)."
