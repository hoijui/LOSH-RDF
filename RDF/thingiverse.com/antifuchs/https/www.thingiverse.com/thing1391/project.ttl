    okh:function """I discovered that the first derivate I made of this didn't work perfectly with my Macbook Pro 15": The hinge was hanging a few centimeters out from the far corner, so opening it while in the stand would lift the front of the stand. So this variation features a 30 cm long holding area: This is slightly longer than a 15" Macbook Pro, and should hold a 17" one just as well.\r
\r
It also comes with a cable guide hole, cut to fit underneath the wave. If you want to put the stand up on a desk and leave it there, you now have a way to reduce cable clutter, too.\r
\r
I re-did the shape in qcad and Stefan, an Illustrator master at the Metalab (http://jain7th.soup.io/) helped me make the outlines that mimic the wave a reality.""" ;
