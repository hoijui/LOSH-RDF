function = "This is a pretty generic key fob that can be cut out from Acrylic on a laser cutter, modeled after plastic ones ubiquitous in Austria. It comes with a bit of space in which you can engrave or cut the text/symbols you want.\r\n\r\nIt's 1.5 cm x 5 cm, which should be enough for two lines of readable text, or 2-3 nice and large symbols."
