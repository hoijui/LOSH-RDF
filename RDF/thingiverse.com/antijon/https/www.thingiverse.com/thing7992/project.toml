function = "Practically all SLRs (and many lesser cameras) have a mount at the very top to accept a strobe.  Generally, the camera will ship with a small slip of plastic to slide into the connector, to protect the pins and prevent the connector from accumulating dirt.  However, most people lose it within weeks of taking the camera out of the box.\r\n\r\nThis was just a simple experiment with OpenSCAD and the Thing-O-Matic.  Taking a hot-shoe cover I still had, adding a caliper, and seeing how well I could approximate one made by the original manufacture.  It fits rather snuggly."
