function: "This is a tool for taking pictures for my3dscanner.  This thing consists of rails and a stand.  Print 6 rails for half circle and 12 for 360 degrees.  Assemble the rails like those of children's wooden railroad, insert the stand into the groove, attach the camera to the top of the stand.  Take a picture, and slide the stand with the camera to next position.  My3dscanner recommends 30 pictures for 180 degree project so i have made ticks on the rail for easier positioning.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: this is my first project and this thing is probably not very printable just yet.  I have some ideas how to make the stand more printable by breaking it into parts.  I welcome all comments and advice."
