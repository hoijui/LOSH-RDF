function: Hi everyone, This is my first thing i have uploaded. I designed this scotch tape dispenser for scotch tape that's 50 mm wide. I don't know what the normal width is in the rest of the world, so i have included the google sketchup files. Maybe you can modify this for your needs. I don't have my printer yet, so i don't know how the printer will handle this model
