function = "Designed this fan shroud to combat the issue of my Budaschnozzle hotend not getting enough airflow across the copper heatsink causing a jam when printing with PLA.  This fan shroud is designed to fit between the x-rods and blow directly on the copper heatsink.  Since adding this I have had zero issues."
