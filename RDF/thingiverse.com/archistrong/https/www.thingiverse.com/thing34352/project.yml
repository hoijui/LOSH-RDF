function: "Credit where credit is due, I did not create this model.  I found it on grabcad here (http://grabcad.com/library/switching-power-supply-nes-350) and am posting it at the request of someone on the forum.reprap.org.  Please check out GrabCAD at some point, think of it as a Thingiverso for Solidworks/STEP/STL files of actual objects.  Comes in very handy when you are needing precise measurements for making parts.\r\n\r\nThe ZIP file contains the SolidWorks parts for those interested.\r\n\r\n--updated-- STL file was at the wrong scale.  Should be good now!\r\n\r\nThanks,"
