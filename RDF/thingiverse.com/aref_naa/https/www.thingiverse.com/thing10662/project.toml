function = "While browsing the other day I noticed that there were some pieces for Chinese chess. I've always wanted to own a shogi set, so I spent a couple hours remembering how to do trig, and put a set together from measurements from a Japanese manufacturers' union. Having some trouble with the symbols, though, hence the WIP status. The piece itself prints beautifully, but the piece markings are very low quality. This may turn out better with a smaller extruder nozzle- I'm using .5mm."
