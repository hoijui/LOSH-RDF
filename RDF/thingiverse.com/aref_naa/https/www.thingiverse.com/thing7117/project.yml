function: "I was printing some small but useful things to use up my PLA samples now that my Mendel is operational, and a coworker mentioned he could use a tripod mount for his phone- so I spent a few minutes learning OpenSCAD basics, made a model, and printed it. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, one of the triangular retaining tabs does not print even though it shows up in the model on repraphost- I'd appreciate any tips on making that work right."
