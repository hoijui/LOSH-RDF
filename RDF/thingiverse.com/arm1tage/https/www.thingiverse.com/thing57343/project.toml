function = "Another version of a coin organizer for the car. I made this one before realizing there are many on Thingiverse such as this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9116\r\n\r\nAnyway fits more quarters and has a couple slots for pens or in my case small screwdrivers. Fits perfectly in my MkII Audi TT cupholder."
