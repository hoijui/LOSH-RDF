function: "The ramps board, while compact and reliable (for me so far, knock on wood), is a bit unstable due to it's missing fourth support leg. While you can sneak a screw into the top right corner of the ATMega board, the ramps itself is unsupported, and can become canted, which breaks the connections to the ATMega, and can result in spoiled prints, or worse, disconnected temp sensors).\r\n\r\np.s. This was literally the first thing my reprap ever printed, so please be gentle ;)"
