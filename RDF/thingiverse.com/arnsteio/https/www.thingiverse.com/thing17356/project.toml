function = "This is a pavise as used in Japan during the Sengoku Jidai - the age of the country at war. Pavises were used primarily during sieges, but also figured in some open battles. They were carried by bowmen and arquebusiers alike.  This one carries the Takeda-clan crest on the front, and has a working, hinged support at the back."
