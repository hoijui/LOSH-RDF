function = "Replacement lens cap for Olympus 35 RC Rangefinder, because mine kept falling off. \r\n\r\nThe 35 RC is a rangefinder, and as such can be focussed with the lens cap still attached. Sometimes I am extremely stupid and take photographs without first removing the cap. The rectangular protrusion at the top prevents the focus mechanism from being usable when the lens cap is on by blocking the brightline frame aperture.\r\n\r\nThe circular protrusion can be drilled to accomodate a lanyard which can be attached to the body of the camera."
