function = "Thanks to JP for a nice model of the board. still trying to load the files correctly. Not sure what im doin yet. The board fits in the bottom of the case and lines up on pegs that fit the holes on the arduino. The top has tabs that keep it from moving around once clamped down. Still learning sketchup and im sure theres several mistakes but this sure is fun.Ant ideas for improvement would help. Thanks"
