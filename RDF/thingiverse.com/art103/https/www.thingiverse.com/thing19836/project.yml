function: "The UP! printer that I received did not have the electronic filament feeder, it just had a curved plastic \"shelf\" for the spool to rest on. \r\nThis seemed to have too much friction when printing on the fast setting and was causing the feeder to skip. \r\nI took the bearing designed by chylld, modified it slightly and created my own bearing mount and filament tube guide.\r\nThis works for me and I hope it will help others too."
