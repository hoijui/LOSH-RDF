function: "I had a little extra space on some 1/8th inch plywood I cutting for another project, and decided to cut a copy of Travis77's puzzle [ http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1008 ]\r\n\r\nScaled down for 1/8th inch material thickness, it was just too thin, so I decided to double it up, and added some #4 screw holes to hold it together while I glued the material."
