\r
I really liked the idea of a calendar desk toy, and thought there was something really nice about the idea of building with time, so this construction toy calendar came about.\r
\r
What I really like is that at the end of 2010, there's no need to throw out this calendar. Instead, a new calendar for 2011 (and so forth) can be cut, and used with the previous year's to build bigger and better creations.""" ;
