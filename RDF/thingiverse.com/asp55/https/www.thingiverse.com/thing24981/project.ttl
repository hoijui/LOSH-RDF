    okh:function """I was elated when the Arduino as ISP sketch was released. I spent about a year with a breadboarded version using zif socket and a nest of wires, bypassing the Arduino bootloader and burning my sketches straight to the chip. It didn't take long for this breadboard setup to become a cumbersome chore, so I decided to make a dedicated pcb to handle it.  



The first version had some issues that this one address.   



Improvements include:  

- Place for a resistor to disable auto-reset  

- Large enough holes to use a ZIF socket  

- Option to use either a ceramic resonator OR a crystal  



Credit should go to Evil Mad Scientist's ISP Shield Kit for the idea of using a 100Î© resistor to disable auto-reset.""" ;
