function: "I was elated when the Arduino as ISP sketch was released. I spent about a year with a breadboarded version using zif socket and a nest of wires, bypassing the Arduino bootloader and burning my sketches straight to the chip. It didn't take long for this breadboard setup to become a cumbersome chore, so I decided to make a dedicated pcb to handle it.  \n\n\n\nThe first version had some issues that this one address.   \n\n\n\nImprovements include:  \n\n- Place for a resistor to disable auto-reset  \n\n- Large enough holes to use a ZIF socket  \n\n- Option to use either a ceramic resonator OR a crystal  \n\n\n\nCredit should go to Evil Mad Scientist's ISP Shield Kit for the idea of using a 100\u03A9 resistor to disable auto-reset."
