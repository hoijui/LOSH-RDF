\r
This ISP is based on Using an Arduino as an AVR ISP[http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP].\r
\r
I was elated when the Arduino as ISP sketch was released. I spent about a year with a breadboarded version using zif socket and a nest of wires, bypassing the Arduino bootloader and burning my sketches straight to the chip. It didn't take long for this breadboard setup to become a cumbersome chore, so I decided to make a dedicated pcb to handle it.\r
\r
Some mistakes in this first version: \r
\r
1) Because I'd been using a breadboarded Arduino as my source ISP, I hadn't accounted for auto-reset, so you either have to disable it on the board, or jump the Reset pin to 5V with a 100Î© resistor.\r
\r
2) While I was using a ZIF socket on the breadboard, I didn't use the right component in the PCB design, so the holes were to narrow to use it.\r
\r
These issues were all addressed in v0.2 (now v1.0).""" ;
