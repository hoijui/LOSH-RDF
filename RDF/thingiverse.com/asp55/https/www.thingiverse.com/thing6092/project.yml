function: "It's finally here, the 2011 Hex Desktop Calendar. And just like last year, it's up late!\r\n\r\nThis is a derivative of my 2010 Calendar, which in turn is a derivative of the Hex Connector Toy by 4volt.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n(Full disclosure, the photo is of the 2010 calendar. I still need to cut one.)"
