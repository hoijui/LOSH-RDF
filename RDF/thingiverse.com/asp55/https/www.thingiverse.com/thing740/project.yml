function: "After using the pulley rig I designed here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:566 for a few weeks I realized that the rubber band was clinging & slipping quite a bit. I tried a few different things as a pulley belt, but nothing worked to my satisfaction. So I redesigned it to use a set of gears instead, which totally eliminated the slippage and greatly improved the accuracy.\r\n\r\nOne thing to remember though is that while pulleys move wheels in the same direction, with gears the dimmer will turn in the opposite direction of the servo, so be sure to adjust any code you may have written accordingly."
