function: this is my first attempt at a 3D printable object. It's based on a design (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9710#) I saw at my friend's house. It is a single print that has moving parts. This has now been updated to have much better tolerances between the wheel and the wheel-well. Enjoy :D
