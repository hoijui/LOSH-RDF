function: "This thing is a Derivative of http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-Desk-Top-3-Axis-CNC-Milling-Machine/\r\n\r\nI really wanted a printable cnc machine, there was an incomplete one around but was removed.\r\n\r\nSo I used a frame of my old and poorly made cnc machine i had, and desgined this thing wich so far shows promising results.\r\n\r\nThere are few insprations from prusa, that is the bushing and the anti backlash nut.\r\n\r\nthe new design allows a much bigger build area, the motors got an upgrade so will the drivers.\r\n\r\nas for the z axis im using a big stepper (look like a nema23 but im not sure exacly what is it got it from a printer) with a good lead screw i had around."
