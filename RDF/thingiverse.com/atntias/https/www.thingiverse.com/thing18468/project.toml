function = "Ok so updates, first i have first pcb tests working ! using this method.\r\n\r\ni opened a github project for this here https://github.com/Atntias/probz/commits/master\r\n\r\ni wrote the code as a part of printrun. the code is very messy but its starting to work :).\r\n\r\nim using a dilling head based on the mantis i designed to fit the prusa X carrige, wich i will shortly upload to a thing too.\r\n\r\nThis is based on few ideas i saw online to use and automated process in order to measure distances from head to bed on all the working area. \r\nthen you can take that data and use it to offset gcode accordingly. \r\n \r\nthis is critical for pcb milling, and nice to have in 3D printing, as the whole leveling process becomes not critical as it is. \r\n \r\ngcode offset calculation differs from CMC milling to 3D printing, but im planing on developing both. \r\n \r\ni can probe the surface by replacing the z end stop with 2 wires 1 goes to the aluminum bed and the other to the extruder nozzle/drilling head.\r\n  \r\nvideo of the probing in action http://youtu.be/tKFhiu2a64I \r\n\r\nthe pcb holder you see in the video is another thing il make soon."
