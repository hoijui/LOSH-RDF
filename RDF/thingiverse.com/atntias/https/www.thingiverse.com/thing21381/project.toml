function = "Ok, this replaces the heatsink+aluminum+wooden piece.\r\n\r\non prusa i used a printed part to hold the j head for long time (with cooling). so i figured this should work here too, it has a dual fan mount that give lots of air for both the extruder top and the printed parts.\r\n\r\nthe base part has built it support (0.7 lines designed for 0.35 but should be ok anyways)\r\n\r\nthis should fit jheads but im not sure about makergears since its shorter."
