function: meirm made a burger press to  speed up his burger making.  I like to put a dimple into the center of my burgers so that it doesn't contract and turn into a ball, so I thought I'd add one in. It'll probably need some supports added to print properly.  (The .dxf extrusion is meirm's, but is necessary for the .scad.)
