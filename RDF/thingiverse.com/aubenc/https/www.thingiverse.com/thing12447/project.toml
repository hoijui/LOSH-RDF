function = "Quick, easy and dirty OpenSCAD to make a low poly klein bottle.\r\n\r\nEhem... \r\nQuick? Not as much as I thought (1h-1h30)\r\nEasy? Easy would have been using cylinders $fn=3 instead of polyhedrons!\r\nDirty? Yes! It looks like a parametric thing but it's NOT!\r\nLow Poly? Neither, OpenScad reports 40 faces but there's some misalignment that's adding 4 more than needed."
