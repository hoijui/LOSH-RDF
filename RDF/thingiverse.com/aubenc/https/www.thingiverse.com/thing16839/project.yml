function: "I needed (wanted) a longer handle for this thing so i did it.\r\n\r\nJust a quick OpenSCAD that slices the skaft.stl in three pieces (bottom, middle and top) and then, it puts them back together changing the length of the middle section to fit the length that has been entered as a parameter.\r\n\r\nI tagged this with the \"thing-a-day\" tag... Oups! I was too late to sign-up so, I guess I shouldn't. I have no problem to remove the tag :-( just let me know"
