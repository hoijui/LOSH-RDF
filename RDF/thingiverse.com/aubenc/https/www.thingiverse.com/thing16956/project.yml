function: "A handfull of collets for things 16682 and/or 16890 !\r\n\r\nThe ZIP file contains 48 STL to accomodate the drill bits I use the most.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there's also collets for hex bits, size 6.25mm face to face.\r\n\r\nThey work fairly well, check out the pic with the piece of wood, it's a 15mm thick piece of oak and I have been able to go through it with the 1mm bit ! yes, it took me a while ;-)"
