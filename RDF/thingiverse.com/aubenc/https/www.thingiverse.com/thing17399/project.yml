function: "The rear tire from my son's bycicle was getting flat with apparently no reason. \r\n\r\nI did try to repair it a few times but the solution didn't came until I installed one of these.\r\n\r\nThe STL available to download is for the Schrader tire valve type. Hopefully, the OpenSCAD script can be used to generate caps for other valve types."
