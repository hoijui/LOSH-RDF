function: "Finally here it is: the \xE2\u20AC\u0153Version Zero\xE2\u20AC\x9D of a printed paper windmill. One day I would like to upload another version (you can see it in one of the pictures) but, while it woks, the wings still have too much issues... we'll see.\r\n\r\nThis thing, as provided here requires little wind to start its movement and very little wind to keep on  spinning. It's not made to be efficient but just a toy. Do use the OpenSCAD (good luck) to make it bigger, better, nicer!\r\n\r\nThere are some pictures here: flickr.com/photos/aubenc/sets/72157629199542154/\r\n\r\nAnd (not that) a short video here: youtube.com/watch?v=cjXmF2cNxVg"
