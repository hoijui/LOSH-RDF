function = "A small planetary gears system with a ratio of 4:1 per stage, as many stages as wanted, small, open enclosure to see the gears, and hardware free.\r\n\r\nThe gears are designed with a circular pitch of 2.5mm and they are also slightly beveled at the tips of the teeth to avoid the need of cleaning the excess of material from the firsts layers.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSCAD is not parametric, there's only parameters for clearance (set to 0.2), backslash (set to 0.1), pressure angle (set to 22.5), tolerances between nuts and bolts (set to 0.4) and length of the bolts, sometimes referred as rods. Any other change will not work. \r\n\r\nTo play with the OpenSCAD you will need the following libraries:\r\n\r\nPublic Domain Involute Parameterized Gears by LeemonBaird\r\nthingiverse.com/thing:5505\r\n\r\nPoor man's openscad screw library\r\nthingiverse.com/thing:8796\r\n\r\nKnurled surface finishing library\r\nthingiverse.com/thing:9095\r\n\r\nThe libraries have been included in the ZIP file together with STL files for every single part, build plates for complete sets from 1 to 4 stages, just the crank and upgrade kits from 1 stage to 2, 3 or 4.\r\n\r\n1 minute video: http://youtu.be/MUH0MGP7AGc\r\n\r\nA shorter video (59\") featuring a 10 stages set: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyVZ31tLGCU&feature=plcp\r\n\r\nMore Pics: http://www.flickr.com/photos/aubenc/sets/72157629731990190/"
