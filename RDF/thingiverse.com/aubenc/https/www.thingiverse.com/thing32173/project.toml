function = "A cool pencils pot full of knurls :-)  \n(just another example for the knurl surface library v2)  \nThis thing is big! More than 80mm diameter and 120mm height.  \nThe one I printed (PLA) has a wall thickness of 0.7mm.  \nThe ZIP file contains already compiled pots and test files with a wall thickness from 0.7mm to 1.2mm in 0.1mm increments).  \nDo use the OpenSCAD to change whatever the dimensions you like.  \n\nUPDATE: Added \"solid_pencilsPot.stl\" intended to be printed in \"vase mode\"."
