    okh:function """A handmade voronoid-like pattern designed with dualstrusion in mind... however, the example box(es) here have been made for single extrusion :)\r
\r
I did tried my infamous combination bird-pattern with this (you can see it hiding rear the yellow box in one of the pictures) but... still needs some work before I can (?) upload it.\r
\r
The thing here is "gPattern.scad" (I call it "g" for giraffe) it has 3 usable modules: one to draw the lines, the other to draw the spots and a third one to display some "help" (parameters name and default values).\r
\r
The ZIP file contains boxes which side length ranges from 25mm to 125mm in 25mm increments. The two versions are available (spots and lines).\r
\r
I did find some issues, please find the details in the instructions.""" ;
