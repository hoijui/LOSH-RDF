\r
Inspiration came from those vintage coffee grinders and thus the name.\r
\r
The OpenSCAD code (what a shame!) is included into the ZIP file in the same folder than the single STL files. There's some changes in the code to allow you to see the OpenSCAD views.\r
\r
The "to do" list for this thing is huge but I let it just like this, improvements should come as a derivatives.\r
\r
I post it as a derivative of Public Domain Involute Parameterized Gears by LeemonBaird because I have reproduced (copy and paste and may be... some little change from) most of the code of that thing. \r
\r
It also requires parametric_involute_gear_v5.0.scad by GregFrost which I picked up from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3575\r
\r
And my own Poor man's openscad screw library available at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796""" ;
