    okh:function """Quick'n dirty fan mount for the Replicator Dual.  

Designed for a 40mm fan (the opening is 40.4mm side to side). The long plates (bottom and back) are 1.5mm thick the thickness for other ones (fan casing) is 1.2mm.  

Unfortunatelly, the walls are thin and their thickness is not parametric, they can break easyly: "todo" list.  

I'm using a taped piece of cardboard to close the thing: "todo" list.  

The air exit is big, far from where is supposed to be and it is not ducted, that can have some negative impact: "todo" list.  

And so on, and so on, and so on... for the "todo" list, don't be surprise if there's no much progress in the work for a while, I may even just uncheck the WIP flag and let it like this :-(  

Update:  

I managed to break it so I have add some reinforcement. Also added a couple of little tabs to center the thing and a sort of clip to keep it in place without the need of using tape*.  

(*) Tape is still needed for the cardboard AND I think it's a good idea to use some to secure it, this time I have placed two little pads of thin double-sided tape.  

The STL (v02) differs from the (green) one in the picture (hope it's fine).  

Update 20 May 2014: Added a NOT tested twin fan mount.""" ;
