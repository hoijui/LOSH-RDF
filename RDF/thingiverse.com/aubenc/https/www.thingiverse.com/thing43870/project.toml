function = "The iPod cases I downloaded and tried where not fitting right in my son's iPod so I did this.  \n\nThe patterns I used here can be downloaded in thingiverse.com/thing:33359 and thingiverse.com/thing:22568   \n\nThis thing's OpenSCAD is too dirt and messy to upload it, sorry, just let me know if you would like to risk a headache and I may include it \"as is\".  \n\nFor the logo I used a flatbed scanner and Inkscape to get a couple of DXF that are then used as shown in the OpenSCAD available for download.  \n\nUpdate Aug. 03 2013:  \nUploaded a few test STL to allow a quick print and check and prevent having to waste time and material printing something that doesn't fit right. Thanks a lot to FherraZ for pointing this out!"
