The patterns I used here can be downloaded in thingiverse.com/thing:33359 and thingiverse.com/thing:22568   

This thing's OpenSCAD is too dirt and messy to upload it, sorry, just let me know if you would like to risk a headache and I may include it "as is".  

For the logo I used a flatbed scanner and Inkscape to get a couple of DXF that are then used as shown in the OpenSCAD available for download.  

Update Aug. 03 2013:  
Uploaded a few test STL to allow a quick print and check and prevent having to waste time and material printing something that doesn't fit right. Thanks a lot to FherraZ for pointing this out!""" ;
