function: "Quite a wild test I wrote to try out Taulman's 618 Nylon (I would also love to give it a try using Ultimaker's Flexible PLA).\r\n\r\nI got the Nylon just a couple of hours ago and I still need to tune tons of things, 1st impressions are very promising!\r\n\r\nSome of the pictures show another test printed using PLA as material. In that test the \"slope degrees\" was set to 25degs (65degs overhang) I also got acceptable print quality with 20 degrees.\r\n\r\nI'm trying many (too many) new (to me) things here so I better keep it short. More details in the instructions."
