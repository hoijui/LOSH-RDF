function: "I never dared to upload this thing before :-) but now... ehem... let's keep it like \"I have my reasons\".\r\n\r\nInstead of using this thing, please do consider to use \"real\" bushings or any of the awesome other solutions already available in thingiverse (I do love this one: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4213 by twotimes)\r\n\r\nFor the curious ones, the stock bushings lasted the time to print less than 2lbs of plastic, may be I was not oiling them enough... These emergency ones have printed something close to 10lbs but I'm afraid that they start to ask to be replaced.\r\n\r\nMore pics? http://aubenc.imgur.com/bushings\r\n\r\n(the picture where you can -almost not- see them assembled can be found here http://aubenc.imgur.com/cupcake_cnc_zextender)"
