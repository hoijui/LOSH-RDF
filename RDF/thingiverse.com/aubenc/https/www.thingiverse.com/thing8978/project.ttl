\r
This thing is a derivative of Beautiful Chunky Bracelet by tinkerbelle which has been modified using the poor man's screw library by aubenc.\r
\r
To render (it don't works) or compile (it may take a while) you'll need the library provided in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796.\r
\r
The angle for the thread should be gentle with the arm but still be a perfectly working nut for a bolt with the right dimensions.\r
\r
I have not printed this, I would love to see it printed by someone.\r
\r
Printing tip: Don't be in a hurry. Slow down those wild mm/s and the thread will end up with an outstanding look.""" ;
