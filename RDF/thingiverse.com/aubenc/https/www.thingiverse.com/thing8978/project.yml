function: "When you write \"looks like a nut\" in the description of your thing then somebody can come and \"make it a nut\"... I simply couldn't resist :-)\r\n\r\nThis thing is a derivative of Beautiful Chunky Bracelet by tinkerbelle which has been modified using the poor man's screw library by aubenc.\r\n\r\nTo render (it don't works) or compile (it may take a while) you'll need the library provided in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796.\r\n\r\nThe angle for the thread should be gentle with the arm but still be a perfectly working nut for a bolt with the right dimensions.\r\n\r\nI have not printed this, I would love to see it printed by someone.\r\n\r\nPrinting tip: Don't be in a hurry. Slow down those wild mm/s and the thread will end up with an outstanding look."
