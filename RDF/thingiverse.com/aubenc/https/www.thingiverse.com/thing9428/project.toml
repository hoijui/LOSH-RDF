function = "When I saw http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9383 by PacManFan I remembered that I also was playing a little bit with lead screws, auges, whatever but \"I forgot\" to upload it...\r\n\r\nIt has been hard to find back most of the parts I was printing and using to do those tests and it has been really hard to find the OpenSCAD file that I upload here. I have hundreds of them. \r\n\r\nI've choose this OpenSCAD because is the most complete one and the one that is less hardcoded (but still quite a shame). I've put some effort to clean it here and there but still there's no warranty at all that it will work fine.\r\n\r\nNo warranty neither that the stl provided will fit properly, I think that they should but... who knows????\r\n\r\nThis time I don't have extra pictures to show (my pleasure), instead I have this video... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-4naMl-TOQ\r\n\r\nI just hooked up the motors to bot1334 and ask it to build one stl via RepG.\r\n\r\nThe lead screw provided has a travel per turn of 36mm and I was not modifying the machines.xml to adjust to real sizes."
