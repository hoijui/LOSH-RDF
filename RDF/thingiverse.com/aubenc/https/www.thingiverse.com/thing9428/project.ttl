\r
It has been hard to find back most of the parts I was printing and using to do those tests and it has been really hard to find the OpenSCAD file that I upload here. I have hundreds of them. \r
\r
I've choose this OpenSCAD because is the most complete one and the one that is less hardcoded (but still quite a shame). I've put some effort to clean it here and there but still there's no warranty at all that it will work fine.\r
\r
No warranty neither that the stl provided will fit properly, I think that they should but... who knows????\r
\r
This time I don't have extra pictures to show (my pleasure), instead I have this video... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-4naMl-TOQ\r
\r
I just hooked up the motors to bot1334 and ask it to build one stl via RepG.\r
\r
The lead screw provided has a travel per turn of 36mm and I was not modifying the machines.xml to adjust to real sizes.""" ;
