function = "This is a support for RAMPS 1.4 and arduino on a Mendel Prusa.\r\n\r\nIt locates the whole electronics on the upper section of the printer.\r\n\r\nIt also features the possibility to add a 90mm fan to cool down the stepper drivers as well as a central filament guide.\r\n\r\nThe original model was printed in ABS with a 0.20mm layer height. Takes about 3h30 to print.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The support for the fan has to be treated gently. I will reinforce the columns in a future revision."
