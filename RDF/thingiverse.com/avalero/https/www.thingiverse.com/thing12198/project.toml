function = "This is a printable parametric Castor Wheel. It is formed by two parts that must be printed independently: support and wheel. The wheels is supposed to have an O-Ring to track well. \r\n\r\nThis Object has been designed with http://iearobotics.com/oomlwiki/ - OOML (The C++ Object Oriented Mechanics Library) version 0.45.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OOML is a set of tools written in C++ that allow designers to create mechanical parts using the C++ language. OOML applies the model of Object Oriented Programming to Mechanical Designs. Parts can be inherited from others. A part can join together other existing parts, and so forth. It generates OpenSCAD code that can be modified and used to generate the STL files."
