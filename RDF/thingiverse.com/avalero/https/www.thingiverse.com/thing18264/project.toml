The diameter of the wheel is typical in Spain (16mm aprox). For different diameters you can easily change the cpp code of the Part.\r\n\r\nFirst Motion Test: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n87DS0lhV8\r\n\r\nThe ProtoBOT has been designed by:\r\n\r\nMario Almagro: http://www.thingiverse.com/mario_al\r\nNieves Cubo: http://www.thingiverse.com/nicuma\r\nAlberto Valero: http://www.thingiverse.com/avalero"
