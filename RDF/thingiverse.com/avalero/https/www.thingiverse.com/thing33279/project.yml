function: "(Updated 3 March 2013)\r\n\r\nThis is a lm8uu bearing holder for the y axis of a Mendel, Prusa, or Air 2 reprap printer.\r\n\r\nIt is inspired by Jonas Kuheling holder, which fixes the bearin with screw and nut but is designed to be printed horizontally, so that it does not break when tightening the screw.\r\n\r\nI have tried to break it and I have not been able (with a bearing inside)"
