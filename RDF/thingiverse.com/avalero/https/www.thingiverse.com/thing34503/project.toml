function = "This is the famous Jonas Kuehling extruder adapted for the RepRapWorld.com pneufit. For Bowden Extrusion.\r\n\r\nI have just added this configuration to the Jonas' scad files.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the multiXtruder project (http://iearobotics.com/multixtruder - Spanish) . It aims to place up to 3 hot-ends on a Prusa i3. The goal is not printing with all three at the same time but to be able to choose one or two depending on the part. This can be useful when the nozzle diameter is different for each hot end."
