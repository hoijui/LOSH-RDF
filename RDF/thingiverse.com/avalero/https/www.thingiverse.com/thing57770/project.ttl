\r
This part is printed standing up, so it is very (really very) difficult to break. \r
\r
The internal diameter is slightly smaller than the bearing diameter, so it will remain quite tight. I recommend to print with ABS, which is elastic enough and will remain quite strong. Maybe PLA is not enough elastic.\r
\r
It has very small clearance, so it fits the Prusa i3 frame (the version with bushings on the y axis).\r
\r
Design is parametric. It can be easily changed to LM10uu or other linear bearings.""" ;
