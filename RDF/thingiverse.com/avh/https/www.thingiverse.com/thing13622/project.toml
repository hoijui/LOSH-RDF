function = "This thingy is a replacement body for your arducopter. It hides the electronic speed controls,  power distribution panel, and a ton of wires inside. It is really strong, and it makes your copter look bad ass.\r\n\r\nThe design features attachment points for battery strap, bolt holes for attaching the arms, vents for the ESCs, cable holes big enough to fit the battery cable with connector.\r\n\r\nI would love some suggestions for attachments. I'm planning to add some kind of cover for the electronics."
