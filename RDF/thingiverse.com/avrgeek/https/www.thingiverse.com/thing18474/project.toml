He'll feel just like Lassie! \r\n\r\nUse the GPS on the phone to track your dog's movement. Never worry about losing your pet again.\r\n\r\nMount the phone backwards and engage the camera for a dog's eye view of the world.\r\n\r\nStop yelling yourself hoarse calling for your dog. Simply pre-record all commands into the phone and trigger them remotely.\r\n\r\nSecure sponsorships and play advertisements on the phone wherever your dog goes. Isn't it about time Fido stopped being such a freeloader and paid for his own food?"
