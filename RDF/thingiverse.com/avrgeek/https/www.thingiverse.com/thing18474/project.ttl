The iWoof has many useful and entertaining applications:\r
\r
\r
Display your dog's name in style with lighting and animation.\r
\r
Give your dog a personal soundtrack. He'll feel just like Lassie! \r
\r
Use the GPS on the phone to track your dog's movement. Never worry about losing your pet again.\r
\r
Mount the phone backwards and engage the camera for a dog's eye view of the world.\r
\r
Stop yelling yourself hoarse calling for your dog. Simply pre-record all commands into the phone and trigger them remotely.\r
\r
Secure sponsorships and play advertisements on the phone wherever your dog goes. Isn't it about time Fido stopped being such a freeloader and paid for his own food?""" ;
