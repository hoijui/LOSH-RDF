function: "Fido will be rocking his own iPhone in no time.\r\nThe iWoof has many useful and entertaining applications:\r\n\r\n\r\nDisplay your dog's name in style with lighting and animation.\r\n\r\nGive your dog a personal soundtrack. He'll feel just like Lassie! \r\n\r\nUse the GPS on the phone to track your dog's movement. Never worry about losing your pet again.\r\n\r\nMount the phone backwards and engage the camera for a dog's eye view of the world.\r\n\r\nStop yelling yourself hoarse calling for your dog. Simply pre-record all commands into the phone and trigger them remotely.\r\n\r\nSecure sponsorships and play advertisements on the phone wherever your dog goes. Isn't it about time Fido stopped being such a freeloader and paid for his own food?"
