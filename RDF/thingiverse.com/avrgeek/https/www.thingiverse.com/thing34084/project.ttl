This design was used to print the engagement ring for my then-girlfriend, but now-fiance.  I can attest to the effectiveness of this design :)  Several revisions were printed in several plastics from Shapeways.  Frosted detail probably was the most impressive plastic version due to a slight transparency.  White strong and flexible worked, but did not reproduce the engravings well.  The silver print from Shapeways came out very well.""" ;
