function = "Physical representations of particular thicknesses are helpful during designs.  This is a simple project to generate blocks of a particular thickness.  A designer can have an idea of the look, feel, and structure at various values.  The included STL contains prime values from 1-11.\r\n\r\nThe openscad file is full parametric, so different values can be used for experimentation.  Make sure that bitmap.scad is available for the text to generate properly (Thanks tbuser!  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2054)"
