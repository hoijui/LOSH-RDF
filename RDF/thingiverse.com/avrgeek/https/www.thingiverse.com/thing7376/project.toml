function = "Some cars come with removable cup holders.  While this is great for cleaning, it is not so great if one is lost.  This is a replacement for such a holder.  The STLs are modeled for a 2005 Ford Focus.  Parametric values in the OpenSCAD file can be adjusted for other vehicles with a similar design.\r\n\r\nNote: The original required a bit of sanding to fit, so the uploaded version has been reduced by several mm."
