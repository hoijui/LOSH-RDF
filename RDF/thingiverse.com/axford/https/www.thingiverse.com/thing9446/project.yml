function: "Inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9006, this is an attempt to create a parametric loc-line compatible 1/4\" hose segment using OpenSCAD.  \r\n\r\nFor now I've only modeled a single segment, but plan to add accessories in the future (nozzles, mounting base, etc)\r\n\r\nDescription of Files\r\n- The DWG contains my dimensioned reference design\r\n- The DXF contains a cross-section ready for lathing\r\n- \"modular_hose_segment_from_dxf.scad\" is a one-line OpenSCAD script to lathe the DXF into a solid (using rotate_extrude)\r\n- \"modular_hose_segment.scad\" is the main parametric script\r\n- \"modular_hose_segment.stl\" is a high-resolution STL export from the OpenSCAD script\r\n\r\n\r\nTweaking the script\r\nThere are loads of variables in the script to play with, hopefully they are all fairly self explanatory.  I suspect the two most useful (in terms of tweaking the design for printing) will be:\r\n- tolerance = controls the distance between the ball and socket surfaces\r\n- definition = this defines the number of facets for curved surfaces (sets the $fn parameter)\r\n\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\nThis is my first practical OpenSCAD design, so would welcome any feedback on how to refine either the object or my OpenSCAD coding style.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates\r\nI've now merged this into a more comprehensive modular hose library - see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9457"
