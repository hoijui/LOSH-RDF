function = "Standing on the amazing work of http://www.thingiverse.com/jrombousky and http://www.thingiverse.com/rmadams, I wanted a version of the male buckle that has the adjustable strap mechanism and a middle prong to make clipping this together even easier.\r\n\r\nNote that you will need one of jrombousky's original female buckle sleeves to clip into found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1272\r\n\r\nI included all the revisions I made to this point, including notes about the problems of each. Only rev5 is worth printing, but they are there if you want to hack them. We need to take the adjustable strap end of this file and slap it on the female sleeve for sew-free buckling."
