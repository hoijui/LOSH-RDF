function = "A replacement for the \"Cook Time\" knob on our KitchenAid toaster oven. While not 100% the same as the original knob, you can't really tell the difference between it and the others unless you look (except for the fact that I printed it a different color).\r\n\r\nThe knob should fit on any standard .237\" (6mm) shaft with flat edge.\r\n\r\nPlease give feedback if you have any....I'm open to suggestions if you would like anything modified. And feel free to click \"Made One\" If you did, I would love to see my design being used :)"
