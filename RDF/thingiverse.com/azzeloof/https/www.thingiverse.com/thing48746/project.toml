function = "A Velcro car dock for use with any phone. The mount is attached to your dashboard via Velcro, and the phone is attached to the mount via Velcro on the case or phone back. This lets you use the mount with any phone, regardless of its size.\r\nThe Velcro also allows you to adjust the mount once it is installed (though there are also screw holes, so you can attach it permanently if you wish).\r\n\r\nThis design is heavily based off of (read: the CAD files are identical) Brandon W6's design (see project ancestry).\r\n\r\nAnd, or course, don't operate your phone while driving, and I'm not responsible if you do and you (or somebody else) get(s) hurt as a result."
