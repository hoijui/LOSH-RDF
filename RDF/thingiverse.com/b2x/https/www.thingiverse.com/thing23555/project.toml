function = "This is a modified version of Greg Frost's X-carriage for a Prusa Mendel.\r\n\r\nIn this version, there are 2 lm8uu holders on the motor side, with 1 holder on the othe rod. This produces more stability when moving the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe original fan holder is still there, with holes for another fan holder on the side oposite the belt.  This allows for two fans, one for cooling the hot-end, and the other for cooling the PLA piece that is being printed.\r\n\r\nHere is a bed fan mount for ducting air directly to the printed piece. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23713"
