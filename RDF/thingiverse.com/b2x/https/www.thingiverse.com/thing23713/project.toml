function = "This fan mount will duct a 40mm fan to your bed.  Made for a Prusa and mounts to this x-carriage: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23555\r\n\r\nOne of the images shows the right-side of the bed fan.  You can see that the mirrored x-carriage can hold two fans, one for the bed and one for the hot-end.\r\n\r\nThe scad file is attached.  Feel free to change and reuse however you want.  I'm thinking at some point I may modify it with some mounts for LEDs to make viewing the printing part easier."
