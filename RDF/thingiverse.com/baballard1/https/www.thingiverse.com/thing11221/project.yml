function: After a buddy of mine had a few accidents with indoor Quadcopter flights we ran out of all of our spare motor mounts, so we started printing them off of thingiverse. We found that the bolt holes on the parts weren't a perfect match for the originals so decided to design our own.  Included are both A and B parts along with the original .SLDPRT files in case you have access to Solidworks or a higher-end 3D printer.
