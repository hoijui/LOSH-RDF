function: "I'm not sure how well everyone's clamps for holding the X belt to the X carriage have held up, but mine slowly but surely degraded to the point it wouldn't hold the belt anymore without loosening up significantly about 45 mins into a print. Yeah, I could have printed spares, but it was even warping the x carriage itself :(\r\n\r\nSo, for those of you who are still rocking the old school x carriage, here is an alternate x belt holder that should work fine or at least hold you over until you can print some newer parts.\r\n\r\nI've been printing with it for about 10-15 hours and it's still going strong so you shouldn't have any issues with it."
