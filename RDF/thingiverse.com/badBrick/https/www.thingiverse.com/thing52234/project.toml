function = "Fits 1 (one)  16x2 LCD in a 5x2x12 Brick.  This mount is intended to basically hold up a 16x2 LCD for prototyping some ideas.\r\n\r\nThe brick itself is equal to 5 (2x12) Lego bricks. So it can be \"bricked\" into a nice support structure to hold it in place.\r\n\r\nA huge help when you are trying to make something and don't want your LCD out and loose."
