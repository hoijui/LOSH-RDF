function: "Fits 1 (one)  PIR sensor in a 5x2x6 Brick.  This mount is intended to hold up a PIR Sensor for prototyping some ideas.\r\n\r\nThe brick itself is equal to 5 (2x6) Lego bricks. So it can be \"bricked\" into a nice support structure to hold it in place.\r\n\r\nA huge help when you are trying to make something and don't want your sensors out and loose. That can cause shorts, pulled wires, and or just slow you down.\r\n\r\nThis brick was specifically designed to hold the PIR sensor that we buy from Adafruit\r\n\r\nThis is NOT totally compatible with the PARALLAX PIR sensor..  Yet.. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can just drill a hole to make space where the Jumper on the face of the Parallax PIR is."
