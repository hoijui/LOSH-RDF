function = "Fits 1 (one)  Maxbotix LV-EZx in a 3x2x4 Brick.  This mount is intended to basically hold up a MaxSonar LV-EZ0 Range Finder Sonar for prototyping some ideas.\r\n\r\nThe brick itself is equal to 3 (2x4) Lego bricks. So it can be \"bricked\" into a nice support structure to hold it in place.\r\n\r\nA huge help when you are trying to make something and don't want your sensors out and loose. That can cause shorts, pulled wires, and or just slow you down.\r\n\r\nIt should be compatible with All \"EZ\" series."
