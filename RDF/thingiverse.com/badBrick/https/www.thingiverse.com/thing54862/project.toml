function = "Fits 1 (one)  Maxbotix LV-EZ(x) in a Hollow flexible mount Brick with a 2 Segment extension tube.  This mount is intended to basically hold up a MaxSonar LV-EZ0 Range Finder Sonar for prototyping some ideas.\r\n\r\nThe base mount brick itself is equal to 3 (2x4) Lego bricks that can be \"bricked\" into a nice support structure to hold it in place. Then the end mount that holds the sensor can be positioned in any direction. The wires from the end mount are then able to be threaded through the tube and through the base Brick.\r\n\r\nIt should be compatible with All \"EZ\" series.\r\n\r\nThis Kit Includes:\r\n\r\n1.  FlexSegBase2 -  Ultrasonic Base Mount Brick with Flex Mount Tube Nib.\r\n\r\n2.  (2)  FlexSeg_WN2 -  Flex Tube Segments.\r\n\r\n3.  FlexSeg_MountBak2  - Flex Segment Mount Back Clip and Tube Nib. \r\n\r\n4. FlexSeg_MountFace - Front Mount Brick that Clips to Mount Back and holds the Sensor.\r\n\r\nActually this is \"2\" things..  You can just print the bbFlexSeg_WN2 if you just want a flexible tube.."
