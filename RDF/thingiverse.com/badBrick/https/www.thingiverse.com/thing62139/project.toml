This mount is intended to hold Arduino Uno R3 for prototyping some ideas.  \n\nThe brick mount itself can be stand alone or mounted, so it can be \"bricked\" into a nice support structure to hold it in place.  \n\nIf you don't have a 3D printer but you're interested in getting one of these we can print you one at badbrick.com/catalog"
