function: "This car model is loosely based on a mercedes C9 le man car.\r\n\r\nThe model was split in half as it prints better this way. Unfortunately on my set up it warped quite badly and so it could do with some tweaking. \r\n\r\nThe model is pictured in two halves but can be glued together on an unwarped print.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded a step. file for anyone who would like to edit the model.\r\n\r\nUPDATE1- I've added two more files, an stl and stp of 'car thingi whole'. This is the same model which will probably require support material but you won't need to glue the two halves together. Thanks for the suggestion jfpion.\r\n\r\nPlease upload a photo if you print one :)"
