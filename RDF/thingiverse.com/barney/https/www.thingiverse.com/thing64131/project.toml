function = "Professor Bot and his team of makers have recently relocated to the Robolabs moon base to continue development of their unparalleled robot building technology away from the threat of the dangerous Dr. Warp.  \n\nDisaster struck however when one of Dr. Warp's minions hacked into the RoboLabs mainframe and stole Professor Bot's Lunar Elite technology! This could prove catastrophic if the evil Dr. uses it to replicate a robot army.  \n\nProfessor Bot must now rely on Vertex, his finest creation to retrieve the plans for Lunar Elite before it's too late...  \n\nUPDATE - I've uploaded a new version with completely redesigned joints which are much improved -  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:69329"
