function = "A member of my family showed me a trophy he had been given by a colleague, after this colleague had told him he would [proverbially] eat his hat if they achieved this work objective. The trophy was a top hat with a bit out of it on a small plinth. My family member wanted to give something similar to someone else, and having unsuccessfully trawled the internet looking for it, he asked me to create him one. This model is the result.\r\n\r\nThus I cannot claim the idea to be an original one of my own, but have tried unsuccessfully to find whoever had it in the first place. The model is created by me however."
