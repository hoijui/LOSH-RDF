The trophy was a top hat with a bit out of it on a small plinth. My family member wanted to give something similar to someone else, and having unsuccessfully trawled the internet looking for it, he asked me to create him one. This model is the result.\r
\r
Thus I cannot claim the idea to be an original one of my own, but have tried unsuccessfully to find whoever had it in the first place. The model is created by me however.""" ;
