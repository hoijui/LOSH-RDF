function: "By way of teaching myself SCAD for the Customizer competition, I set myself a challenge to reproduce Makerbot's IPhone cover, without cheating and looking at their code! This is the result. If anyone else is trying to learn SCAD I found this a very helpful approach.\r\n\r\nThere are a few modifications from the original version. The edges are more rounded, and there are small radii on the edge breaks for the buttons etc.\r\n\r\nNOTE 11/03/2013:\r\nFor some reason the stl file generated seems to be removing the pattern now, despite it being visible on the previewer. I will look at this as soon as I get a chance - or if anyone has any ideas why please let me know!"
