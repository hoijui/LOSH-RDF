function = "Inspired by Thing-O-Fun's \"Functional Differential Gear System\" I decided i should make one for my RC car. So i did.\r\n\r\nI scaled down the gears from the above mentioned Thing, and designed the rest of the parts in my favourite cad software.\r\n\r\nAnd it works surprisingly well, my car is 4WD so i have two of these in the car right now!"
