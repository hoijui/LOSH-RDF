function: "I needed to make something to get my car moving on the snow! So as a test i made these wheels for fun.   \n\n\n\nI only have a touring car with a low ground clearance which might not be ideal for this kind of driving but as i had nothing else i might as well give it a try.   \n\nIt worked quite well and i had alot of fun testdriving them!   \n\n\n\nUpdate 1: Added new version (A.7) with better center support.  \n\nVideo of wheels breaking: http://youtu.be/2yW74kWtUmA  \n\n\n\nI will add another video of the updated wheels later.  \n\n\n\nUpdate 2: As \"DaleDunn\" suggested i have added a \"Herringbone style\" version. Left and right. Haven\xC2\xB4t printed them yet though.  \n\n\n\nJoin the OpenRC discussion at: https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/112745535856143176146  \n* * *  \n##By Daniel Nor\xE9e  \n[Home](http://danielnoree.com) - [Things](http://www.thingiverse.com/barspin/designs) - [GooglePlus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DanielNoree) - [Twitter](http://twitter.com/DanielNoree) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/daniel.noree) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/DanielNoree2) - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/danielnoree/) - [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user13823588/videos) - [LinkedIn](https://se.linkedin.com/in/danielnoree)"
