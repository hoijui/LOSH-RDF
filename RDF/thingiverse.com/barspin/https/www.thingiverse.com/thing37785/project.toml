Now, i canÃx83Âx82Ãx82Â´t print rubber and i realise that a tire printed in ABS wonÃx83Âx82Ãx82Â´t have much success on the street outside my home unless maybe for drifting?\r\n\r\nBut what if i did something like on this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:37131 only with a design that would be smaller and better suited for gravel and sand? Should work right?\r\n\r\nSo i just decided to print the wheels just to get a feel for if maybe it would work... just for fun as always ;-)\r\n\r\nIts designed to be printed using dualstrusion.\r\n\r\nJoin the OpenRC discussion: https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/112745535856143176146"
