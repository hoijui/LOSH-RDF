\r
Modified Berend's Ultimaker Ducted Cooling Fan such that the really long screws on the extruder head can screw directly into the duct's roof (as opposed to replacing the screws with even longer screws as in Berend's design).\r
\r
It was specifically designed to be printed without a fan and, thus, is dead simple in design.\r
\r
It can be held together with hot glue.""" ;
