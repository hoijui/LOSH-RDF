function = "This a Teensy based IR blaster that lets you control most IR receiving devices from a computer via a serial port (emulated over USB by the Teensy).\r\n\r\nPrint the lid using transparent filament so you can see the cool glow of the on-board LED!\r\n\r\nSee for details:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.friday.com/bbum/2012/03/17/teensy-based-ir-blaster/\r\n\r\nI don't like the long spur on the front of the top part of the case.  It doesn't print well.    As the overhang isn't that great, printing a simple hole on the front of the case would like be a better alternative.\r\n\r\nModeled with ViaCAD;  files included.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  Added \"Simple\" variants;  the simple variant includes a tighter, simpler, lid without a long tab and the box has a simple LED hole instead of the slot.\r\n\r\nUPDATE2: Even more simple;  I discovered that the IR LED is powerful enough that it can broadcast through the translucent filament material without issue.   Thus, no more hole needed for the LED!"
