\r
Print the lid using transparent filament so you can see the cool glow of the on-board LED!\r

\r
I don't like the long spur on the front of the top part of the case.  It doesn't print well.    As the overhang isn't that great, printing a simple hole on the front of the case would like be a better alternative.\r
\r
Modeled with ViaCAD;  files included.\r
\r
UPDATE:  Added "Simple" variants;  the simple variant includes a tighter, simpler, lid without a long tab and the box has a simple LED hole instead of the slot.\r
\r
UPDATE2: Even more simple;  I discovered that the IR LED is powerful enough that it can broadcast through the translucent filament material without issue.   Thus, no more hole needed for the LED!""" ;
