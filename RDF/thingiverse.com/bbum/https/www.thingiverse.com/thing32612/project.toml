function = "A spacer piece that allows fan ducts designed to be mounted to the bottom of the aluminum plate on an Ultimaker with a v1 extruder to be used with a v2 extruder.   Should work well with most ducts, but was designed for the one pictured.\r\n\r\nHas added advantage in that it seems to better isolate the duct from any heat related deformation over time.\r\n\r\nI should have printed it in a different color than the duct;   it is the extra yellow plate bit at the top."
