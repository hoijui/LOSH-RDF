function: "(Note, someone else pulled together a really nice replacement cup here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1863728 Consider using it instead.  It is a much cleaner design!)\r\n\r\nI'm gradually transitioning from the Aerogarden based hydroponic/aeroponic based gardening system to building my own.  The first step was to replace the Aeroponic grow pods with larger pods that provide for more root growth and can be used with \"rockwool\" or other similar growing medium.\r\n\r\nThese pods are a better design than the original.   First, they are larger and more stable.  Secondly, the notched side slides down where the little water drain is on each grow pod hole.  This improves the water flow significantly.\r\n\r\nCovers provided, too.  Useful during sprouting, but not necessary.\r\n\r\nNote that the attached ViaCAD model file is, frankly, awful.  I didn't know what I was doing when I made it (was one of my first models) and it is more sculpted than modeled.   Someday, I'll remake it with Inventor Fusion (or OpenSCAD)."
