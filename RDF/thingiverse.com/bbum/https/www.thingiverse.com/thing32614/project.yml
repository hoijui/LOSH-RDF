function: "My son has taken up sorting all of my various fasteners (and finding new ones *everywhere*), but ran out of drawer dividers to corral his sorting efforts.\r\n\r\nI wasn't quite happy with the various parametric solutions, so I threw together a simple drawer divider in Inventor Fusion.\r\n\r\nWorks in 25x51mm drawers (which are quite common)."
