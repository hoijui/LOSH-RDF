function = "This mount goes on the left side of your Prusa on what ever excess threaded rod you have hanging oout. This is a great spot because you can point it at your controller, Y motor, X motor, or your print bed. If you don't have one yet and you like it, I got mine at Best Buy but I'm sure you can find it just about anywhere else."
