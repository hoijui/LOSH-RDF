function = "This is the Quantum ORD Bot.  It is 3D printer mech platform made from MakerSlide linear bearing.  It is extremly ridged and very easy to build.  The design can easily be scaled in X,Y and/or Z by simply changing the Makerslide lengths plus belt and leadscrew lengths.  This is the mini or 'Quantum' version.  The parts other than MakerSlide are either off the shelf standard items or easily fabricate with a laser cutter, 3D printer or CNC router.  There is a blog post giving a lot more detail.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.buildlog.net/blog/2012/01/the-quantum-ord-bot/\r\n\r\nAs a reference point, this size uses less than $15 worth of Makerslide extrusion.  You also need about $45 worth of MakerSlide wheels, spacers, etc.  The Makerslide parts are available at the MakerSlide store.  Be aware the rail is released in weekly 'production batches' and sells out very quickly.  It is 'restocked' on weekly basis. \r\n\r\nI have attached the complete 3D design in STEP format plus a DXF of the flat parts.  If I can generate enough interest, I may have about 50 sets of parts fabricated and offer kits.  That would be for the mechatronics platform only.  The extruder, electronics, etc would not be included.\r\n\r\nWhy spend $200 for a set of printed parts when you can have everything you see here, including motors, belts, pulleys for about $200?\r\n\r\nPlanned changes.  \r\n1.  I plan to change the crossbar handle thing to an extrusion to make it more scalable.\r\n2.  The 'quantum' design currently uses NEMA14 motors.  I plan to tweak the parts to be compatible with NEMA17.  This just adds a second pattern to some parts."
