function = "I made these corner blocks for Misumi 20mm x 20mm extrusion.  Misumi sells similar blocks but they are close to $6 each and I need a lot of them.  I also designed it to have one screw compress the layers to make them a little stronger.  \r\n\r\nThis type of corner block allows you to use the slots for acrylic panels.\r\n\r\nThere are three versions.  A standard corner and two corners (left and right hand) that act as feet.\r\n\r\nI used them to make a nearly air tight spool holder.  The extra parts for that are here too."
