function: "OK...that is a lie.  It is a 3D printer \"themed\" longboard.  The filament is rubber oring glued into grooves.  The grooves are only one radius deep so the rubber oring acts as grip lines.  It looks and feels really cool.\r\n\r\nAs soon as spring arrives, I'll get some trucks and wheels."
