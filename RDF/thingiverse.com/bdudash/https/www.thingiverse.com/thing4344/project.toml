function = "I had been using a variant on the original mendel hot end ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2018 ) and was constantly getting heat transfer up to my (sadly) PLA printed extruder parts.  These parts were actually deforming a little under the heat.  So I redesigned to fit my needs.\r\n\r\nThis is a new hotend design borrowing from from makerbot's MK5 extruder (see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3290 ).\r\n\r\nIt has a nicrome wrapper cylindrical solid aluminum core and fits into a PTFE sleeve at the top which allows it to be used with the original mendel X carriage.  Additionally it can be used with the MOSFETs on the mendel extruder controller board and doesn't require large clicky relays. ;)\r\n\r\nIt makes use of the MK5 nozzle and thermal barrier tube that you can get easily from Makerbot Industries storefront."
