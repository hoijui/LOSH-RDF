function: "This is a mouthpiece for a trumpet. I designed it with the idea that mouthpieces are expensive and with a 3D printer you can make any type you want for about a buck.\r\n\r\nI designed the openSCAD file to be easy to modify. It should be pretty self explanatory. It has a list of the points that make up the side view of the mouthpiece. This makes it fairly easy to add in new types of mouthpieces.\r\n\r\nSo far I have only made 3 types of mouthpieces, but I plan to make more soon. 2 of the mouthpieces are from Marcinkiewicz (the 4/7c and the 3/5c). The other is from Bach (the 3C). You can see information on the Marcinkiewicz mouthpieces and their other trumpet mouthpieces here: http://www.marcinkiewicz.com/mouthpieces/trumpet/standard.htm\r\nFor information on the Bach mouthpiece see the PDF here: http://www.bachbrass.com/mouthpieces/\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is still very experimental. It might not work well as a mouthpiece because of certain technical problems with 3D printing.\r\n\r\n* New in v1.1 - Optional Inverting of the mouthpiece for easier printing on a Makerbot or RepRap. Optional Add of support structures to allow small layers to cool enough when printing.\r\n\r\n** I\\'m currently working on instructions for the best way to print this on a Makerbot or a RepRap. Right now just experiment until you get the best results. If you have any tips for good settings for printing, post them here. **"
