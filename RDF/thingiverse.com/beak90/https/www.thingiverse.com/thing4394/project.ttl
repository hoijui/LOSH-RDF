    okh:function """I wanted to explore the frontier of frosting extrusion, but I didn\\'t have the money for a Makerbot Frostruder and an air compressor. So instead of buying one, I designed one. Chooch\\'s design is nice, but it has too many printed parts and it doesn\\'t use the standard 60cc syringe. The only way I could use the Makerbot 60cc syringe was to design a new mount.\r
\r
For less than the price of a Makerbot Frostruder you can make my printed Frostruder and buy an air compressor. The design consists of a syringe mount and a syringe. Part of the mount is thing #1912 so you\\'ll need to print that as well as the files in this thing.\r
\r
Although the mount is important, the real innovation here is the printable syringe. I\\'m not sure what the volume of it is, but it\\'s enough for some light testing. You\\'ll need a 1/8\\" NPT tap to tap the plastic to connect the tube connector.\r
\r
Keep in mind that this is a very experimental design. It actually works quite well, but some of the tolerances in the parts are slightly off so you might need to use some force to connect stuff together.""" ;
