\r
This is a simplified version of thing #4824. I took out the stem of it so the stepper hangs off the other side of the extruder. This means you only need one extra 606 bearing. It also means a lot less wasted plastic.\r
Also, instead of a NEMA 17 mount, I changed the mounting pattern to be for the Kysan gearmotor so that you can use this upgrade on a MK3, MK4, MK5, or Brutstruder. I will be using this with a Brutstruder so that's the main thing I'm designing this for. There actually probably won't be enough clearance to use this with a MK4 so I'm going to recommend using this with a Brut or MK5.""" ;
