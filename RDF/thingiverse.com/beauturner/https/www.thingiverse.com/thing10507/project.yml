function: "For use in bathrooms that have a 1\" square bar, typically turned to show a diamond shape (to shed water). The ends that connect the bar to the wall are typically secured in place and not removable. This design provides an attachment point for common bathroom accessories from the hook end.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Tweak to the support structure and slightly smaller 13/16\" vs. 1\" in version 2.\r\n\r\nThe top end will wrap the bar and snap into place, using a small amount of flexibility in the ABS. \r\n\r\nThis has been printed and used successfully with ABS and 30% infill, adjust as needed. :)"
