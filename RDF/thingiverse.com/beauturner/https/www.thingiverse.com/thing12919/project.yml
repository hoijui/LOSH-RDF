function: "Working on a sailboat and the original curtains disintegrated, so we made new curtains and had to have some way to hang them. There was an existing T-Track that was used, from an unknown manufacturer. So armed with a handy caliper and a few measurements later we have two final variations which you can use as needed. \r\n\r\nPart 1 - CurtainSlideV90, shown on the far right on the image thumbnail, is 90 degrees to the slide (looking straight at it you see the hole).\r\n\r\nPart 2 - CurtainSlideV180, shown second from the right on the image thumbnail, is 180 degrees to the slide (looking straight at it you cannot see the hole).\r\n\r\nIncluded are stl's of both types as well as the original sketchup design file, in case your T-Track uses a different size/manufacturer. \r\n\r\nOther Design Notes:\r\n1. For the hangers, make sure you are using Stainless Steel components. The ones used, and shown in the thumbnail images, were sourced at IKEA. 24 count to a pack, with the name DIGNITET across the front and cost about $6.00 USD. \r\n\r\n2. In one of the images you will see a couple of the many other variations we tried. While they did not meet my needs I am happy to post/share these if you would like, just throw a comment in the discussion section of the parts page. :)"
