function: "The first thing I ever designed and printed! \r\n\r\nThere are a number of other space invaders on here already, but they're either small, or made to accept a magnet, neither of which fit my needs.\r\n\r\nThis invader is quite large. I printed it at about 70% on a not particularly well calibrated printer (it was only my third print ever) and was very happy with the results, so it should be good even for beginners."
