function = "This is my answer to storing all those failed prints, and raft materials, and leftover filament, in a handy dandy containment unit, called a \"Maraca\". Make 2 or more and it's PARTY TIME! Make a derivative, or Mashup. The Handle has a key core that is 10mm diameter, with a 15mm x 5 mm key that twists into a keyhole (2mm material thickness for keyhole). It can be made on a Makerbot."
