A great way of celebrating the New Museum, MakerBot, 3D Printing, and the Old with Recycling. Maracas are festive. It requires recycled material in order to fill the maraca. It demonstrates, Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling. Each Maraca requires recycled material (leftover rafts, unfinished prints, and filament purgings) in order to make sound. It is a derivative of traditional maracas, and the New Museum print http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12159 . This design, is a bit bigger, and more hollowed out (in order to be printed with less, while filled with more recycled plastic).""" ;
