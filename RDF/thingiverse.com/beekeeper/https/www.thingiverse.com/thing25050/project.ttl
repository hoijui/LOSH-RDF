    okh:function """This is a Golf Cart, just in case you might need one for Golf-In-Miniature. It also looks a bit like a dune buggy. If you spend your life in the sand traps, there's really no difference. \r
\r
I might change it and add a roof, it it gets rainy. It was made so that 2 Lego Minifigs could sit side by side and have the cart be made in the style of the original "Toy Car" by atartanian.\r
\r
This revolutionary design, encapulates the wheels in the cart, so they are printed at the same time with NO ASSEMBLY NEEDED - genius. Nice work jag, madscifi, and atartanian. I REALLY like your cars.""" ;
