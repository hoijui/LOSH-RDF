function: Just a Parody. Truth is, it can be taken either way. I kind of like Darth Vader, even if he is bad. The guy looks great in black, and comes into the room with presence. If you like the Replicator 2 you hopefully will like this. If you hate the closed source of the Replicator 2, you will hopefully like this. Either perspective, it's Win-Win. Enjoy
