function = "The \"lightbulb\" is a 5-sided spiral that forms the general shape of a lightbulb.  I made this a few years ago as a test piece and I've updated it just for you.\r\n\r\nI've included two sizes:\r\n\r\nFull size: about 4.8 inches tall\r\nHalf size: about 2.4 inches tall (...yep, that's half...check!)\r\n\r\nI've also included each STL file in two resolutions.\r\n\r\nThis was used as a benchmark print in Make Magazine's 2013 3D Printer guide!"
