function: "I designed this rocket ship model as yet another overhang test. It was inspired by the ship created by Wallace and Grommit in \"Wallace and Grommit: A Grand Day Out.\"\r\n\r\nView ship here:\r\nhttp://cf1.imgobject.com/backdrops/dfe/4bc90873017a3c57fe002dfe/wallace-gromit-a-grand-day-out-original.jpg\r\n\r\nI streamlined the basic shape and tapered the doorway in order to reduce the angle of overhangs because I was trying to be nice to my printer."
