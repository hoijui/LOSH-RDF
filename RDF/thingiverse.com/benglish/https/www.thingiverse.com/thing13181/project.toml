function = "These are velcro mounts for the GoPro Hero video camera.  They were designed to easily attach to RC plane fuselages and wings.  I have since used them to attach the camera to my leg and helmet.  They work remarkably well.\r\n\r\nI used these mounts to film this video of my RC glider: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jVroP8jzSQ\r\n\r\nUpdate: After numerous flights, and other unplanned uses, the mounts are  holding up well.\r\n\r\nSlope Combat: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyWu5y56QWc"
