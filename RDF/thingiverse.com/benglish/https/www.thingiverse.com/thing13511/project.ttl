    okh:function """This is my first OpenSCAD project.  It is a screwdriver rack that can be mounted to any flat, vertical surface. It came out pretty well, so I thought I'd share it with you great folks here on Thingiverse.  I added guides to keep top-heavy screwdrivers or allen wrenches from falling over.\r
\r
I've done my best to make it full Parametric.\r
\r
The width, depth, thickness, number of holes, hole sizes, progressive hole sizing, reinforcing structure are all easily modified.  \r
\r
I have included a few STL files (more upon request).  They are 120mm wide and have 6 screwdriver holes in them.  One is progressive from 2.5mm dia to 5mm dia and the other has 6 4mm dia holes.  I don't know what the bed-size is on the TOM.  If this .STL file doesn't fit, tell me and I'll upload one that does (or you can change the width in code!...WOOOOooOpenSCAD!).""" ;
