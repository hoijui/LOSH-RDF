function = "The Nautilus from the Shellter project was really cool, so I sliced it and added an ring to it.  However, I wanted to do something that only a 3D printer could do, so I scrapped that and made this from scratch instead.  While making the outline I made her name in the center, to make them uniquely hers.  \n\n\n\nI know that that move doesn't help 99.9% of you out there. She didn't notice her name until I told her, so maybe yours won't notice either!  \n\n\n\nUpdate:  I've added files for a shell without a name (but have not tested them)."
