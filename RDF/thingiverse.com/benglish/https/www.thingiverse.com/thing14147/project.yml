function: "It is common knowledge that nothing can withstand a shark's crushing bite, even the cap of a beer bottle. When it came time to design a bottle opener, there was only one logical choice.  Dunnn Naa  Dunn Naa\r\n\r\nAre you ready to tear into bottle tops with a fury only known to predators millions of years old?  Well then, get cutting!\r\n\r\n...But what if it is a twist off?  Ah, I've got you covered!  Use the hook to keep your hands cut free!  The shark also hangs from the hook when not in use, keeping the two parts together and your options wide open.  \r\n\r\nThis was done for my Stanford ME318 (CNC Milling) project."
