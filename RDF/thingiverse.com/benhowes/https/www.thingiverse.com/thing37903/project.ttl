\r
I made these for a Christmas meal and gave one to each of our guests. Everyone really liked them so I decided to share! I've put the STL of my initials here so you can see roughly what's going on, all other combinations are in the 'Placeholder_all.zip' archive.\r
\r
If your looking to make in batches of >20, with the suggested print settings and LED tealights, they can be made for less than Â£1 GBP ($1.60 USD approx) per piece with the LED tealights.""" ;
