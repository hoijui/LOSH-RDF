function: "Printed initials which can be used in the place of place cards, or just as a nice little thing to have on your shelf/desk. Add an LED tea-light for that little something extra.\r\n\r\nI made these for a Christmas meal and gave one to each of our guests. Everyone really liked them so I decided to share! I've put the STL of my initials here so you can see roughly what's going on, all other combinations are in the 'Placeholder_all.zip' archive.\r\n\r\nIf your looking to make in batches of >20, with the suggested print settings and LED tealights, they can be made for less than \xC2\xA31 GBP ($1.60 USD approx) per piece with the LED tealights."
