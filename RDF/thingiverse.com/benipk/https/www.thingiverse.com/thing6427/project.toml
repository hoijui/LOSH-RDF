function = "This is a spreadsheet to get feed rates for your TOM into the ballpark for nice printing, based on a W/T and a layer height you choose. Flow rate is fixed at 255 PWM due to the extruder firmware and the spreadsheet also helps determine what your flowrate is.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress, I cannot be responsible for you totalling your TOM as some basic assumptions I have may be wrong, and my math might be crap. Thanks to Dave Durant who steered my thinking in a different direction, and gave me some impetus to think of an easier way to calibrate my 'bot."
