\r
This is a work in progress, I cannot be responsible for you totalling your TOM as some basic assumptions I have may be wrong, and my math might be crap. Thanks to Dave Durant who steered my thinking in a different direction, and gave me some impetus to think of an easier way to calibrate my 'bot.""" ;
