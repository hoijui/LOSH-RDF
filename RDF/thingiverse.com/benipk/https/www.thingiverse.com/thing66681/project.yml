function: "Having recently gotten into the Star Wars X-Wing miniatures game, I felt that the 2D asteroid templates that come with the game were a little dull. These six 3D asteroids are roughly the same base area as the six cardboard tokens in the game, but will look much more interesting.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=174\r\n\r\nI'll make 3D versions of some of the other tokens shortly."
