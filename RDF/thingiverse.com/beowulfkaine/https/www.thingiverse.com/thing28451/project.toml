function = "I needed a clamp for my motion capture camera's and I didnt want to pay 20$ for 20, so I decided to make them, my fist attempt was wooden, they worked for a while but over time I realized that they would warp and the cameras would move - which is not good for calibration.\r\n\r\nThen I decided to learn solidworks and design a new holder and I came up with this new one, it works great and this saved me $400 from having to buy them on eBay!\r\n\r\n\r\nI've included the \"Final Camera Holder\" file and the \"Single Camera Holder\" File and the Camera Post.\r\nYou need the Final Camera Holder and Post, the Single Camera Holder is for misprints so you don't have to print 2 at a time."
