function = "Squirrels love a nut.  Airtrippers suck with a nut.  I've never had mine pop off, but I have a hell of a time getting in new filament, so I have modified it to accept a threaded adapter for the bowden tube.  This is derived from my other derived airtripper, and from the threaded bowden clamp posted by jamesarm97.  This is not parametric, so if it doesn't fit for you, bust out the files or sandpaper."
