function = "This can be used to clip an acrylic sheet over the MakerBot Replicator window. The large gap is 0.54mm (13.7\") (the thickness of the Replicator wall) and the small gap is 1.5mm (0.059\") (which should fit some acrylic sheets). I've also included a 2.2mm (0.87\") thick one also, which can fit other acrylic sheets."
