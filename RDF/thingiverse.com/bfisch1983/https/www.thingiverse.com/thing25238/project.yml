function: "I made this for my Star Wars Costume.  There is an old RPG source book. \"Galladinium's Fantastic Technology\"  That had a small picture of a dissuader.  That is what I based this design on.  I had to guess at the dimensions and I changed the grip to be more comfortable.\r\nI did all of the work in blender."
