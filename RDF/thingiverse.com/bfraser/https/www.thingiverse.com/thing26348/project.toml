function = "I can't be the first to do this, but I was unable to find any examples out there. My apologies to any and all for lack of attribution. \r\n\r\nThe Replicator has a LOT of extra room inside. About 3.5\" extra room. I print a lot of large PLA prints which connect together to make larger pieces and thought it was about time to max out my Replicators. So here is my proof of concept.\r\n\r\nThe actual available build space (for a single extruder replicator) is 6\" x 12.5\" or about 150mm x 320mm\r\n\r\nThis is only for people who print with PLA and turn off the heated bed entirely. Like me :)"
