\r
The Replicator has a LOT of extra room inside. About 3.5" extra room. I print a lot of large PLA prints which connect together to make larger pieces and thought it was about time to max out my Replicators. So here is my proof of concept.\r
\r
The actual available build space (for a single extruder replicator) is 6" x 12.5" or about 150mm x 320mm\r
\r
This is only for people who print with PLA and turn off the heated bed entirely. Like me :)""" ;
