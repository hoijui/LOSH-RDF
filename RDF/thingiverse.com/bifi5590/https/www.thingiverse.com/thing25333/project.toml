function = "This was created for my mobile systems exam at university of applied science in Lemgo, Germany.  \n\nThis app can visualize GCode (created with Slic3r) for RepRap and Makerbot 3D printers.  \n\nIt can also color code the Gcode when you enable the verbose Gcode in Slic3r.  \n\nSee it in Action:  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWZBLxS9sF8  \n\nUpdate (06.02.2013):  \nI now have a Lenovo IdeaTab with Android 4.0.3. I tried my GCodeViewer and the app crashes all the time. I will try to update the app to work with more devices. I hope I find some time between my exams and my bachelor thesis to work on this project again. :)"
