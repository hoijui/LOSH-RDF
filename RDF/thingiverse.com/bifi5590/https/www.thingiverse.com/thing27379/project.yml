function: "This is my first try on building an Android app. It was also the first time I had to deal with OpenGL.  \n\nThis was part of an exam at my university. Got a 1.0 for it! Yaaay :)  \n\nExam finished so here you go with the source code as promised.  \n\nFind the latest version here:  \nhttps://bitbucket.org/bifi5590/android-gcode-viewer  \n\nMy Bachelor Thesis is taking away most of my free time so further changes can take some time. Still have to rewrite the 3D visualization."
