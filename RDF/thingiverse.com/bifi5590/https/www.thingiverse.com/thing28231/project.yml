function: "This is a simple phone mount I designed to attach my GT551 to my bicycle.\r\n\r\nThe mount does not cover speakers or the headphone jack but the micro usb port is not accessible when clipped in. Maybe I give it another go in some time.\r\n\r\nThe part should be symmetrical but\r\nmy Y-Axis somehow slipped a bit so the part came out pretty ugly but it holds the phone very snugly."
