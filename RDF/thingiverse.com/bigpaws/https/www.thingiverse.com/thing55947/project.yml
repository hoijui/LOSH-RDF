function: "I designed this for the purpose of having something I can quickly print that uses little plastic, but, demonstrates 3D printing.  I can print these in about 6 minutes and give them away. \r\n\r\nIt's a simple Smiley Face FOB with its tongue sticking out.  \r\n\r\nNOTE: I realized that the circular tab at the top wasn't flush with the bottom - that's been fixed.\r\n\r\nSmile2F.stl is the one you want.  The other is just there for posterity"
