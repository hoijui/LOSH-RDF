function = "I didn't want to solder the wires to my heated build platform.  I was also afraid that using 3 pin and 2 pin headers would, they would come apart or get damaged while printing.  It's also hard to grab those little suckers in the back of your bot.\r\n\r\nThis connector slides over the wires and a full length 10 pin female header and holds everthing in place tightly.  I put a little hot glue on the wires, but it really wasn't necessary.  This not only provides support and strain relief for the solder connection, but also provides a good surface for your fingers to purchase on for taking the connector on and off when you need to access the HBP - like when you want to remove or apply painters tape."
