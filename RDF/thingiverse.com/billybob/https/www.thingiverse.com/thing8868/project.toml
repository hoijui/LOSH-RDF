function = "This is a modification to the wonderfully simple design by nicgravel found here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7484\r\n\r\nThis design is based on a 60mm LED ring.  I loved the original design and actually had an 80mm ring mounted to my bot for a while, but I liked the 60mm ring better because it is closer to the extruder and highlights the extrusion better while printing.  It is very easy to see how close you are above the part surface with the smaller ring."
