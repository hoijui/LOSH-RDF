function = "I originally designed this bracket to hold my control panel based on Revar's LCD controller found here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2836\r\n\r\nYou can see the control panel and bracket pair in the pictures to the left.  However, these brackets can be used to hold any other panels or objects to the front, side, or back of your bot.  They are pretty strong and just hang on the open window.  I've included both 30 degree and 45 degree versions of the brackets.  The front face holds just short of a 100mm device, the panel in the picture is actually 100mm wide.\r\n\r\nA pair of them are stable and if they are mounted out to the edges as I have done, they are extremely stable.  The results were actually better than I expected.\r\n\r\nMaybe they will inspire other brackets of this type."
