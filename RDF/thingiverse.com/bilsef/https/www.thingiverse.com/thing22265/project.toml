function = "Laser cut Y axis frame for MendelMax.  Modified from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21638.  I changed the slot width to 6mm and changed the floating rod holes from a 10mm circle to 8mm slot.  This lets the rod float only in the X axis.  I recommend using only one bushing on the floating rod."
