function: "This parametric scad file can be customized to create bushing holders for SDP-SI press fit self aligning bushings.  It can also create holders for delrin dowels to make 180 degree bushings.  For my Y-Axis, I use two self aligning bushings on one shaft and two 180 degree bushings on the other shaft.  Delrin (acetal) dowel pins are available from McMaster-Carr http://www.mcmaster.com/#plastic-dowel-pins or you can cut them from delrin rod.  They will wear much better than PLA or ABS.\r\n\r\nFor the 180 degree bearings, you might have to print them a couple of times, making adjustments for your printer.  You want them to be matched exactly to your shaft diameter."
