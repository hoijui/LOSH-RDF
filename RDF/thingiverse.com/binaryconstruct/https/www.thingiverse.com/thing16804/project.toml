function = "This is a mashup of Greg's and the modified Arcol carriage.\r\n\r\nIt keeps the original dimensions of Greg's X carriage with the wide belt mounts (so you can use shorter belts if you accidentally cut them too much like me).\r\n\r\nParts added: 4th bearing fitting, more holes for mounting the extruder, round hole for nozzle\r\n\r\nThe belt groves are modified for GT2 but you can change it in the scad."
