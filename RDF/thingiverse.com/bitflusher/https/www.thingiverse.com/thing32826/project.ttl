    okh:function """reprap prusa rigidity wall hack. it takes minutes and not hours to print and mount. This has been attached for over a month but it took me until now to take a picture.\r
\r
While searching to eliminate some of my problems this did the trick in eliminating the main source of wobble: Bolt it to a wall!\r
It seems kind of hacky since, and it is. I had a psu mount bracket laying around, bolted it to the wall at the correct height. My z axis smoothrod snaps on to it making it really easy to remove my reprap from the wall whenever needed. \r
\r
Oh and because it is so hacky you even have to drill the extra hole ;)\r
\r
Good luck reinforcing your frame with the aid of a wall.""" ;
