function = "My first attempt at a useful thing.  I'm learning openSCAD in anticipation of receiving my printrbot+ and I thought I would make something useful.  This is a parametric pillow block.  At least I think its parametric... (still learning the ropes here) If you change the parameters at the beginning of the file you can change pretty much everything and get a nice customized pillow block.\r\n\r\nyou can even make it into a bushing by setting the \"lip_size\" to zero and increasing the \"bearing_thickness\".\r\n\r\nEdit: version 0.2.  I fixed a mixup between diameter and radius and added some more comments.  The SCAD file is theoretically set up for a 608 skate bearing with tabs for m5 bolts."
