This is a parametric pillow block.  At least I think its parametric... (still learning the ropes here) If you change the parameters at the beginning of the file you can change pretty much everything and get a nice customized pillow block.\r
\r
you can even make it into a bushing by setting the "lip_size" to zero and increasing the "bearing_thickness".\r
\r
Edit: version 0.2.  I fixed a mixup between diameter and radius and added some more comments.  The SCAD file is theoretically set up for a 608 skate bearing with tabs for m5 bolts.""" ;
