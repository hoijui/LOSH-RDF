function = "Using an RGB LED and a CDS photocell, I created a color sensor for use in a robotics competition.  The sensor holds both the LED and the phtocell and provides a baffle between them so the CDS cell only sees the reflected light.  By observing the amount of red, green and blue reflected, you can determine the color.\r\n\r\nVideos:\r\nPart 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpiCV7Leegk\r\nPart 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccXk3cwn0Bk\r\nPart 3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgW6iJvywh4\r\nPart 4: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCdaVU2rXHg\r\nPart 5: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTKlPUFRejY"
