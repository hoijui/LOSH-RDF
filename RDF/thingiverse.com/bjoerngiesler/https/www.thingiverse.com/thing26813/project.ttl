    okh:function """The 520DX is very popular with harmonica players and some singers use it as a special FX mic due to its specific mid-range tone. But when you're not cupping it in your hand, you can't put it anywhere. There's no mount for a mic stand, and the round shape and heavy cable mean it's prone to fall off a table.  



This clip holds the mic tight but it's easy to take it out.  The mounting block has one hole for a 5/8"-to-3/8" adapter (mount top of mic stand) and one that can be threaded for M8 (mount anywhere else).""" ;
