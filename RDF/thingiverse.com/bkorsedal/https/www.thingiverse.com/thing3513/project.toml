function = "This is the GM17 gearmotor from solarbotics.com modeled in OpenSCAD.  It's all done in inches (I hate the English system, but that's what the vendor gave me).  There is also some extra information from the manufacture.  This is a cool gear motor and can be useful if you want to add motion to your designs.  \r\n\r\nUse the outlines to cut out areas for mounting the motor."
