    okh:function """So I recently saw a blog post on hypocycloid gears on the Reprap Blog ( http://fabricationsofthemind.com/2010/07/09/extruder-design-1-printable-1001-hypocycloidal-gearbox/ ) .  \r
\r
Some really good info on them can be found here:\r

\r
Also do a search on youtube for hypocycloid reducer.  Lots of vids.\r

They seem to be perfect for a robot arm joint.  I want to make a robot arm.  I started to put one together in OpenSCAD.  I have way more than I'm uploading here, but this is just the arm joint.  The outside layers are fixed and the inside four layers rotate as the gears turn.  I wanted to cut this using ponoko bamboo, but there is no way to go from OpenSCAD to ponoko bamboo (that I know of).  I don't have a makerbot yet.  \r
\r
Hopefully someone can pick this up and run with it.  The file needs to be edited quite a bit to print it out on a Reprap or something.  Drop me a message if you want to print this out and I can help you understand the file.""" ;
