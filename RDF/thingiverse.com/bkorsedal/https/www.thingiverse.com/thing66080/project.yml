function: "I don't think this structure is printable.  It's autogenerated by our custom software.  It's a 3D render of the structure you can buy from us.  We invented a house printer.  We'll sell this structure for $2256.80 utilizing a hybrid steel/bamboo strut design.  It comes unassembled and you just bolt it together.  Comes along with pdf instructions for assembly and all the parts are numbered.\r\n\r\nWe can compile any structure you want.  Contact us for more info.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Arcology-Now-Inc/525045390881339"
