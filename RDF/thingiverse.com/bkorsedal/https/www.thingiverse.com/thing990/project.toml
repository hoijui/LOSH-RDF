function = "This is an SVG file created in Inkscape that can be used to create a zoetrope.  There are 21 slats that need to have images placed on them.  \r\n\r\nYou need a laser cutter with at least a 12 inch by 24 inch bed.  This design uses any material which is about 6 mm thick.  I use Midwest Plywood 24x12 inch poplar plywood (6mm thick).  However, I suggest getting baltic birch plywood.  It's about a $1 more per sheet but I think it will look a lot better."
