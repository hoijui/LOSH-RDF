Make the file executeable, and it should run on the slightly outdated ubuntu hardy, that is necessary to run the free cnc-controller software emc2.\r
geargen_hardy is just this version\r
\r
however, gearsgcode.py is an advanced script, that will also create a ngc gcode file.\r
it is parameterized.\r
It has cutter compensation enabled. Therefore, you need to have a valid tooltable in emc2. Also, you need to make the parameter #5 a little bit larger than the tool radius, so the initial move works.\r
If the tool radius is too large for the dents, emc2 will complain.\r
Also, it is recommended that the clearance specified via -c is larger then the tool radius, so there is no friction in the groves.""" ;
