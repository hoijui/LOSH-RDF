function = "The filament path is enclosed sidewards. This enables filament change, because it is much less likely to get stuck on the way, e.g. the gap at the end.\r\n\r\nThere are additional screw holes, to avoid any possible gaps. 3.2mm one side, and 2.4 so they can be threaded directly without nuts."
