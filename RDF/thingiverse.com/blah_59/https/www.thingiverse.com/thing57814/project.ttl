    okh:function """This is a derivitive of roberlin's j-head mount: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53560.  

I decided to replace the last original part on my QU-BD (besides the stepper motor and fan), the hot end.  My J-Head is still in the mail but I wanted to get a jump start on a mount for it and found roberlin's mount that looked great.  The only thing I noticed was that it would hang lower than the QU-BD hot end and I didn't want to sacrifice the Z space on my Ord Bot.  So with a little tweaking of the original design this leaves about the same amount of Z-height.  I raised the center portion to lift the hot end and added some support behind the mount to raise/hold the stepper motor up.  

I have a newer version of this thing here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:77357 that raises the nozzle up even more to provide more Z height.""" ;
