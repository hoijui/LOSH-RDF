function = "Huge 30mm dice, poorly weighted, and not rounded.  This is my first OpenSCAD project.  I have no idea if it will print correctly.  I followed the tutorial from MakerBlock http://blog.makerbot.com/2011/01/19/openscad-basics-the-setup/\r\n\r\nThe dice model has holes all the way through where possible (so 4 to 6, 2 to 5) which makes for interesting but ultimately rather worthless dice (as the title suggests). I found the design a good test of the translate, rotate, and difference skills I learned from the tutorial."
