function = "##### Warning:\r\nThis item I modeled a long time ago but never printed. I would look over it carefully before considering printing this. I doubt the side connectors or the snap on lids leave enough space to actually connect.\r\n\r\n##### Original\r\nRandom bits sort box for screws or anything else small.  I made the insides of each sort section and the main front sort area curved to (hopefully) improve the ease of removing bits quickly.  It can also be connected to another sort box to make a mega sort box, or connected to two for a super-mega sort box.\r\n\r\nThis passed ReplicatorG gcode generation, but as I have no printer (yet) it is untested.\r\n\r\nThis was built in Google Sketchup and was a giant pain to remove all the interior extras that got left behind from modeling so Skeinforge would stop saying \"this should never happen\" errors over and over.\r\n\r\nUpdate #1: I modified the sort box (sortboxb.stl) to have a deeper front sort area mostly to reduce the amount of plastic used.\r\n\r\nUpdate #2: Added top for the smaller individual sort areas (passed gcode generation)."
