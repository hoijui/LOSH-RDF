function: "The Z-Axis follower is designed to be inserted into one or both sides of the z-axis ToM where the press-fit bearing would go in-between the top and bottom z-axis pieces.  This is an untested prototype that I thought I would put on thingiverse to see if anyone saw any obvious flaws.  I will be printing this soon to try it out.\r\n\r\nThe goal was to make it fit inside the regular z-axis constraints and require minimal modification to the z-axis (4 screw holes currently).\r\n\r\nThere are obviously no bearings on one side due to space constraints, but I was hoping having two of these would essentially force the z-axis to push against the inside bearings.\r\n\r\nIf this works it would probably wise to add screw holes to secure it to the z-axis side pieces to improve rigidity.\r\n\r\nThe design is ugly and boring but it is somewhat easy to modify.  I used Sketchup which I know is disappointing to many, but I am a visual person and struggle with OpenSCAD."
