function = "This was my prototype: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9187\r\n\r\nVersion 2 reduces plastic and print time and cleans up spacing.  It works but is by no means long-term tested.  My bot does not seem to have any issues with binding at the top like it used to.  I am using only one of these things on the right side, the other side still has brass press-fit bearings.\r\n\r\nThe Z-Axis follower is designed to be inserted into one or both sides of the z-axis ToM where the press-fit bearing would go in-between the top and bottom z-axis pieces.\r\n\r\nThe goal was to make it fit inside the regular z-axis constraints and require minimal modification to the z-axis (now only 2 screw holes).\r\n\r\nOriginal Sketchup file included for whatever modifications people want to make."
