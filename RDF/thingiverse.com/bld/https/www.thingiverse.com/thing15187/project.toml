function = "One hinge broke off the paper tray door of my parents' Epson Artisan 725 printer. This part can be taped/glued/etc. into the unused slot behind the hinge, with the new hinge hanging outside the tray. May work better with ABS. The PLA came out kind of melted, and required some cleanup of the shaft to make it fit."
