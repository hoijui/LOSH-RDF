function: "This is a model of Earth made of a sphere with two displacement maps. A specular map displaces the land & ice masses above the oceans. A topography map adds texture to the land. This exaggerates the texture more than a topography map alone. It was inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14070 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11660  \r\n\r\nNow available on Github: https://github.com/bld/Textured-Earth"
