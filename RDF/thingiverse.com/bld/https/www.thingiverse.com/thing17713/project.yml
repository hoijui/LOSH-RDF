function: "Something of a failed experiment. It works - it's just very difficult to grab the spherical shape and turn the gears. I don't recommend printing this for that reason. However, I think it's a good example of turning your own models into gears with the excellent parts this is derived from.  \r\n\r\nNow available on Github: https://github.com/bld/Earth-Gears\r\n\r\nSee this thing for an improvement: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:748202"
