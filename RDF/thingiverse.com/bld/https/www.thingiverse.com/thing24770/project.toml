function = "I was building my first high powered rocket - a LOC Precision Aura - and I wanted a jig to epoxy the fins and launch lug on straight. I designed this thing to print a pair of jigs to stick in either end of the body tube - one end with engine mount. The fins are held with strips of thin plywood held with spring clamps & wedges. A piece of threaded rod with nuts on either end holds the launch lug in place, while putting the jigs in tension. This setup allowed me to epoxy all the fins and the launch lug at once."
