function = "Fully parametric ogive nose cone with a screw-on base. This allows the nosecone to be entirely printed, and used as a small payload bay. The ogive shape is created by revolving a circular arc, combined with a spherical tip. Uses syvwlch's thread library. More parametric model rocket parts to come. Default size is for some extra thin-walled 1.63\"/41.5mm diameter cardboard body tube I have. Includes integrated reinforcement bar and mounting holes for tying a shock cord to the base.  \n\nNow available at Github: https://github.com/bld/Parametric-Threaded-Ogive-Rocket-Nose-Cone"
