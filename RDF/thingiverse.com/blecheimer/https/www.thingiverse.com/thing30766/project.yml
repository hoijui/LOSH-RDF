function: "Disclaimer:\r\nDue to the recent incidents (things appearing on ebay) I just want to make something very clear:\r\nI do not allow any commercial use of my STL-files, my designs and my photos!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nI was tired of using the crappy original servos on my Losi Mini-LST2. They never last very long and you always have to replace two of them. \r\nMy prefered servo is a Hitec HS-82 MG with a Kimbrough servo-saver. But it does not fit... \r\n\r\nSo I designed a single servo bracket that can be installed easily in my Losi Mini-LST2."
