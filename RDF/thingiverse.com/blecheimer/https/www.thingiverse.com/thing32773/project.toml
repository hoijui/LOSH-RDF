function = "Description:\r\nI like small things. And I like vehicles. Why not combine both and make a very small dumper? The Micro Dumper I designed is 25 x 20 x 17 mm (1 x 0.8 x 0.65 in).  \r\n\r\nI was curious if my Ultimaker can print such a small object...  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:  \r\n\r\nI added a chassis with smaller holes for the axis. Try this version if the axis are sitting too loose in the chassis.  \r\n\r\nIf the wheels are sitting too tight you can try the new version with bigger holes."
