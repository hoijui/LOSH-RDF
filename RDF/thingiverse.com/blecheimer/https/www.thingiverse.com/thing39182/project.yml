function: "Disclaimer:\r\nDue to the recent incidents (things appearing on ebay) I just want to make something very clear:\r\nI do not allow any commercial use of my STL-files, my designs and my photos!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nIt is Christmas and all shops are closed. But I really do need some c-type batteries and I need them now. \r\nSimple solution - print an adapter for rechargable AA batteries (I have a lot of them).\r\n\r\nThere are some adapters from AA to C on thingiverse, I tried them but they did not do the job. Some are too thight for my rechargable AAs, some are too big and so on. So I just made my own adapter."
