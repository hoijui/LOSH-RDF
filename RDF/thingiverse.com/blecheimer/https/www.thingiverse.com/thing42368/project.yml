function: "Disclaimer:\r\nDue to the recent incidents (things appearing on ebay) I just want to make something very clear:\r\nI do not allow any commercial use of my STL-files, my designs and my photos!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nSometimes you just need a simple clamp ... well, at least I did yesterday to seal my tea bags.\r\nTook me three prototypes to get the tension right, but now the clamp is clamping like it should. And it looks like a fish. That doesn't matter, I just wanted to mention it. ;-)"
