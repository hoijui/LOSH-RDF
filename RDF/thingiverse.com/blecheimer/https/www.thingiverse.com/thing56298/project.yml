function: "Disclaimer:\r\nDue to the recent incidents (things appearing on ebay) I just want to make something very clear:\r\nI do not allow any commercial use of my STL-files, my designs and my photos!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nYes, it is another ball bearing. I was a little bit bored and this is the result...\r\nThe ball bearing uses 6mm softair ammo and is designed to snap together. No glue necessary. It has an inner diameter of 10mm and 28 on the outside.\r\nThe print will take 15...20 min.\r\n\r\nI made a video to show the assembly:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/uXTspufYuXM\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI uploaded two new inner parts with an diameter of 8mm."
