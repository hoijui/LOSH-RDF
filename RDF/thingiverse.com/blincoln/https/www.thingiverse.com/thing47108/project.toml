function = "My first design, a small die in a larger die box with a working snap-fit hinge. Both dice are usable - even with one inside the other - but no guarantees about randomness.\r\n\r\nMade to print with PLA in high resolution on e.g. a Replicator 2. \r\n\r\nCreated in Autodesks interesting (and free for now) Inventor Fusion."
