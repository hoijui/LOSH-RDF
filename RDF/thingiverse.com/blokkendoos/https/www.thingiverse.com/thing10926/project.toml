function = "Note this was made for the RAMPS 1.3 board.  \r\n\r\nSlight improvements; leveled the board, added powerjacket and repositioned USB hole.  \r\n\r\nVentilation added, dimensions based on Sepa MFB25B12 12VDC fan http://nl.farnell.com/sepa/mfb25b12/fan-25mm-12vdc/dp/1217961.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case is used for a milling machine with relatively slow stepper speeds, no extruderheater and no heated build platform.  \r\n\r\nThe fan is connected to screw terminal D9, with the fan pin assigned to it. Given the fan is quite noisy, I think of adding a thermistor later on and tweak the code so that the Arduino takes care of adaptive cooling.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVentilation efficiency has not been verified with RAMPS driving a RepRap with extruderheater or heated build platform.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2011-08-24 Minor update (pcb space) of the covers   \r\n2011-08-25 The obvious showed after the first print: the fan had to be moved up (to get max airflow along the stepper drivers)  \r\n2011-08-29 Attached final OpenSCAD and .stl files.  \r\n2015-09-14 Added RAMPS 1.3 note\r\n2015-11-06 Connector panel, see https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1115903"
