function = "In case you want to use the Nanotec stepperdriver boards for your 3D, e.g. RepRap, printer, this board might be of use. It provides for the recommended capacitor and connectors for (AMP) Power, steppermotoer, and Min/Max sensors. Use it for the X, Y, Z and (optionally) extruder steppermotors.\r\nThe nanotec board provides microstepping (1/8 or 1/16 for SMC11 or SMC11-2 respectively)\r\n\r\nThe connector pin layout is conform the gen3 electronics motherboard as used in the RepRap and MakerBot 3D printers.\r\n\r\nAttached is a PCB version as well as a Veroboard layout."
