function = "A Y-axis bearing upgrade for a Bits From Bytes RapMan (2008 version 2)\r\nPrinting two Stanford bunnies was too much for the Y-axis :-)\r\n\r\nTo replace the bearing, loosen the cornerblock bolts and slide out the bar just enough to replace the bearing. I put  a short piece of 8mm rod in the cornerblock both to push the rod out and at the same time keep the loosened cornerblock stable.\r\n\r\nThe length of the block is such that it can be printed on a TOM or MakerBot. If you have a larger capacity 3D printer I suggest to lengthen the block so it holds the bearing over its full length."
