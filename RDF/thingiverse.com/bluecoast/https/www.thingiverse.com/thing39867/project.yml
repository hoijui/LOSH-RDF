function: This is a quarter-turn clip for holding wires etc. into Misumi 2020 extrusion. Handy, works, and doesn't look too horrible. I made about four different versions (in Sketchup), some of which were unnecessarily large or didn't slice or print well. The final winner is uppermost in the photo and 12mm in diameter.
