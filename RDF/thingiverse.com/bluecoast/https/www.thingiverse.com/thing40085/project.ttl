\r
I have a heavy Y assembly and am trying to use as high a belt tension as possible, maybe even with a wider belt in future. Anyway, my (over)tensioning bent Simonious' wider version of the Mendelmax 1.5 Y belt tensioner, and once the bending started, the belt always rode to one side and dragged. This part is intended to fix both the bending and lack of tracking adjustment -- now the bearing shaft rides in two trusses that span directly from the hinge pin to their own tensioning screw.  I also hexed out the bottoms of the hinge nut pockets since they're in the middle of the truss. It now looks plenty strong for my purposes (a bit like a plastic valve rocker).""" ;
