function = "Added STEP file format.  \n\n\n\n\nMy Replicator 2 filament tube would not stay attached to the tube brackets.  The tube was a snug fit but works for me.  This clips on the top of the Rep2 with the tube support running vertically.  \n\nNew version keeps the item better snapped onto the Rep 2 top frame near the original tube holder"
