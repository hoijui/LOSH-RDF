function: "V4 - Updated to make the two holes that access the screws that attach the fan duct to the aluminum block a slot to ease screw access.  Also extended channel upwards to provide a better attachment of the cable bundle to the part.  \n\n\n\nI overheated my Replicator 2 aluminum heat sink one day and messed up my original fan mount.  This one has a higher horizontal part to allow for more room for the spring loaded filament loaders, as well as holes to allow access to the fan mount screws from above.  The two small rectangular parts in the cable bundle attachment point snap off.  The piece across the diameter is meant to help hold the fan cable and the small overhang in the cable groove allows for better capture of the thermocouple and heater wires."
