function = "The part is design to allow bent threaded rods move more freely, so that the z-wobble is eliminated. However, the design is not perfected. I think it removes about 60% of the wobble. The design was inspired by chylld's corner set for rapman; in fact, I used the dimensions from the stl file to make this part. Thanks chylld.\r\n\r\nI should mention, though, that this design would work better when the corner bed holder uses only one nut. I will be testing this with chylld's corner design.\r\n\r\nVIDEO:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/EsNoyRQnc-0"
