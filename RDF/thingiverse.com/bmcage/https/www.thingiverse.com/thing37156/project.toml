function = "A simple bracelet that is easy to generate and slice, and that is not 100% rigid as many other bracelets on Thingiverse.  \n\n\n\nI could not print the bracelet of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6961 as there was an artifact in the middle, and then openscad failed to work with the scad file provided there. So I tweaked the scad file so generation would be quick."
