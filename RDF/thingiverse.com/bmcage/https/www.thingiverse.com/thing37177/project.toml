function = "Adapted from the original thing for printing in one piece, as well as some other changes to make it actually tip when printed in one piece (oblate sphere). Two halves on one plate or the entire thing. As bonus, same for original. Sanding needed!\r\n\r\nNote that this is actually the tippe top according to the 1951 German patent. First patent of 1891 does not have a cylindrical cut-out.\r\n\r\nProTip: print one at 10% infill and 1 extra boundary layer (=normal top ) and one at 95% (=tippe top). Give the one of 10 to a friend, and tell him to make it tip like you do yours :-)"
