function: "Sign-generator-openscad \r\n\r\nSo I am waiting for a Printrbot.\r\n\r\nI wanted something simple to print out as my first print. I really liked the http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14728 Printrbot ID with number on thingiverse.com. I downloaded the files and played with it, but I wanted to customise it a little more.\r\n\r\nHave looked around at https://www.google.com/search?q=openscad+3d+text+tutorial openscad 3d text tutorials, I wanted something that was really simple to use, so here it is:-\r\n\r\nhttp://sign-generator.b9c.org/\r\n\r\nGo to New Sign enter some text, some dimensions, look at the preview - download the files. Viola. \r\n\r\nHow it works: Django applcaiton. The text is made in to a SVG graphics file. Using inkscape, the SVG is converted to a eps files - and a PNG used for previewing. The eps is then converted to dxf using pstoedit. The a text files is generated for OpendSCAD which extrudes the dxf file.  Further details can be gained from the sources files - http://code.google.com/p/sign-generator-openscad/\r\n\r\nThe server is host a very, very cheap VPS. So sometime the production of file may take up to 1 min.\r\n\r\nThanks to OpenSCAD\r\nThanks to MCAD https://github.com/elmom/MCAD\r\n\r\nBrook, is it February yet ?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nBrendan M. Sleight\r\n@bmsleight"
