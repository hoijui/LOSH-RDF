It is designed to be fixed by the two M5 bolts that are used to anchor the X carriage belt. \r\n\r\nNote on step 2:\r\n\r\nThe mounting holes are designed to self-tap with a M5 bolt, it is recommended to get the thread started a few turns by careful screwing in an M5 bolt before trying to mount on machine."
