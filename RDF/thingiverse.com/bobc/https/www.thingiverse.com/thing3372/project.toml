function = "A two part box consisting of a lower and upper shell. The lower part is screwed to the upper part. Mounting bosses enable a PCB to be mounted in upper or lower part.\r\n\r\nThe inner dimensions are 104x62x22mm. The reason for the odd placement of mounting bosses is because our PCB was designed to fit in a Hammond case.\r\n\r\nGenerated from OpenSCAD script, may be customised.\r\n\r\nThe exploded view shows a PCB mounted in the lower half shell.\r\n\r\nDesigned for Lyre* project, a project to design and build a Free/Open hardware audio player (DAP) and recorder, for use with Rockbox firmware**.\r\n\r\n* lyre.sourceforge.net\r\n** rockbox.org\r\n\r\nStatus : not tested\r\nRev 2: place the mounting points for Lyre v1 PCB\r\nTODO: add apertures for connectors, LCD"
