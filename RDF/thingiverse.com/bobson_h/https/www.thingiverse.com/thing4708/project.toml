function = "This is a derivative work of the iris box (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4458) by msruggles.\r\nI tried to print msruggles's iris box for my son, but failed. I think my bot is not so well-tuned that it simply cannot handle the tiny gears well, also my self-built HBP has a limited effective building area for like 80mm x80mm including the raft. So I redesigned the box to be more fool-bot friendly. Small enough in size, and no tiny gear teeth. If you have trouble printing the iris box, try this one."
