function: "I know there have been several D6 over time on here, but I have been meaning to do this for some time. Having played Gamma World last night for the first time in about 30 years, I felt the push to go on with this. (Timey whimey!) \r\n\r\nI based this design on the set of ivory dice my Dad had when I was a kid. (I am pretty sure I am responsible for their loss.) The ivory die had different size holes cut into them to account for the balance of the die. The 1 had a large hole, the 6 had small holes. (The sizes on mine are pure guess work. Sorry, no math to ensure they are actually correct in their volume.) I also made sure this followed the standard practice on die where the opposite sides of a die add up to the largest side +1 in number. So, and two opposite sides on a D6 should add up to 7.\r\n\r\nThis die is oversized at 25mm, just about an inch.\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad.
