function: "Wanted to make another one. Despite the inspiration sketch, this was inspired more by old tin robots, TV and my Dad's old portable reel to reel.\r\n\r\nThis one is pretty tiny compared to the last one, but it is all in one plate... except for the pegs.\r\n\r\nThis one was made entirely in TinkerCad. I just imported it into SketchUp for another preview pic."
