function: "This is just a 12mm sphere. What's the big deal? Well, I made it in TinkerCad and TinkerCad does not have a sphere tool... yet. No, it is not perfect, but it may be usable. No, I haven't printed it out yet, as it looks like I need a new extruder board. But, once I have one and am back up and running this is early on my list.\r\n\r\nShare and enjoy!\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad.
