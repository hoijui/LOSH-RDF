function = "I needed a new phone stand. The one I designed for my Samsung Moment just doesn't work well with my HTC EVO 3D. \r\n\r\nThe bump out is to stop the speaker from being covered up despite which way the phone may be oriented. Plus, it adds a little style to it, instead of just an easel, or podium for my phone.\r\n\r\nShare and Enjoy!"
