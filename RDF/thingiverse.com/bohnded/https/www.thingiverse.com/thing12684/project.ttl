    okh:function """Remembering the fir trees tc_fea created early in the year, I figured this could be applied to hair. So, I did this little experiment. This is one of my TCad spheres, 12mm wide with a slightly Brainiac looking face added to it, with no mouth. The results look as though the hair may be blowing in the wind. It seems this would work much better on a larger scale head. This experiment, for me, is a success. Feel free to play with the source file on TinkerCad (listed below) to see what was done to get this effect.\r
