This was printed in glow in the dark ABS and the chrome/silver was painted on with a paint pen. The drill bit snaps into the base. It took about and hour and a half to print with a 50% fill. It has not been sanded or touched up at all... didn't even cut off the burrs.  
This part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc0476f1285eca1/64""" ;
