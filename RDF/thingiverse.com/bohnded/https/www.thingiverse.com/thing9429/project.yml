function: "This is a revised version of my very inaccurate Ennis Brown House tile. (As seen in Blade Runner and about a dozen plus other movies and TV shows.) I think this one is much better than my previous version.\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc067c9c1a18c5e"
