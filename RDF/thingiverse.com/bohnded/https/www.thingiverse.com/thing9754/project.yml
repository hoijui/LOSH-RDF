function: "My teenage daughter is working on a \"steam punk\" costume, so I volunteered to make some goggles for her. The first printout was sloppy in areas due to overhang, but it was easy to clean up with a little clipping and cutting. It was a good proof of concept anyway. This is an updated version that should address the overhang issues.\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc02f92ab75127b"
