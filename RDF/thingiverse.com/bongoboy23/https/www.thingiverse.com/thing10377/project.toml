function = "I have changed one major thing and several minor things on the original design.\r\n\r\nMajor change - The original gear on the Makerbot meant for gripping the plastic can be used on this extruder. This translates to superb grip compared to using only the screw's threads to grip the plastic.\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n-Flipped the mount, so Stepper motor doesn't run out of cable length.\r\n-Extruder holes moved, mounts DIRECTLY onto the Makerbot.\r\n-Small gear center hole larger to fit on Makerbot's Stepstruder motor.\r\n\r\nThe increased grip added to the geared extruder means you can get up to some nice speeds on your Makerbot!\r\n\r\nBetter Pictures coming soon!"
