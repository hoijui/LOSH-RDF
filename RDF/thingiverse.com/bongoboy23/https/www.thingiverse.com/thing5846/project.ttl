    okh:function """I kept having problems with big prints shifting on the automated build platform, and I heard it might be because the belt isnt completely attached to the platform. So what I did was create flaps that went over the belt to keep it from moving upward during a print. I have attached them, but have yet to print out a large object. (Also, I have only printed out the middle ones for use, but I also made ones to go on the corners)\r
\r
I have prints for the middle screws, BLFR (Back-left, Front-right), and BRFL (Back-right, Front-left). Print whichever ones you want depending on where you want to attach the flaps.\r
\r
NOTE: These flaps COVER PART OF THE BUILD PLATFORM. While it is a very small amount, make sure your prints are small enough that the extruder wont run into these.\r
\r
EDIT: Someone mentioned that this might stick to the belt after awhile because of the heat. If this happens to me, I will be sure to post it. Also, because the build platform doesn't get as high as the extruder does, only around 125C, I believe it should be fine. Only concern I would have is it might eventually warp from heating/cooling alot.""" ;
