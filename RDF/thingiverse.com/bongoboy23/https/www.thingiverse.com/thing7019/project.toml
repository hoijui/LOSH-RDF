Lid hooks on solar panel and slides down, which you can then screw in. Use any screw you feel fits, I just made the holes on for the lid to act as lead holes for drilling out better holes.\r\n\r\nTo fit everything:\r\nMake sure to get rid of alot of the extra solar panel cable, all that extra cable wont fit in the box. Put in the electronics first, then battery on top, then slide the solar panel over top. (may need to be jiggle around to get everything to sit snug).\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nThe lid has built in support for the small flaps that slide into the top of the box. Should be able to snip and twist off, some sanding may be needed.\r\n\r\nUPDATE(3/15/2011):\r\nMore pictures added for assembly help."
