\r
I didn't like putting it in an altoid case and having to stick the solar panel on the outside, so designed a simple case to hold everything.\r
\r
The inner walls are to keep things from sliding around, if you dont want to glue stuff down. Lid hooks on solar panel and slides down, which you can then screw in. Use any screw you feel fits, I just made the holes on for the lid to act as lead holes for drilling out better holes.\r
\r
To fit everything:\r
Make sure to get rid of alot of the extra solar panel cable, all that extra cable wont fit in the box. Put in the electronics first, then battery on top, then slide the solar panel over top. (may need to be jiggle around to get everything to sit snug).\r
\r
NOTE:\r
The lid has built in support for the small flaps that slide into the top of the box. Should be able to snip and twist off, some sanding may be needed.\r
\r
UPDATE(3/15/2011):\r
More pictures added for assembly help.""" ;
