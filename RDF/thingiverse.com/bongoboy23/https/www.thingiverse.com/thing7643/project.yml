function: "Looking for some way to get back at that jerk in the cubicle over? Want to build a legal weapon for self defense?\r\n\r\nI introduce to you, the amazing Disk Shooter! With Auto-Reloading capabilities, exchangeable magazines, and a custom machined handle, this weapon of mass destruction will have your coworkers shaking in their shoes!\r\n\r\nBUILD YOURS TODAY!\r\n\r\nUPDATE 4/16/2011:\r\nAdded a new slide, main barrel, and auto-reload base files in a zip.\r\nCHANGES:\r\n-Slide cut down on sides\r\n-Main barrel has catches on the back to prevent slide from coming out the back (Have to load slide through top of barrel, then it won't slide too far forward or backwards)\r\n-Main barrel to Auto-reload base connection changed, now meant to be screwed on, should fit with M3 screws.\r\n\r\n-If requested, will upload old version of main barrel with ONLY catches added on, without the screw add-on"
