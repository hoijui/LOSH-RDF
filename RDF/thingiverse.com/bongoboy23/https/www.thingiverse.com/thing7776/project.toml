The first is the spool was too small, so my filament would just unwind itself. The second was that I didn't have any rods to go between the spools. Finally, the hole in the middle was too small for the rod I wanted to but it on.\r\n\r\nSo what did I do? \r\nMade it extend-able, so the size of the spool can be changed.\r\nMade the center hole bigger.\r\nMade it so I could attached printable hooks to hold the plastic onto the spool (and made them double, so that it would hold more plastic!)\r\n\r\nAND, to save myself some plastic, I made the ends with connectors so you can attach them and hopefully get more plastic onto less spools."
