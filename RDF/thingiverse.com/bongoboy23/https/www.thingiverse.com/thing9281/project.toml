function = "This is a simple tension locking mechanism. \r\n\r\nWith the new MK6's ability for rapid reversal, the simple tension screw would gradually jiggle lose. And while I know there are several different designs for the new extruders that prevent this, I did not want to take a bunch of time to print and replace the old acrylic frame.\r\n\r\nSolution? Design a lock system to prevent the screw from coming lose!\r\n10 minutes to design, 30 minutes to print the pieces, and my quick fix is ready and working!"
