function = "This is a switch and outlet coverplate generator.  Sorry, North American only.  It will need to be flipped upside down to be printable.  Unfortunately, a typical coverplate is just outside the print volume of a Makerbot.  You may need to double check the measurements before you print.\r\n\r\nIt could also be easily adapted to work for ethernet, coax, telephone, etc."
