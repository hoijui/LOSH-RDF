function: "Although it has been updated I liked this original design. As stated in its documentation you need to adapt it for your own use. I needed it for a MakerBot with an MK4 hotend. I know there a few adapter plates out there but I decided to go for an integral design.\r\nI had been using a Brutstruder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4036 which in turn uses Zaggo's Printable Extruder Holder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1912 and having good luck so I decided to go along these lines in adapting this.\r\n\r\nAdditional info on this and driver circuit board at: http://bot719.com/"
