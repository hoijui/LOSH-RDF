function: "These are end stops which work with limit switches I mounted to my mill to control the x-axis power feed. They work with a standard T-Track which is widely available. I made up some spring loaded bolts which provide plenty of holding power and are easy to adjust by pushing to release and sliding to the left or right.\r\nThe \"base\" of this could easily be adapted for use with router tables, tablesaw miter gauges or anything else with an integral T-Track to create other useful jigs.\r\nI have included the OpenSCAD files and commented them so someone can identify the main body and add or remove sections to meet their needs."
