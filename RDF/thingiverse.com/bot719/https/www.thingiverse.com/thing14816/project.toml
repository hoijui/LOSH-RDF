function = "Here is a switch mount for a Mini Lathe with an autostop I designed (see 2nd photo).\r\nI am putting this out here but I realize it is a very specific application and probably not of much use to others.\r\nThe stop is spring loaded and has a clamping effect. It holds very well and is easy to adjust.\r\nThe photos at the bottom were failed prints but work for showing how it's put together. The final product is much better quality but I forgot to take pictures before assembling it."
