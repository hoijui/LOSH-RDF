function = "Another Tablet stand.\r\nI wanted to design my own and didn't care about portability. My main concern was stability. I needed the upright pieces wide enough to be able to add some type of stick on feet that would grip a surface. The idea being the tablet wouldn't slide around when pressing on it.\r\nThis was printed on an early MakerBot and the uprights push it's printable area limit."
