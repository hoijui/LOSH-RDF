I found the previous version had problems where the gauge would get bumped out of alignment during use and was best removed when not in use. This solves both issues and gives digital accuracy as well.\r
You need to trim off pieces of the caliper as shown so the polycarbonite ones are nice. You could use a standard stainless steel one of course, but the cutting will be more difficult.\r
OpenSCAD file included if you need to make adjustments.""" ;
