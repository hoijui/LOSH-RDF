function = "This is my first OpenScad project and it is for a swivel light fixture I will use for a future mod. I'll be documenting it here http://bot719.com/. \r\nThis is my first posting to Thingiverse and I imagine this is not the first such type fixture created. If it closely resembles a current posting it is unintended. If anyone feels it does please let me know and I will do what I can to rectify this. Since I am not aware of any and started from scratch I am setting it as a new thing."
