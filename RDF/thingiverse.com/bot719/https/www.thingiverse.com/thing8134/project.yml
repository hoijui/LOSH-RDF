function: "Update: There is a new thing which uses a digital caliper. It's more compact, more stable and easier to read.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17970\r\nThis is about as simple a thing as I can imagine. But it serves a purpose for those with a 7 x 12 lathe so here it is.\r\nI have seen several examples of this solution for determining drilling depth with a lathe. In each case the operator used aluminum or acrylic or some other material which required machining. I was thinking along the same lines, digging through scrap stock when it dawned on me I could print it.\r\nI guess the point is when you are modifying a lathe you think to machine a part. When you need a jig for a table saw you think to cut it from plywood or MDF.\r\nBeing able to print something opens up a whole new way of thinking about how to solution things."
