function: This is a version of the Dual Replicator fan guard that has a breeze deflector under the fans.  Some have found the misdirected air from the fans blow on the work.  This then exacerbates any warping problems.  Some have been using Kapton tape to fix this.  This will do the same thing in a cleaner package.  (This is all in reference to printing with ABS plastic).
