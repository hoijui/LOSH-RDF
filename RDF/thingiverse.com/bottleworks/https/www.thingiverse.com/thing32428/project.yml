function: 'This is to make a #41 drive chain (almost).  The width is for 1/8" sprokets, but it''s otherwise #41 spec.  I made this to use for the Lyman Filament Extruder.  The stress on the chain is too much for it.  This chain can take a fair bit of pull, but the extruder was just too much.  Maybe someone has a use for this.'
