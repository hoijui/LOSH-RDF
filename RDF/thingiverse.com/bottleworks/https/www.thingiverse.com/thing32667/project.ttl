\r
This version has a:\r
1.  Larger Hot end with 350 Watt heater\r
2.  Automatic timing system\r
3.  fan ducting\r
4.  Modified sprokets and hopper\r
5.  Adjustable motor speed on the control panel.  \r
\r
Basics of how it works:\r
Flip on the main switch.  This turns on the cooling fan.  Then press the red Momentary pushbutton.  This activates a 1 second timer that gets latched on and begins the motor timer set for 20 minutes.  The latched 1 second timer powers the relay that powers the PID.  I used the 1 second timer because I wanted the control mechanics as I made them.  Unnecessarily complex, but it's what I wanted.  \r
\r
If you take a look at the parts I used, you might see a lot of dollar signs.  The parts that I used were mostly free.  I endup collecting a lot of stuff that gets deemed "broken" or otherwise would have been thrown away.""" ;
