function: "This is my version of the \"LYMAN FILAMENT EXTRUDER\".  \r\n\r\nThis version has a:\r\n1.  Larger Hot end with 350 Watt heater\r\n2.  Automatic timing system\r\n3.  fan ducting\r\n4.  Modified sprokets and hopper\r\n5.  Adjustable motor speed on the control panel.  \r\n\r\nBasics of how it works:\r\nFlip on the main switch.  This turns on the cooling fan.  Then press the red Momentary pushbutton.  This activates a 1 second timer that gets latched on and begins the motor timer set for 20 minutes.  The latched 1 second timer powers the relay that powers the PID.  I used the 1 second timer because I wanted the control mechanics as I made them.  Unnecessarily complex, but it's what I wanted.  \r\n\r\nIf you take a look at the parts I used, you might see a lot of dollar signs.  The parts that I used were mostly free.  I endup collecting a lot of stuff that gets deemed \"broken\" or otherwise would have been thrown away."
