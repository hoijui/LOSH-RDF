function = "I'm wiring up my air compressor (it's been close to 4 years just waiting after we moved).  When I went to Lowes there was only one option for a plug cover.  It didn't seem quite right at the store, but it was the only one I could find.  As soon as I opened it up, it was clear that I got the wrong one.  So, I made this adapter to solve the problem."
