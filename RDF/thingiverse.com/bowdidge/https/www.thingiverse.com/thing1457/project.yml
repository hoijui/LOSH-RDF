function: This is a set of three Makerbot-printable objects that can be used for making models of Spanish Revival-style buildings.  I'm using these to build an HO (1/87) scale model of a 1920's era Drive-in Public Market (or what we'd call a strip mall.)  The main piece is an arched wall section that's 25.5 scale feet high and 20 feet wide (about 90 mm x 70 mm).  There's also a smaller piece with the same roofline intended for a tower, and a third piece for a storefront.
