function = "I was getting tired of forgetting to download files from things. I also like to always have the original files in git so that if I move or scale things in replicatorg, I can always go back to the originals if I want. And last, I like to have the directory names with the original thing number embedded, so I can easily go back to the thing page for reference.\r\n\r\nTo solve all these problems, I wrote a small, very hackish bash script. You tell this script the Thing #, and it will take care of the rest. First, it finds the name of the Thing from the title of the thing page. It creates a directory by that name, initializes a new git repository, and downloads all files attached to the thing.\r\n\r\nThis script works on the several dozen things I've downloaded so far.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- The way I parse out the download numbers is somewhat hacky. This should use something like the thing#/files URL and some actual DOM parsing.\r\n\r\n- Somebody should pester the Thingiverse maintainers to get an actual API to get the URLs of all the downloads\r\n\r\n- It would also be nice if thingiverse were more github-like for file storage"
