function: "Github repo at: https://github.com/superchalupa/container-round-decorative\r\n\r\nI really liked MakeALot's Spiro Coaster and his Bracelet V, so I decided to mash them up into a container.\r\n\r\nIt's completely parametric... change the height, width, wall thickness, oval cutout number/size/angle.\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of lid: one with a latch and a pin, and one with two latches. The lid with the pin is not removable, it pivots out of the way.\r\n\r\nAlso included as a bonus, a completely parametric bracelet design that you can size to your liking.\r\n\r\nUpdate: after printing, I've made a few tweaks\r\nVersion 1.1 changes:\r\n -- the latched lid gets a detent ring for positive retention\r\n -- for some reason difference()-ing the lid from the container makes a non-manifold design, so I build the container a different way\r\n -- split out all of the files to allow a bit more fine-grained reuse."
