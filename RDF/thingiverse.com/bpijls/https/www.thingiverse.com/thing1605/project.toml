function = "I have always found the shape of this glass to be very interesting so I decided to model it in order to print it. While it was printing, I turned to Google to find more information on the glass. It seems that it was designed in 1927 and described as \"...the ultimate drinking vessel created by man, and of its type cannot be improved.\" ( http://www.patricktaylor.com/duralex-picardie )\r\n\r\nI also found out that the Duralex factory almost closed a few years ago. Modelling and printing objects like this can save shapes from extinction in the future."
