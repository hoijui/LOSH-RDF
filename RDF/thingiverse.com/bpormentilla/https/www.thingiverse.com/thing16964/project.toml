function = "Have an iPad or iPad 2? Or perhaps a tablet PC that you love to carry around but lack the hardware to keep it upright when surfing the web or reading an e-book? Look no further! This elegantly designed tablet stand is the ideal solution.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of its design gains inspiration from three identically-sized spheres that encircle a central sphere to produce a sturdy stand. The material is made out of durable ivory-gloss polyurethane with soft rubber protrusions that act as \"grips\" to keep your iPad or tablet PC in place.\r\n\r\nThe set comes with two sphericals that can be positioned anywhere on the tablet's base in either the vertical or horizontal position, whichever best suites your needs."
