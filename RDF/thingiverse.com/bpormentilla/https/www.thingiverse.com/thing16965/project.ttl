This is a concept that I came up with when I wanted to design my own bookmark. I'm an avid reader and resorted to using Post-It notes to bookmark my novels and textbooks. After a while I realized that it was a very practical approach, but not at all aesthetically pleasing to the eye. So given my innate desire to design and create, I knew that the only sensible thing to do was to design my own product, one that could not be purchased at a bookstore or ordered online. I wanted authenticity.\r
\r
It had to be functional yet elegant, simple yet creative. And after some initial design sketches, I finally came up with the Tree Origins bookmark. As seen in the item picture, it is designed to resemble a tree in an abstract way. Although seemingly organic in its shape, the geometry is actually quite symmetrical. The disparate nature of its design is what makes the idea work.\r
\r
I produce this bookmark using a flexible and resilient high-gloss PVC plastic material.The flexible property enables it to easily 'squeeze' pages together to produce a firm hold.\r
\r
If you like the design, please spread the love =)""" ;
