function: "* UPDATE : I uploaded a new file with design elements that help to strengthen the individual branches of the tree. Check out the file \"tree_new.stl\"\r\n\r\nThis is a concept that I came up with when I wanted to design my own bookmark. I'm an avid reader and resorted to using Post-It notes to bookmark my novels and textbooks. After a while I realized that it was a very practical approach, but not at all aesthetically pleasing to the eye. So given my innate desire to design and create, I knew that the only sensible thing to do was to design my own product, one that could not be purchased at a bookstore or ordered online. I wanted authenticity.\r\n\r\nIt had to be functional yet elegant, simple yet creative. And after some initial design sketches, I finally came up with the Tree Origins bookmark. As seen in the item picture, it is designed to resemble a tree in an abstract way. Although seemingly organic in its shape, the geometry is actually quite symmetrical. The disparate nature of its design is what makes the idea work.\r\n\r\nI produce this bookmark using a flexible and resilient high-gloss PVC plastic material.The flexible property enables it to easily 'squeeze' pages together to produce a firm hold.\r\n\r\nIf you like the design, please spread the love =)"
