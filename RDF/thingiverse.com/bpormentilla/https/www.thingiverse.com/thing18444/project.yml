function: "About a week ago one of my friends told me that he was driving to SF from SD and he was having issues with mounting his phone on his dashboard. He asked me if I could design a smartphone stand for use while driving (navigation purposes of course), kinda like a dashboard mount used for GPS devices.\r\n\r\nI got to work and this is what I came up with. It has an extendable arm that varies in length depending on the dowel insert location, and it can swivel on a 180-deg angle based on the tightening knob.\r\n\r\nI am currently printing the parts using a Solido SD300 Pro, a printer that uses thin slices of PVC material to produce the finished product. If you guys have any suggestions as to how to improve the overall design, please feel free to comment =)\r\n\r\nOh and right now this only houses iPhones but I am working on several other smartphone configurations... So hang tight!\r\n\r\nThis is an OPEN SOURCE project, so if you guys happen to modify any of the parts to accommodate your smartphones then please feel free to share =)"
