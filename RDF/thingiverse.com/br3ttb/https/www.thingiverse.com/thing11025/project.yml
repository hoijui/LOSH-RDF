function: "(Note:  There's now a better, tapered version.  I recommend that you print this instead: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12348)\r\n\r\nI was ashamed Thingiverse. So ashamed.  I presented the Mighty Bottle Opener as the pocket equivalent to Starno's Coin-Op.  It wasn't.  It isn't.  I just wasn't able to find a reliable way to protect the plastic.\r\n\r\nIt works really well if printed in PLA, but for the vast majority of users it's an annoying chewed-up mess.\r\n\r\nWELL NO MORE!  After months of self recrimination, I went back to the drawing board, and have come back with a beefier \"church key\" design.\r\n\r\nTwo things that make me confident in this design:\r\n1 - I've used it to open several bottles with ease. (Gasp!)\r\n2 - I took the time to make the model fully parametric.  If it's not strong enough for you, you can make it 10 inches thick! (not recommended)\r\n\r\nAnother benefit to the parametric model is that it can be adjusted to fit the coin of your choice.  (See the attached image for some of what can be specified.  When I say \"fully parametric\" I mean FULLY)\r\n\r\nMighty Opener: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9350\r\nStarno's Coin-Op: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1842\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  I've added the ability to sexify the opener with a makerbot M.  Just set the \"UseBadge\" flag in the scad.  if you'd like to use an M in your own OpenSCAD part, I've broken out the module I used to draw my M into its own thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11105\r\n\r\nUPDATE #2:  These things make great gifts.  With a little tweaking you can print a custom design instead of the M.  I've detailed the process here: http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/09/making-a-custom-bottle-opener/"
