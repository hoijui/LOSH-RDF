function: "I doubt if this will ever be duplicated. (UPDATE: I stand corrected) But just in case, here you go.  I got married recently, and one of my geek duties for the wedding was to light 75 paper lanterns in the reception tent.\r\n\r\nCommercially available solutions advertise a 12 hour life, which is much too short.  So I designed something that uses 2 AA batteries to power 3 LEDs. \r\n\r\n...it may have been overkill.  It's been almost 4 weeks and these things are still going.\r\n\r\nfor more detailed information on motivation / construction check out: http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/08/when-a-maker-gets-married/"
