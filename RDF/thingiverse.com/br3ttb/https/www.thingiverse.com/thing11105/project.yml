function: "I recently designed a bottle opener ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11025) in OpenSCAD, and I wanted to sexify it with a Makerbot M.  Searching thingiverse I was unable to find native OpenSCAD code that did what I wanted.  I either needed to import an STL, extrude a dxf, or install a font.\r\n\r\n...so I made a MakerbotM module.  Rather than just bury it in the Bottle Opener's .scad file, I've broken it out here for others to enjoy.\r\n\r\nUPDATED:  I encorporated tbuser's changes (more faces on the cylinder) as well as extended the middle leg up into the body of the M, removing some occasional weirdness that was happening during differences."
