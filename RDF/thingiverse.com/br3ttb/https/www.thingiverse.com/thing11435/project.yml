function: "I recently shared a design that lets you mount your phone to a gorillapod.  I was (and am) really proud of the design, but it's a pretty niche thing.\r\n\r\nThis design is more universal. It makes use of a standard 1/4-20 nut and lets your phone be mounted to any tripod (including the gorillapod)\r\n\r\nThe model is fully parametric as before, so you can specify the dimensions of your phone, as well as that of the nut. as with the previous design, if you get dimensions that work with your phone, please comment.  I'll upload an STL so that subsequent users won't need to play around with openSCAD."
