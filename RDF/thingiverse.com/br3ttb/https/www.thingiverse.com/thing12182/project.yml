function: "I needed a new profile image.  While I'm proud of the project that lead to my former \"TV face\" image, it didn't really say \"Thingiverse\"\r\n\r\nHaving just successfully created a 3 color bottle opener, I knew the time for a multi-color portrait had come.\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at mashing colors together on the same layer like this.  I'm really happy with the results.  Hopefully others will take this technique and run with it.  Turns out you don't need dual extruders to make a multi-colored part!\r\n\r\ntv-face: http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/tag/hdtv-mount/\r\n3 color opener: http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/09/three-color-3d-print/"
