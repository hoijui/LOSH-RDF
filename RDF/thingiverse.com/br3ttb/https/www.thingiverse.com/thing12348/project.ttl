\r
The thickness, coin-size, and taper are all adjustable in the scad.  I didn't bother to test changing the other variables as I'm pretty happy with that geometry.\r

Bonus:  Are you full of jealousy seeing all these dualstrusion parts popping up everywhere?  well now you can stick it to the man with a three color bottle opener!""" ;
