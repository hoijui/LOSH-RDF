function: "I thought the Pocket Coin-op would look nicer with some tapered edges.  the rounding also makes the opener lighter and speeds up the print a little.\r\n\r\nThe thickness, coin-size, and taper are all adjustable in the scad.  I didn't bother to test changing the other variables as I'm pretty happy with that geometry.\r\n\r\nBonus:  Are you full of jealousy seeing all these dualstrusion parts popping up everywhere?  well now you can stick it to the man with a three color bottle opener!"
