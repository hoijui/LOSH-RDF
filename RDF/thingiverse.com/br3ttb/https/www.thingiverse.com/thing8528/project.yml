function: "This is inspired by a recent post showing how you could use a credit or membership card as an earbud holder. ( www.unplggd.com/unplggd/turn-old-credit-cards-into-earbud-holders-146446 )\r\n\r\nI loved the concept, but felt the design could be improved. This design significantly reduces the time it takes to wrap and unwrap.  You wrap the long way, and the over-wrap locks things in quickly.  The big speed improvement though, is on removal.  As soon and you remove the over-wrap the entire cord bundle just slides off.\r\n\r\nAs an afterthought, I noticed that there's a nice area for business card-y stuff"
