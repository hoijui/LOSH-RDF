    okh:function """UPDATE:  I've been unable to find a reliable way to protect the plastic with this design.  If you're using PLA, keep reading; people have had good results.  If you're printing with ABS however, I recommend using this updated design: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11025\r
\r
The Coin-Op Bottle Opener ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1842 ) is awesome on so many levels.  No wonder it's often the first thing that gets printed on a new machine.  It doesn't take long to see its weakness though:  it's HUGE.\r
\r
This design keeps the same (strong, satisfying) jaw geometry, but puts it in a package that isn't a burden on your pants pocket.  Also, because it's much smaller, it takes FAR less time to print.\r
\r
One drawback is that you need to man-handle a paper clip to keep the plastic from getting chewed up. On the plus side you get to call yourself "crafty."\r
\r
Also I removed most of the handle, so you may have to adjust your normal hand position.  I find this opener works best with my thumb on top, index finger underneath.\r
\r
(I've left this as a "work in progress" for the time being.  It has done well in my testing, but please let me know if something doesn't work for you)\r
\r
History:\r
- Part gets submitted using a modified bottle cap as the protector.  looks awesome (it's still the title thumbnail)\r
- Thing gets featured.\r
- Turns out the bottle cap protector doesn't work all that well.  Embarrassing update posted. (good thing it's a "work in progress")\r
- Furious design session yeilds improved paper clip design. (thanks go out to thingiverse users waaronw and jprodgers for their contributions to that process)\r
- Made the part ~1mm wider (to help the fill around the hole) and added a little recess for the paperclip on the back side.""" ;
