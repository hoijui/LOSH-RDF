function: "UPDATE:  I've been unable to find a reliable way to protect the plastic with this design.  If you're using PLA, keep reading; people have had good results.  If you're printing with ABS however, I recommend using this updated design: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11025\r\n\r\nThe Coin-Op Bottle Opener ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1842 ) is awesome on so many levels.  No wonder it's often the first thing that gets printed on a new machine.  It doesn't take long to see its weakness though:  it's HUGE.\r\n\r\nThis design keeps the same (strong, satisfying) jaw geometry, but puts it in a package that isn't a burden on your pants pocket.  Also, because it's much smaller, it takes FAR less time to print.\r\n\r\nOne drawback is that you need to man-handle a paper clip to keep the plastic from getting chewed up. On the plus side you get to call yourself \"crafty.\"\r\n\r\nAlso I removed most of the handle, so you may have to adjust your normal hand position.  I find this opener works best with my thumb on top, index finger underneath.\r\n\r\n(I've left this as a \"work in progress\" for the time being.  It has done well in my testing, but please let me know if something doesn't work for you)\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\n- Part gets submitted using a modified bottle cap as the protector.  looks awesome (it's still the title thumbnail)\r\n- Thing gets featured.\r\n- Turns out the bottle cap protector doesn't work all that well.  Embarrassing update posted. (good thing it's a \"work in progress\")\r\n- Furious design session yeilds improved paper clip design. (thanks go out to thingiverse users waaronw and jprodgers for their contributions to that process)\r\n- Made the part ~1mm wider (to help the fill around the hole) and added a little recess for the paperclip on the back side."
