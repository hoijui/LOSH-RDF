function = "I, like Mario Batali and most school children, own a pair of crocs.  Mine are lined and are great for walking the dog in cold weather.  \r\n\r\nI've often wondered why they would intentionally leave those iconic holes open on the top. These things are supposed to be keeping me warm!  My guess is that they wanted me fill them with those charms they sell, thereby giving them some extra money.\r\n\r\nWell 3D printing to the rescue!  I made myself a nice set of spikes to plug those holes, and I got to keep my money.\r\n\r\nI doubt anyone will want their own set of croc spikes, but there MAY be some interest in using the base to make derivatives.  These charms are a quick print (5-10min.)  What a nice thing to give to a young kid to get them excited about 3D printing.  Maybe the makerbot M? or, um... a bunny rabbit? ...the bust of Colbert?"
