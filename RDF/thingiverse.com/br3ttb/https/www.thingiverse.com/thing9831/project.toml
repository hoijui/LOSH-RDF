function = "You know... for kids!\r\n\r\nI had a couple long flights recently and I thought I'd play around with a couple croc charm designs based on the shoe spikes I posted last month.\r\n\r\nSame motivation as before:  I'm not interested in adorning my crocs; not my thing.  Kids, on the other hand, love this kind of stuff.  Getting something on their feet that gets them thinking about making instead of buying is a worthwhile endeavor.\r\n\r\nThese are quick prints that should be able to hold any kid's attention and get a some good Q&A flowing."
