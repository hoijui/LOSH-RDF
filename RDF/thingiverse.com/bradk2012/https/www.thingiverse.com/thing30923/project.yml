function: I decided that before I lose the spare parts and allen wrenches that came with the MakerBot Replicator I would build a tool holder that attaches to the frame. It holds the 5 wrenches and includes a removable cup that you can keep small parts in. If you don't want the cup, the opening works well for putting pliers, etc in.
