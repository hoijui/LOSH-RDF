function = "My wife wanted a 7\" tablet to fit in her purse, but also wanted an attachable keyboard that we only saw on the 10\" tablets.  So we got her a 7\" Acer Iconia A110 tablet and a Motorola KZ500 BlueTooth keyboard.  We then printed a bracket that clips onto the keyboard and holds it in place while she types.\r\n\r\nProbably other similar stuff out there, but I've been antsy to try something functional on my Printrbot drafted in Alibre Design."
