function = "This is a plastic bushing/slider used to hang doors in Arrow sheds (two per door).  I noticed ours were worn away to next to nothing, and used the remaining pieces to design a replacement.  The sliders can be purchased as part of a \"tune up kit\" from the manufacturer here (http://www.sheds.com/miva/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=DK100&Category_Code=A), or you can save $15 and print your own.\r\n\r\nAt its simplest the design is an extruded \"H\" where the top and bottom slide along folded sheet metal guides.  Like the original part, the insides of the pathway narrow down to provide less wiggle.\r\n\r\nAside from the guide pins (placed on both sides so that the piece can be used in left and right orientations), there is also a through and through screw hole."
