function: "A super lightweight stool with a 3D printed structure and carbon-fiber shell.  \n\nThe shape of the Gaudi Stool was created in the same way that Spanish Art Noveau architect Antoni Gaudi designed the structure of his churches, by making a model of hanging chains, so letting gravity determine the strongest and most logical shape for withstanding forces.  \n\nCarbon-fiber and 3D printing were used to be able to apply Gaudi's methods in lightweight furniture.  \n\nWhen a chain hangs in between two supports, it will follow a line defined by gravity. This is the catenary. When this line is reversed, a strong form for taking compressive forces emerges."
