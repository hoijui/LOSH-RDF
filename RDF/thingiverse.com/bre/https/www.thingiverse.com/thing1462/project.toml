function = "Since I am giving a presentation at a conference with the subtitle \"Here be dragons\" I knew I had to print dragons.\r\n\r\nI've managed to cut the head off the open dragon from here:http://www.cgarena.com/freestuff/meshes/meshes.html\r\n\r\nBut it's not a clean cut and I'm not terribly good at editing models so if someone wants to improve the cut, I'll reupload the model.\r\n\r\nUpdate! Nate True fixed up the model. I've added a second file called \"dragonheadfixed\" that you'll want to use from now on. Thanks Nate!"
