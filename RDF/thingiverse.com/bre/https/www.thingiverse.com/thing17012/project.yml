function: "I looked into getting lead shot for the weight on a mechanical clock and it turned out to be cheaper to use pennies. This should hold about 2.5 pounds ($4) of pennies with some room to add more if you need to.\r\n\r\nNote: To stay under the 150mm height limit of the Replicator you'll have to use the shorter stl file."
