function: "This is the first of my flatpack action figures. I've made lots of prototypes so that the tolerances are really tight and they basically snap together. If by chance you force it to much and it breaks, it is easy to fix it with a drop of superglue.\r\n\r\nThe MK-1 is a monkey on a mission to defeat the evil kitten empire.\r\n\r\nWith cymbals to clang and a knife and fork to eat with, the MK-1 is accessorized to make some noise and eat some dinner.\r\n\r\nA prehensile tail means that it can carry the accessories in it's tail too!\r\n\r\nOne very special thing about this monkey is that you can hold it up to the light to see the skull inside it's head.\r\n\r\nThese are not for small children because they have small parts that are rather sharp."
