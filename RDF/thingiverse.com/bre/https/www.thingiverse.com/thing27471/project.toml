function = "7 years ago my dad pulled me aside and asked what I would like to have gifted to me in his will. I asked for this Buddha statue that's been in my family since I was born. My dad blinked and then just handed it to me and said, \"Here you go, why wait?\" It's a simple Buddha figure with simple lines. The scan didn't turn out that good, but it'll do for now. I'll scan it again when Autodesk comes out with a new version of 123D Catch."
