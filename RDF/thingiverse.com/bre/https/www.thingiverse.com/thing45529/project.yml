function: I wanted to print this but there were holes in the mesh everywhere and the wheels weren't attached. I had to take off the wing and the door handles. The wheels are nothing special, but I broke them out. Really someone needs to make some awesome wheels for this, or you can scale it to Matchbox/Hotwheel size and attach them.
