function = "I grabbed this from Google Earth, which has a very nice open license and it really needs some changes to print well.\r\n\r\nMy approach with the SKP or KMZ files is to work with them in the free version of sketchup and then use my trial version of sketchup pro to export them. Because I have 8 hours of trial time on the pro and it only takes a minute to export them, that works for me.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to create a derivative and go in and make the book go all the way down to her hip, that would help make it so that it wouldn\\'t start printing in mid air."
