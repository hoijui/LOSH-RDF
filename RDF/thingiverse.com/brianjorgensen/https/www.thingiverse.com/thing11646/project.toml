function = "Much has been said about the automated build platform currently distributed with the Makerbot Thing-o-matic. I like it, but frankly, it doesn't work out of the box nearly as well as the rest of the bot. My acrylic ABP v2 sides both cracked within minutes of installation, so I've been searching for a solution ever since.\r\n\r\nThis is DEFINITELY a work in progress, but I'm currently using two of them as ToM parts :) I basically use it as an elevated HBP while I work on fixing the damn thing to be a proper ABP."
