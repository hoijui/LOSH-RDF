I like it, but frankly, it doesn't work out of the box nearly as well as the rest of the bot. My acrylic ABP v2 sides both cracked within minutes of installation, so I've been searching for a solution ever since.\r
\r
This is DEFINITELY a work in progress, but I'm currently using two of them as ToM parts :) I basically use it as an elevated HBP while I work on fixing the damn thing to be a proper ABP.""" ;
