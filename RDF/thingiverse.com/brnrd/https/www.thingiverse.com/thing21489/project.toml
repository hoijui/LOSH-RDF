function = "This bracket allows the Azteeg X1 controller to be mounted in the bottom frame of the Prusa Mendel iteration 2. This version is for a Prusa with the z motor mounted in the bottom instead of the top. The SCAD file is parametric so it can easily be edited for a standard Prusa or for a Sanguinololu controller. It includes mounting holes for future cooling fan bracket."
