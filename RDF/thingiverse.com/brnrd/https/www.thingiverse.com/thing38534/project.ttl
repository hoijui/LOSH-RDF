    okh:function """Inspired by DaleDunn's elegant solution for z wobble on the Prusa (Thing 20147), I designed a version for the Ord Bot Hadron. This should also work on the Quantum assuming there's enough clearance.\r
\r
There are two versions: One uses the z nuts that came with the Ord Bot Kit and the other uses M8 nuts. A plastic washer might be needed between the two parts to minimize change in z height due to bent threaded rods.\r
\r
***Update***: The upper piece was too long and it was hitting the z endstop switch on the gantry. So, I deleted the bad files and uploaded the modified files.\r

Photo shows comparison of 20mm square x 100 mm tall single wall print with the wobble suppressor (left) and without (right). There was significant z screw wobble with rigid metal Ord Bot z coupler used in this test.\r
\r

The remaining z wobble was due to friction between one of the z nut holders and the post. After sanding it down to allow them to slide freely, z wobble was completely eliminated as shown on the photo.""" ;
