function = "This is a redesign of my Azteeg X1 bracket for the Azteeg X3. It mounts the board under the Y axis print bed. I had to lower the position of the board well below the y belt for clearance because the X3 board is wider than the X1. A version of the STL file for the X1 and Sanguinololu is also included."
