function = "mattwj2002 noted in #reprap on 2012-03-19 that there were no printable checkers on Thingiverse, so I created a printable, stackable, mostly parameteric checker with a crown on one side. It will require good bridging. The bottom can either have a flat or domed indentation. ZGerman contributed the SCAD code for the ridges.\r\n\r\nIt needs a little more work to finish paramterization."
