    okh:function "A very plain two piece case for the AVR Butterfly.  It was designed using BRL-CAD, but STL and IGES exports are also included.  It has a cutout for the screen and a countersunk hole for the 5 way joystick.  The back panel (lid) is a simple push fit.  No screws are needed.  The case is deep enough (17mm)  to accomodate a LiPoly or other flat battery as well as the butterfly." ;
