function: "I have been putting the finishing touches on my Ecksbot build and decided to clean up the mounting scheme for the electronics.  I'm looking for portability so, I decided to mount the power supply onto the printer.  I also wanted to add more protection against accidental contact with the AC wiring than what is afforded by the barrier strip cover.  As such, I present a front cover, rear cover and mounting plate for the WW-1230A 12VDC 30A switching power supply found on Ebay.  \r\n\r\nThe design files where created with Cubify Invent and are compatible with the Ecksbot or Prusa style 3D printers.\r\n\r\nUpdate 9 Oct 2012 - Added a build plate that includes the front, rear and mounting brackets from thing:10621 - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10621"
