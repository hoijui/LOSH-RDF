function = "This is a plastic panel for mounting binding posts on to when converting a computer PSU to a bench supply.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely possible to do the conversion without this part, however this part ensures the binding posts don't short out on the case. And more importantly using this part leaves more room inside the PSU, which is normally full of other things (massive heat sink, capacitors, fans etc).\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Convert-a-Computer-ATX-Power-Supply-to-a-Lab-Power-Supply\r\nhttp://www.maplin.co.uk/terminal-posts-with-gold-plated-contacts-34720"
