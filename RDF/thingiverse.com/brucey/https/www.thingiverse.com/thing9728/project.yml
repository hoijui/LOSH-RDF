function: "This is my first experience with OpenSCAD and was made as an experiment, if anyone finds it useful then that's a bonus!\r\nThis is a derivative work of A cube by imaterialise.\r\nA hypercube is a \"shadow\" or projection of a 4 dimensional cube in 3d space; much like if you projected a 3d cube onto a 2d surface. If you're interested in the theory behind this then please consult wikipedia as I don't really understand it... looks cool though ;).\r\nI have parameterised this to enable customisation of the size of the inner and outer cubes and the thickness of the \"lines\" for the inner and outer cubes. You will also notice that the polyhedrons connecting the two cubes have triangular cross-sections; this was mainly for ease of coding (less polygons to orientate!), but also seemed neat to me at the time.\r\n\r\n(note: this is my first OpenSCAD thing so I'm not sure about the neatness and robustness of my code so any feedback would be greatly apreciated!)"
