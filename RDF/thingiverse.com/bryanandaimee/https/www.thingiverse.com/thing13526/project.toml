function = "There are quite a few fan ducts on thingiverse, but I didn't find any for a Gen7/Sanguinololu  style row of pololu drivers. So here's mine. It is sized for a 60mm fan. I'm working on an 80 mm version in case I need more oomph. (I naively bought 2A steppers before realizing that the pololu's won't do anywhere near that without serious cooling.)\r\n\r\nThe aerodynamics of this duct are very poor. I'll try a more curvy version when I get around to it."
