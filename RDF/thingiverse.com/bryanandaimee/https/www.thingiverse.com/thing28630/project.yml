function: "A contest to design a low cost DIY reprap electronics solution using through hole drivers such as the TB6560. The aim is to eliminate the Pololu driver boards and save a bundle in the process, thereby making DIY reprap electronics cost effective once more.   \n\nThe contest is finished! Winners are as follows.   \n\nFirst Prize: [Maket-city]. Once again try to combine Gen7 with TB6560AHQ.  \nhttp://cnc.maket-city.ru/index.php/cnc/gen7tm  \n\nSecond Prize: [Phoenix Electronics]. Modular and robust through-hole electronics for RepRap based around an Atmega644 main control board (OMC) and dual TB6560 driver modules (DSMs)  \n\nhttp://reprap.org/wiki/Phoenix_Electronics  \n\nThird Prize: [Sango-bc]. An evolution of Sanguinololu with some SMD components, Cortex M0.   \n\nhttp://reprap.org/wiki/Sango_bc  \n\nMore detailed scores can be viewed on the reprap wiki page."
