function: "This will hopefully be a versatile servo bracket system for robotics. I designed the holes to be spaced the same as the mounting holes on the servos and equidistant in both directions (square;)so brackets and/or servos should bolt together in many different configurations. The holes are a little closer to one of the long edges allowing a servo to be bolted on along that side directly. I don't know if that will ever be used, but I thought it might come in handy. It is sized for full size hobby servo motors. \r\n\r\nThe files are in inches, so you may need to scale them in your system. They were created in google sketchup, so if you want other file formats I can only save to formats supported by sketchup. Pictures will follow soon. The servos I have are HS-322HD, so that is what I know it fits. Hopefully it will fit other full size servos. If you have a similar size servo that doesn't work with these brackets please let me know what changes are needed to make it more universal. I have a 2 DOF quad nearly finished using these brackets so pictures of that will be forthcoming as well. I'll soon be adding a connector to enable 3 DOF arms/legs. \r\n\r\nUpdate: Connectors added for 3 DOF limbs. Also I updated the brackets to be a little longer at the end. This will help prevent the ends splitting when screwing the bracket to the horn. The \"Inside\" brackets are a little narrower to be fitted inside the horn and the \"outside\" brackets are designed to attach outside the horn.\r\n\r\nHere is the 2DOF Quad http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6321, and here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9ne67bbpSQ is a youtube video of the 2DOF walker in action. The controller is a Jaluino with a servo shield I designed myself."
