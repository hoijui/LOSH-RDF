function = "My seven year old is now collecting chess sets. I have a bunch of BNC connectors laying around. So here is a BNC chess set. There are two versions of the pawn. \r\nHave fun.\r\n\r\nUpdate: added a mock bnc connector for those who are connector deprived. It is not dimensionally correct, nor functional, but it should work as a replacement in this chess set. You probably only need it in the knight, pawn and bishop pieces. \r\n\r\nMy blog if you are interested."
