function: I needed an easy way to mount my Gen7 electronics on my Prusa printer build. I didn't want to use standoffs and bolts because I would like to be able to remove and replace the electronics easily. So I did up some clips on sketchup and here is what I came up with. It clicks in solidly and there seems to be no tendency to slide side to side even though I didn't use any clips on the sides.
