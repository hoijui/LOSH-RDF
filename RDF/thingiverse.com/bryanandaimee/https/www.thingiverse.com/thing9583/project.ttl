    okh:function """A replacement tip for your beyblade collection. The kids were fighting and crying and wailing and gnashing their teeth today when I got home from work. It seems that the 5 year old had lost the 7 year old's beyblade tips. Out of 5 beyblades, only one was tipped. That's 80% tiplessness with a high misery index. Hopefully when they wake up, the peace of the family abode can be restored by this $0.10 print. But if not, well, I'll be heading off to work. :)\r
\r
I can't believe this thing worked the first time. It has all the retaining ledges and little clippy ridges and stuff. It fit the beyblade without much cleanup at all. \r
\r
OK, I guess I should have searched thingiverse first, here is a similar project. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8327 . I'll have to try his designs too and see if they work on the kids beyblades. \r

My blog if you are interested.""" ;
