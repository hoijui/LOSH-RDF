function: "A replacement tip for your beyblade collection. The kids were fighting and crying and wailing and gnashing their teeth today when I got home from work. It seems that the 5 year old had lost the 7 year old's beyblade tips. Out of 5 beyblades, only one was tipped. That's 80% tiplessness with a high misery index. Hopefully when they wake up, the peace of the family abode can be restored by this $0.10 print. But if not, well, I'll be heading off to work. :)\r\n\r\nI can't believe this thing worked the first time. It has all the retaining ledges and little clippy ridges and stuff. It fit the beyblade without much cleanup at all. \r\n\r\nOK, I guess I should have searched thingiverse first, here is a similar project. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8327 . I'll have to try his designs too and see if they work on the kids beyblades. \r\n\r\nMy blog if you are interested."
