\r
If you're willing to commit to saving up for a rainy day, print it as a single object, and when it's full you can smash it open. If you'd prefer to keep it  re-openable, there are holes in the back and front that are designed to be threaded with zip ties for a semi-permanent seal.\r
\r
The OpenSCAD file attached is parametric - you can adjust the dimensions and the wall thickness by using the parameters on top.\r
\r
There's a lot of room to add more surface detail to this model if someone wants to jump in with some derivatives. Also, I'd love to design a version that has snap-together hinges, or better yet, the dovetail-groove style connection like in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11977 for a nice, snug closure.""" ;
