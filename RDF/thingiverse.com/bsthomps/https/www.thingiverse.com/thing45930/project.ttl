    okh:function """Yet another spool holder for the Prusa, but this one has all the benefits/improvements I could think of.  \r
\r
-Bent support design allows filament to line up directly above extruder and not rub on anything  \r
\r
-My spools were damaged in shipping and the two sides were no longer attached. This inner and outer support holds the two halves together and allows for smooth rotation on the rod  \r
\r
-Spiral slots so that the holder can simply be lifted on and off of the machine without needing to take apart your Prusa in any way. Extremely rigid to the frame when the spool is cantilevered on the end, but the spiral slots allow for easy removal without binding  \r
\r
-Only vitamin is a leftover piece of threaded rod (and a 3mm Set Screw for added security locking in the threaded rod)  \r
\r
-Weight/Filament savings optimized for strength  \r
\r
-Spool inserts pivot smoothly on threaded rod with no bearings. If you look close you can see the inner pivot is extended up into the spool supports  \r
\r
-Spool insert halves securely snap together. No bolt/hardware needed  \r
\r
-Width is only constrained by length of threaded rod so you can have 1-3 spools on here  \r
\r
-ENJOY!   \r
