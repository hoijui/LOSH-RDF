*** This IS a Box *** You can hide things in this!  

I found this some time ago as a post. I went searching recently and found it also as an Instructable. But, it is not easily accessible here via Thingiverse. I'd ask for the others to post the cube here but, I guess their stuff is too old to be monitored. So --- from: http://www.instructables.com/community/Rapidprototyped-Weighted-delCompaniondel-Stor/  --- Here is a Companion/Storage Cube.  

Note: This is a BOX! I printed one very small Cube on my Thing-O-Matic (yellow) and a full 2" one on a V-Flash. Both are good to have!""" ;
