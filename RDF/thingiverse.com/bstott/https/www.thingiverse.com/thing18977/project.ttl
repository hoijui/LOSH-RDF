\r
 I uploaded the rocket body as a single two piece print and then separately if you wanted to print in different colors. \r
\r
Some changes could be done:\r
1. Make the combined body slots deeper so the rocket will not rock when assembled.\r
2. The ribs could be made longer to better fit the rocket.\r
\r
  But, it does work and is cute.""" ;
