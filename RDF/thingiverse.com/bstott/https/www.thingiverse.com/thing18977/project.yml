function: "This is a less than 4\" high rocket.   I saw the cardboard one and thought I want to print that! \r\n\r\n I uploaded the rocket body as a single two piece print and then separately if you wanted to print in different colors. \r\n\r\nSome changes could be done:\r\n1. Make the combined body slots deeper so the rocket will not rock when assembled.\r\n2. The ribs could be made longer to better fit the rocket.\r\n\r\n  But, it does work and is cute."
