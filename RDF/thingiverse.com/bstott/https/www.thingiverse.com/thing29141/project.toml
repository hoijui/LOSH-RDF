function = "This is a derivative of jamesarm97's Bowden clamp for his Rostock. In making a Rostock this hot end is a different style with threaded top. It doesn't need mounting bolt tangs. This was rescaled for this particular Hot End. Thanks for the original jamesarm97.\r\n\r\nNote: There is also another derivative on Thingiverse of a bowden tube mount for this type of use."
