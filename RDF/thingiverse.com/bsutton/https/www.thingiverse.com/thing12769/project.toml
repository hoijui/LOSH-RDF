function = "The cable guide is designed to provide a 'clipping' point for the power and thermister cables that are attached to the hotbed.\r\n\r\nWithout the clip during bed movement the cable tends to bend at the solder points which over time will weaken and break.\r\n\r\nThe cable guide isolates the solder points from any movement."
