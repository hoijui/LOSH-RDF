function: "My spice rack couldn't hold all of my spices, so I decided to make my own.\r\n\r\nThis file will generate a cut pattern for a laser cutter which will assemble into a spice rack. It was designed with 1/4\" material in mind but it will adjust itself reasonably well if you use something else.\r\n\r\n\r\neps file parameters [at top of file]\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nmaterial_thickness: how thick your input material is [matters for connections]\r\nnum_sides: the number of side pieces to render\r\nnum_beams: the number of beams to render\r\nnum_bottles_per_shelf: the number of bottles to fit on each shelf\r\nnum_shelves_high: the number of rows the spice rack will have\r\n\r\nbottle_height: the height of your largest bottle plus a healthy margin\r\nbottle_width: the width of your largest bottle as it faces you plus a margin\r\nbottle_depth: the depth of your largest bottle plus a healthy margin\r\n\r\nrack_beam_width: how wide each beam should be\r\nlaser_beam_width: for fine adjustment in the cut holes [affects tightness]"
