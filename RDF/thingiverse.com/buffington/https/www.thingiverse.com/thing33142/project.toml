function = "This is the right wing of a rubber band powered, peanut scale model airplane designed by Walt Mooney called Mordecai Murphy's Dart.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to recreate the model in way that allows for most, if not all, of the parts to be 3D printed and flyable using current micro RC electronics. \r\n\r\nWhere possible, parts have been designed to negate the need for rafts or support material."
