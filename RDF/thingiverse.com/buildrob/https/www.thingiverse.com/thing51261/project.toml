function = "This is a fully parametric design of a power supply terminal cover to fit the 12V DC power supplies commonly used on many RepRap printers today. \r\n\r\nThe different thing about this design is that it is secured by screwing down the cover into one of the low voltage terminals (V-) of the supply with a M4x16mm screw. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of using this screw down approach to secure the cover is that the cover clearances can then be far larger than if using a friction or press fit. \r\n\r\nSince there are many different makers of power supplies of this type and all are slightly different - then hopefully this screwdown version should be more likely to fit your supply without modification (if not then you can always modify the parametric openscad source file yourself)."
