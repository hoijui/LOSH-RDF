These are based on Rev E and are modified to use 1/4\" (5.5mm) acrylic instead of wood, which includes minor tweaks to T-slot widths, stress relief in the T-slots, widening of certain components like the fan cover parts, and removal of the bridge on the power supply cutout, all to make it as crack/break resistant as possible."
