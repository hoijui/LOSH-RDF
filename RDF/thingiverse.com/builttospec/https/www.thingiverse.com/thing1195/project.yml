function: "Just in time for the holidays, here's a spider to print on your MakerBot!  Print out a few for decorations or print out one and a ring in your size and glue together for some totally stereotypical Halloween jewelry!  \nThis is my first designed+printed object (woot!), and I really wanted to make this truly 3D but I don't think I'll have the time between now and the 31st to do so.  I think I'll try to make a version that prints out spider and ring in one go in the future as well."
