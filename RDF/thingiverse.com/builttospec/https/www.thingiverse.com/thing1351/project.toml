function = "This design is a derivative of the Paxtruder-0.2:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1125 \r\n\r\nMy idler wheel cracked about 2 weeks ago so I though it would be a good time to experiment with the Paxtruder design a bit.  I planned on making it a weekend project because I had plenty of acrylic around and I had some 1/2\\\" thick acetal scrap to make a pusher but, unfortunately, I had to put in an order to McMaster to finish this guy so it didn\\'t get completed till now.\r\n\r\nI wanted a drop in replacement for my extruder hardware for testing that could utilize as much of my current MakerBot components as possible, and this design seems to fit the bill.  You can use your existing dino mounts (both MK3 and MK4 designs should work) and extruter head hardware to mount this extruder and you can attach the extuder controller as you did with the idler wheel based design."
