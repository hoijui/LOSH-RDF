function = "A few people in our Makerbot users group wanted a set of covers for their bots a while back, so I designed a set of laser cut PETG panels that covered the holes on the original Cupcake.  I recently revisited the design after someone else wanted a ToM set so I decided to post the designs.\r\n\r\nI solved the problem of closing up the front of the bot by creating a fold down door that secured with a couple magnets and utilized some drawer pulls I had on hand.  Once the door and panels were installed on my bot, the entire thing looked kinda like an oven, hence the name.  Appropriate for a Cupcake, right?\r\n\r\nRather than just preventing drafts from affecting your builds, these panels can also be used in conjunction with a specialized fume hood I designed (which will be posted soon along with ToM oven files) to manage the ABS fumes produced by a bot.\r\n\r\nMore pics here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/builttospec/6103855648/in/photostream"
