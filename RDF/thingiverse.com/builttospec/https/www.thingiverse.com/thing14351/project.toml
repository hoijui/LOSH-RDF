function = "If you need two drive two steppers on a single axis (useful for some of the newer RepRap derivatives and some other CNC setups), this board allows you to drive two stepper controllers from a single output.  You can use it with controllers that use the standard MakerBot style 6 or 10 pin connectors, making it compatible with older RepRap drivers and all newer stepper controllers that are compatible with MakerBot hardware.\r\n\r\nThese were made for a modular CNC setup that I'm currently developing.  I've got a few spares if anybody's interested in grabbing a splitter or two."
