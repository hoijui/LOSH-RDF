You can use it with controllers that use the standard MakerBot style 6 or 10 pin connectors, making it compatible with older RepRap drivers and all newer stepper controllers that are compatible with MakerBot hardware.\r
\r
These were made for a modular CNC setup that I'm currently developing.  I've got a few spares if anybody's interested in grabbing a splitter or two.""" ;
