    okh:function """These are two designs for Arduino carrier boards that you can mount an Arduino, breadboard, and battery holder(s) of your choice to.  These are great if you want to run your Arduino project without being tethered to a wall or a PC and are great for Arduino classes, as you don't have to have a PC or wall wart for each participant.\r
\r
The smaller version has space for a 400 point breadboard and your choice of either a 9-volt or AA/AAA battery pack.  The larger version with space for a 830 point with both a 9-volt and AA/AAA battery pack (great for applications where you want to run servos or other devices off a separate power supply from you Arduino).""" ;
