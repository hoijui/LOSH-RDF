function = "I got a request to build a custom enclosure for the DockStar media hub (an impressive little embeded Linux box), so I thought I'd post up the files in case anyone else wants to make one.  I got to try out a couple things on this case design, including adding a simple light pipe for reading the status of the machine and an altertative side plate with break away ports so you can add a serial port to the side of your case or access the on board debug header."
