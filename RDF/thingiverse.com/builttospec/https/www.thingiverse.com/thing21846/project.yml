function: "I was planning on going to a networking session here in KC last week, but then I realized I've got some pretty lousy business cards. I figured I would try and make an awesome functional business card in time for the event that would make a good first impression. I came up with this 3.5\"x2\" card that snaps apart and forms a very functional rubber band gun!\r\n\r\nVideo of the card in action here:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/InnUcXhVeN0"
