function: "This laser cut Raspberry Pi enclosure design features light pipes for the status LEDs and obscures the T-slots for a nice clean looking enclosure.  \n\nAll off board connectors are accessable with the top off and you can use standard ribbon cable connectors through the case to hook up the expansion header as well. Spacing of the top layers have been adjusted so these should be compatible with pi plates when they become availiable with minimal additional hardware.  \n\nUPDATE:  \nThe design has been updated to support both the models of the Raspberry Pi board (A & B) and include better standoffs. Updates thanks to Thingiverse user RoboLemur for the design updates.  \n\nBlack acrylic kits are available here:  \nhttp://nvy.gd/Lv1ESn  \n\nAnd a limited number of translucent purple acrylic kits are available here:  \nhttp://nvy.gd/Lv2Ox9"
