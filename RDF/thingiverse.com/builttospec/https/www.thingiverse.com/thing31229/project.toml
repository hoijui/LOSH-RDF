function = "This is the Neuron, a learn to solder kit I threw together for the 2012 Kansas City Maker Faire. On the surface it's just another easy to assemble \"my first soldering project\" blinker, but put a few of them together and you can make a light and touch reactive light show! It functions as your typical alernating LED blinker with a jumper in place, but remove the jumper and they mirror pulses of light detected on one LED to the other. Chain a large set of them together and they'll activated each other in sequence. They're also bi-directional so you can send a pulse one direction in a chain and send another back the opposite direction. A single Neuron firing can activate more than one Neuron, forming branching light shows as well! You can even use one in blink mode to act as a convenient light pulse source."
