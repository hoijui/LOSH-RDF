    okh:function """This is a derivative of my previous Raspberry Pi enclosure that ditches the light pipes and bolt together design for an easier to assemble case with strong durable Delrin  clips to hold everything together. It's got fewer parts than the previous case and it's been designed for compatibility with Adafruit's Pi Plate prototyping board.  

Many of the mods to this new version where contributed by Thingiverse user RoboLemur.  

UPDATE:  
This design has been updated to support both models of the Raspberry Pi board (A and B), with custom sides for each and a better standoff design.""" ;
