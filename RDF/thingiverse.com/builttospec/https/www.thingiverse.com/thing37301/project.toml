function = "This is a sled mount and clip design for the original BeagleBoard. Simply clip your BeagleBoard into place and add a 400-point breadboard then start experimenting. Works with really old versions as well as the new ones (note that it's not compatible with the BeagleBoad-xM, that's another beast entirely)."
