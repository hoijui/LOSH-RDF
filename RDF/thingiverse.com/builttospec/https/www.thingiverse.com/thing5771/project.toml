function = "I cut some mounting plates to use with the self adhesive LED strips that you can get relatively inexpensively online.  They allow me to install and remove the lights easily on my Cupcake and prevent me from inadvertently ripping the strips off when the power cables get tugged on.  The mounting bracket that is installed on the Z-axis also works on the Thing-o-Matic."
