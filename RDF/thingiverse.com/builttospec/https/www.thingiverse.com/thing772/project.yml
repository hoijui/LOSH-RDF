function: Check out http://www.labywiinth.org/ for more details on the Labwiinth project. This is a bracket I manufactured for a Local KC science store to sell with their Labywiinth kits (If you\'re in the KC area, Vince will be doing a workshop July 11th http://hms-beagle.com/Programs.html). The original brackets were designed by Vince and hand cut out of Lexan, but Lexan doesn\'t agree with my laser cutter so these are made of 0.06\" PETG, the same plastic those indestructible blister packs are made out of!
