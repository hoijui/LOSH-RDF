function: "This is one of the first things I experimented with after getting my laser cutter.  I wanted to see what could be done with the cutter besides marking and vector cutting, so I decided to experiment with etching channels in acrylic.  This is a simple, mechanical \\\"inverter\\\" is the by-product of this and a recent discussion I had with a coworker about physical representations of logic gates.\r\n\r\nOn the \\\"input\\\" side, the plunger being pushed in represents a 1 on the input, and pulled out represents a zero.  On the output, a pulled in plunger represents a 0, and pushed out a 1.  This convention is used because the output is presumably being used as the input of the next gate in the chain."
