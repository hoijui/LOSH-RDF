function = "This is a free standing Wiimote holder that can be used with a tripod.  I've used this a few times to set up Johnny Chung Lee's Wiimote whiteboard with a projector to do a number of fun things. It's a little tall, but I wanted to be able to use the Wiimote in setups were what it was tracking happened to be on the ceiling or floor without having to use a tripod.\r\n\r\nJohnny Chung Lee's Wiimote projects:\r\nhttp://johnnylee.net/projects/wii/\r\n\r\nJust a quick note when using with a tripod - some tripod fasteners are not long enough to go through the acrylic and fasten securely with a 1/4\" nut, unfortunately.  My tripod just barely works with this setup."
