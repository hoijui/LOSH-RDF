function = "This has been a relatively useful project for me.  This wire rack holds two rows of up to 7\" wire spools or 12\" spools if you decide to cut out an additional base piece.  It's primarily constructed from 1/4\" ABS sheet with 1/2\" electrical conduit to hold the spools.  ABS sheet generally comes with one textured side (which you might be able to see in the photos) and one flat side, and it's pretty resilient stuff.  You should also be able to stack these racks and bolt them together, but I haven't built a second one yet to see how well this works."
