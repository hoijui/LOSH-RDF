function = "This is the final version of the I-Hacked.com badge (art by surbo).  This badge is modified slightly from the original design to house a bicolor LED (hevnsnt's awesome idea, not mine!) and to allow the battery tray to stay in place without any additional hardware (so it can be attached to other badges,  etc.).\r\n\r\nThe battery tray also features a nice lip so the CR2025 wonâ€™t just fall out when you pull out the tray.  This was done primarily to convince badge recipients that the battery only went in one way, as the bicolor LED was to remain an \"undocumented feature\".  All badges had red/blue LEDs and started off red, but if you flipped the entire tray over and re-inserted it youâ€™d have a blue badge.  As many of you probably know, blues and reds donâ€™t generally get along very wellâ€¦"
