function = "I don't have a whole lot of experience with the Arduino, but I find that I often use it as a platform to quickly prototype circuits and test out components.  Since I've only got one, this generally means that I have to pull it from whatever project it happens to be currently connected up to use it for prototyping/debugging something else and hook it back up again later.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I created this simple wiring harness so I can easily move my Arduino from one project to the next and back again with little hassle.  You can freely insert jumper wires and devices with 0.1\" headers with the shield on for prototyping.  Then when you have the Arduino wired up how you like it, just clamp the jumper wires down to make it a little more permanent.\r\n\r\nI also sometimes wire up miscellaneous connectors for prototyping, like the 15-pin PC joystick connector pictured, and I can connect those directly to the Arduino and not have to worry as much about accidentally pulling wires out as I'm connecting devices and moving them around with the shield installed.  There's also plenty of space to access the reset button and the ISP header on my Duemilanove board should I need them."
