function: "I wanted to make a cable rack even before krekr posted his design, but I wanted to make it clamp on to my workbench rather than be permanently attached.  This derivative takes his design and adds clamps so I don\\'t have to drill holes into whatever old computer desk I happen to be using as workbench at the time!\r\n\r\nI've wanted to make something that incorporates a custom clamp and I also have been wanting to try to make some snap together parts for a while, so I incorporated both into this design.  If you want to use something other than ABS to make these clamps though, it would be pretty easy to replace these snaps with T-slots for fasteners (which I might do anyway)."
