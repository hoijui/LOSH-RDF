function = "This is a cap designed to fit over the XT60 connector.  I usually keep all my Lipo batteries together in a box and it has always been in the back of my head that one fateful day two batteries will short themselves together.  Hence, a simple cap.\r\n\r\nI've also attached a pattern of 2 and pattern of 6 for those who want to print multiple parts."
