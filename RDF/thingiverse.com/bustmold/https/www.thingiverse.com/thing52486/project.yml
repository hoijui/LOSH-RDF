function: "I have an old vintage Soviet robot toy. It's dated from the 80's and has \"Made in USSR\" stamp on it.   \nMr. Roboto had it's \"ear plugs\" missing and I saw a great opportunity to use 3D printer to fix it. He is really happy now!  \nDesign by Mold Busters https://www.bustmold.com/locations/ottawal/"
