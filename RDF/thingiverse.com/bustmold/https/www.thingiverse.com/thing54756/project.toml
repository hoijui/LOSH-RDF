function = "\"Removing 20 lionfish on a single dive equates to saving approximately 300,000 juvenile fish over a one-year period,\"said Dr Dayne Buddo of the University of the West Indies' Discovery Bay Marine Lab (UWI-DBML).  \nLionfish are the first exotic species to invade coral reefs. They have multiplied at a rate that is almost unheard of in marine history, going from nonexistent to pervasive in just a few short years. Along the way, they've eaten or starved out local fish, disrupted commercial fishing, and threatened the tourism industry. Some experts believe that lionfish are so widespread that their effect on the ecosystems of the Western Atlantic will be almost impossible to reverse. Still, some people are determined to try, if only to protect those waters which haven't yet been invaded.  \nDownload the world's first 3D-printable fully customizable dive spear for lionfish hunting designed by Mold Busters to protect the reefs and the environment.  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I7ceGg3kCU  \n\nCheck out version1 - fully cutomizable dive spear - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:49778  \n\nFor more information about our environmental efforts, please visit https://www.bustmold.com/locations/ottawa/  or https://www.bustmold.com/locations/montreal/"
