function: "Every so often the screw flange on the top of the Z-Stage would loosen the bolts and cause problems. This would result in a varience in the z offset this resulting in bad prints. And those nuts are really small and hard to tighten. So I wanted a better solution than every so often tightening those nuts. \r\n\r\nThis cap will fit over the flange and allow you to attach it with a few M3 bolts. You will have to drill some holes on the top of the z stage."
