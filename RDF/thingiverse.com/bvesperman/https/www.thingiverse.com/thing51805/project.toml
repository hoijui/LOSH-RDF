function = "Sometime ago I started working on prototyping on the Arduino platform and got a good working device. The problem was I couldn't get out of the 'ball of wires on my desk' phase. I wanted to have a generally well contained device that I could just hand off to someone and not run into the problem of a wire falling out and the end user having to debug the device. I also wanted the ability to take it apart and attach new sensors or rearrange the contents without too much headache."
