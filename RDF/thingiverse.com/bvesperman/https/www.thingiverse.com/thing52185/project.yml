function: "This is a parametric 3D printer I designed in OpenSCAD and made with parts from my Thing-O-Matic. The OpenSCAD scripts allow me to make a printer of almost any size as long as I can get rods, a platform to go with it, and can cut the enclosure on a laser cutter.  \n\nI accomplished three goals with this project.  \n\n1. I was very happy with my Thing-O-Matic, but as the replicator and it's variants came out I saw the parts availability of my machine started to dry up. I need to take more ownership of sourcing parts.  \n\n2. I could download almost anything off thingiverse and print it on my Thing-O-Matic, except larger things. I had size envy.  \n\n3. I was good at designing simple one or two part designs but I wanted to design a very complicated device with several interconnected parts.   \n\nDesigned and Built at [Sector 67 Madison, WI](http://www.sector67.org)"
