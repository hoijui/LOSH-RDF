function = "This is for a aprox. 4ft by 3ft printer based on the Ultimaker. It has not been made yet and it a thing in progress. It is set up for 4 extruders and also the files have a 2nd normal sized Ultimaker added because there was extra room. (added bonus!!) \r\nYou can follow our progress on my sons Blog www.rep-up.com you can blame him this was his idea. I hope this will make a nice piece of furniture and I need to figure out a way for my wife to allow it to.. \r\n\r\nAlso any comments, ideas, hate mail, love notes, we would love we are not planing on cutting this for a few weeks.. (hate mail goes to my son..)"
