function = "DrewPetitclerc's take on WindhamGraves' War of The Worlds Playset was great but needed to be made into plates for easy printing. Yes, it was easier for me to turn this into plates than it was to just print the parts. Oh well. I've also reduced them to 75% of the original to easily fit on a Cupcake.\r\n\r\nThe STL files are ready to print while the ZIP file contains the reduced versions of the individual parts as well as the openSCAD files to make the plates. The war machine plate will print one war machine while the tanks plate will print four tanks."
