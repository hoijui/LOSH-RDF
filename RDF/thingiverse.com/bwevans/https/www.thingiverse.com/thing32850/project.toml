function = "A slightly smaller, sleeker, more portable and more desktop friendly version of Johann's Rostock Delta 3D Printer. Key improvements have been made to the parametric nature of the design files with a laser cut frame generated by the SCAD file to accomodate the desired print bed dimensions. Also there's a new extruder design to go along with that will be published soon.\r\n\r\nFor more details, build notes, and other information visit the RepRap wiki at: http://reprap.org/wiki/Rostock_mini\r\n\r\nMore to come in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nUpdate 11.11.12: It's printing but there are still some problems with the bowden extruder I designed because of weak-sauce push-fit pneumatic fittings. Am redesigning to use a better tube setup. Once verified in the next couple of weeks I'll be posting more details and the extruder as a separate design.\r\n\r\nUpdate 12.09.12: New Bowden design is complete but hasn't been working as well as it should. Still needs more testing.\r\n\r\nUpdate 12.16.12: Updated v2 files for hotend_v2.stl and the still experimental extruder.stl with OpenSCAD source files in source_v2.zip. These changes get rid of the unreliable pneumatic push-fit fittings and replace with 4mm OD PTFE tubing, McMaster p/n 52335K32, and M4 nuts threaded on each end (one in the hotend and another in the extruder)."
