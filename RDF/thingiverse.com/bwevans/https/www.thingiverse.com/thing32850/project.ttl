    okh:function """A slightly smaller, sleeker, more portable and more desktop friendly version of Johann's Rostock Delta 3D Printer. Key improvements have been made to the parametric nature of the design files with a laser cut frame generated by the SCAD file to accomodate the desired print bed dimensions. Also there's a new extruder design to go along with that will be published soon.\r

More to come in the next few weeks.\r
\r
Update 11.11.12: It's printing but there are still some problems with the bowden extruder I designed because of weak-sauce push-fit pneumatic fittings. Am redesigning to use a better tube setup. Once verified in the next couple of weeks I'll be posting more details and the extruder as a separate design.\r
\r
Update 12.09.12: New Bowden design is complete but hasn't been working as well as it should. Still needs more testing.\r
\r
Update 12.16.12: Updated v2 files for hotend_v2.stl and the still experimental extruder.stl with OpenSCAD source files in source_v2.zip. These changes get rid of the unreliable pneumatic push-fit fittings and replace with 4mm OD PTFE tubing, McMaster p/n 52335K32, and M4 nuts threaded on each end (one in the hotend and another in the extruder).""" ;
