(Ok - I am doing this here because I can not find a way to just comment on a thing - am I just being dense?)\r
WOW!!! My very first thing and it is featured!!!!   Thanks for all the likes and downloads.   Please send pictures of what you print.\r
\r

\r
Be on the look out for a pool cue holder in the next couple of days.  I have a couple of things I need to tweak on the CAD and do some test prints.""" ;
