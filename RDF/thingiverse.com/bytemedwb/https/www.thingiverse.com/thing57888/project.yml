function: "Designed this for our  company pool league teams.   You can never find a bridge at the bar when you need one and when you do they are crappy.   This is designed to go on the end of any standard cue.\r\n\r\n(Ok - I am doing this here because I can not find a way to just comment on a thing - am I just being dense?)\r\nWOW!!! My very first thing and it is featured!!!!   Thanks for all the likes and downloads.   Please send pictures of what you print.\r\n\r\nAs someone said this begs to be customizable.     Does anyone have a process to go from Inventor to Open SCAD?\r\n\r\nBe on the look out for a pool cue holder in the next couple of days.  I have a couple of things I need to tweak on the CAD and do some test prints."
