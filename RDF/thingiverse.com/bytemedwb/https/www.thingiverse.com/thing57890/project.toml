function = "Small 7/16ths (11mm) wrench designed to fit on your key chain.    Chose this size because my robotics team never seemed to have enough of these.  The team plans to print a bunch of these and bring them to competitions to hand out..  \n\nUpdate - 19Dec2014:  I added a version of the STL file with no text and a short Openscad script to add the text.  It depends on the Write.scad library."
