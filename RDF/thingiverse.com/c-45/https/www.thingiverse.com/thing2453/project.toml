function = "A lot of the time in movies you'll see space ships like X-wings flying around  like planes, but in space there's no atmosphere, no lift or drag, nothing to slow them down so unless they've got thrusts placed all over the ship to provide lateral thrust they couldn't possibly fly like this (and if they did it would be really inefficient and wasteful). It would be much more likely that in a space battle you'd have small cubes or spheres with thrusters all over and rotating guns allowing them to move quickly in any direction. \r\n\r\nI made two small models one fighter (tiny one) and one heavy bomber (large one with big rotating gun)."
