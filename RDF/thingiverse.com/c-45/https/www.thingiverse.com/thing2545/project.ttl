If you\\'ve ever been on the bus holding onto to the railing and trying to read with one hand, been in the tub with one hand wet and a paperback book in the other (vik\\'s Example), or simply wanted to read a book one handed this is for you. Now with this page opener you can keep the book open with one hand.  \r
