function: "This is a laser cut version of vik\\'s 3d printed Page Opener. \r\n\r\nIf you\\'ve ever been on the bus holding onto to the railing and trying to read with one hand, been in the tub with one hand wet and a paperback book in the other (vik\\'s Example), or simply wanted to read a book one handed this is for you. Now with this page opener you can keep the book open with one hand.  \r\n\r\nonce again the idea for this originally came from vik\\'s 3d printed Page Opener here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1120"
