    okh:function """This is a little Rubber-Band powered quarter dispenser I made to be put into a cup holder of a car to hold quarters. There are catches in the container and on the 2 plungers for the rubber band. I would like to print this eventually, but as of now I do not know if it works well, or if it prints very well.\r
Thanks, and any suggestions are appreciated, as this is the first thing I have made.  If you think you can make it work well, feel free to try to make it, just comment at least so I can learn what I screwed up.\r
\r
Original file made in Tinkercad here: https://tinkercad.com/things/82BcN5TzLTq\r
\r
04/28/12-I have now added a version that has been "fixed" in netfabb cloud, so the stl file should print better.\r
\r
04/29/12- I have made a V2 file that allows the plungers to be inserted through the bottom, then a piece to slide in to cover the bottom.  FOR V2 YOU MUST PRINT THE V2 FILE AND THE PLUNGERS (Error in TinkerCAD)\r
\r
TO DO:\r
-Print :-P\r
-Fix lip, make sure can print\r
-Make TinkerCAD work with plungers in V2""" ;
