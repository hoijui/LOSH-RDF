function: "This is a little Rubber-Band powered quarter dispenser I made to be put into a cup holder of a car to hold quarters. There are catches in the container and on the 2 plungers for the rubber band. I would like to print this eventually, but as of now I do not know if it works well, or if it prints very well.\r\nThanks, and any suggestions are appreciated, as this is the first thing I have made.  If you think you can make it work well, feel free to try to make it, just comment at least so I can learn what I screwed up.\r\n\r\nOriginal file made in Tinkercad here: https://tinkercad.com/things/82BcN5TzLTq\r\n\r\n04/28/12-I have now added a version that has been \"fixed\" in netfabb cloud, so the stl file should print better.\r\n\r\n04/29/12- I have made a V2 file that allows the plungers to be inserted through the bottom, then a piece to slide in to cover the bottom.  FOR V2 YOU MUST PRINT THE V2 FILE AND THE PLUNGERS (Error in TinkerCAD)\r\n\r\nTO DO:\r\n-Print :-P\r\n-Fix lip, make sure can print\r\n-Make TinkerCAD work with plungers in V2"
