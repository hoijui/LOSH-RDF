function: "This is a mount I made that allows a phone to be hung from a Replicator to be used as a real-time webcam (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en), or for recording video/time-lapse of a print.  This mount should accommodate phones of any size, and has been tested with a Moto Droid, iPhone, and even a Note II.  This mount is also adjustable by sliding on the rim of the Replicator, and the  Phone mount itself can separately go up and down with hooks built into the Replicator mount, and matching \"sockets\" in the phone mount, letting you get the perfect camera height for your print.  To hold the phone into the phone mount, there are several holes at different distances from the wall, so that filament may be inserted into the holes depending on the model and location of the camera.\r\n\r\nOriginal file was made in Tinkercad."
