I would have posted a better picture, but my printer has been acting up recently, so I only got one full print out.  Either way, all the parts printed perfectly when the printer itself wasn't broken.  These glasses have 100% working hinges using the amazing Pin Connectors library, and are made with a little give so they can even fold up!  The lenses can be made rectangular/square, and round (circle/oval).  The lenses can also be filled with a pattern, based off the idea and module from the Makerbot iPhone Case.  

Basically all the lengths and settings are completely customizable, so they can be made to fit basically anyone.""" ;
