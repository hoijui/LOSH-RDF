function: This file was generated using Mastercam X4.  I had intended to make it without support but I think it will require it in order to be fully round.  The bearing does function and only requires a bit of cutting with a blade once the raft is removed.  I made this as a test to see if my machine is truly printing round objects.  Sadly, there is still some work to be done before it prints completely round!
