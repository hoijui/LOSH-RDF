    okh:function """This is a logo of one of my buddies companies that I think is pretty cool.  I've also engraved this logo onto some business card holders with a CNC machine I have.  It was my first real tracing type design in blender.  I was having issues with the blender stl model getting the plate to be seen by Slic3r.  I'll describe best I can and maybe someone can shed some light on why I was having issues.  I created the DICE logo with bezier curves in blender and then just extruded, which seemed simple enough.  At that point I had an extrusion of just the logo and that model exported fine.  I wanted the logo to be on a plate so I can use it for a keychain so in blender, I just used a cube and transformed it to the right dimensions to create a plate for the logo, then positioned it so it was intersecting the logo.  From that I just exported an stl model.  I looked at it in meshlab and it looked perfect with the plate, but then when I bring that same stl file into Slic3r the plate was missing.  Not sure exactly what versions I'm using, but I can look into that.  I'm pretty new at this so maybe it's just a Slic3r issue.  I didn't try any other slicing tool.  \r
\r
To get this to work I had to pull in the model into repetier host (I'm using a Solidoodle 2 with repetier host) and pull in another cube.  Then I transformed the cube again just like I did in blender to make a thin plate and put that underneath the DICE logo.  I then exported that STL model, which is the one I uploaded and that printed just fine with the plate.  I didn't know you could combine models like that through repetier host, it can be pretty useful for quick fixes.  I would also love to be able to punch holes in stl models using repetier host, but I haven't figured that out yet.""" ;
