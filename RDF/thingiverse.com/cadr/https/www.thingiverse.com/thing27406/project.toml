function = "My first model.  It is based on one of my kid's train tracks.  I've tried to parameterize it.\r\n\r\nThe train_track module takes a parameter to determine the length of the track.  There are also variables for other aspect of the track.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is appreciated!  I think I may still need to work on the connectors, maybe give a little wiggle room to make them fit better.\r\n\r\nI made a bit of a post about this here: http://objectaday.blogspot.com/2012/07/first-object-train-tracks.html"
