function: "This is a smoothed version of the rabbit piece from my arimaa set ( See http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42032 ) I made as a test to see how subdivision surfaces would look and print. Eventually, I would like all of the pieces of that set to look like this.  \n\nNOTE: Print with supports! The front legs are too rounded to sit flat while printing otherwise!"
