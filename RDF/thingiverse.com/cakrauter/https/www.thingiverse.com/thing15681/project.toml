function = "This is a train car for wooden track train sets with pegs on top for connecting Lego-style bricks. This allows you to make your own custom train cars.\r\nIt is a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11671 by sconine, with steel axles and magnet couplers.\r\nFor the couplers, it uses acorn nuts on the ends with magnets behind them for coupling to other cars.\r\nThe wheels and body were made with OpenSCAD, so they can be modified as needed to fit different hardware or to get a good fit with the pegs. \r\nThere is also an assembly fixture which was made in Alibre Design, as I had trouble doing it with OpenSCAD. The fixture helps with gluing the wheels onto the axles and getting them straight. It is especially handy if you are going to use cyanoacrylate which sets quickly. \r\nNOTE: The STL files are nominal size. I had to scale the body up by 1.5% to account for shrinkage and get the pegs to align."
