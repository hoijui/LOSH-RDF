function = "What/Why:\r\nThe armrest on my lounge/sofa is wide, but does not hold items well. My clumsiness, aswell as my cat often knock things off. This is a small table which will allow teacups, my phone and whatnot to sit on the armrest without being knocked off.\r\n \r\nHow:\r\nEach STL file is 1 quarter of the item. Print 4 to make a full item. Some support material will be required for the slots which allow the peices to interlock.\r\n\r\nAs for the small separate piece on the side, glue them to the bottom of the table, so as to provide a snug fit to your armrest.\r\n\r\nPhotos will be uploaded soon, when I have more time on my hands"
