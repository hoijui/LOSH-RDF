function = "This is a part of Adrian's Geared extruder.\r\nOriginal part is a bit weak, I noticed after around 80 hours its worn out..\r\nSo i made this part a bit stronger/bigger (where possible) and the hole is not through now.\r\n\r\nThe length of the 4mm inlay-rod can also be longer: 38mm and it goes all the way untill under bolts now, so the reprap parts doesnt get all the forces, but the load quickly transmits to the bolts..\r\n\r\n(We are also: www.mendel-parts.com)"
