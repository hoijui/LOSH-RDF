function = "Well i wanted to have a very simple, but bearing based spool system.\r\n\r\nSo i came up with this.. its only one new STL file needed twice.\r\nAnd I used two old z-leadscrew-base_2off parts.\r\n\r\nSo here is complete list:\r\n2x z-leadscrew-base_2off STL\r\n2x spool_v2 STL \r\n\r\n6x m4x16 cap screws\r\n12x washers m4\r\n6x m4 nylock nuts\r\n\r\n3x 180mm stud m8\r\n1x 280mm stud m8\r\n4x 250mm studs m8  (depends how high you want your spoolsystem to be)\r\n\r\n28x m8 nuts\r\n24x m8 washers\r\n4x m8 large washers (regular might also work)\r\n\r\n2x bearing 608\r\n2x block of wood, doesnt really care what size etc.\r\n\r\nIts possible to adjust the diameter from 100mm to 180mm, so most spools should fit.\r\nAlso its partly shelled out to reduce print time, while not really reducing strength.\r\n\r\nOw and yes this cannot be printed on a makerbot.\r\nFirst I wanted to design something smart/smaller that could be assembled.\r\nBut i was in a hurry and thought.. well who has a makerbot anyway these days? Better put yours on ebay and build a Mendel ;).\r\n\r\nUpdate: there is now a v3, it has small marks so you can balance out the studs correctly.\r\nIf they are all equal positioned the force required to rotate is least.\r\nalso making the spool a bit higher (+ 10-20cm) then in the older pictures here, will reduce force on x-carriage in horizontal direction.\r\n\r\nUpdate2: I've made a revision of the z-leadscrew-base. Making the part a bit smaller/faster to print. (Because I didnt have any old z-leadscre-base parts left and wanted to make another spool system..)\r\nAnd I've extended the spool a bit (v4), because i noticed it was a bit on short side with new full rolls.\r\n\r\n(ps. in my opinion: innovation = simplicity / re-use)"
