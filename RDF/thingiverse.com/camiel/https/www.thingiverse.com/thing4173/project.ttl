    okh:function """I've been testing a bit with thin shelled frame vertexes lately.\r
But most small ribs added alof of time for printing.\r
So there was no print time reduction, only in mass a bit.\r
For this version2, i made a pretty good compromise between weight/printtime/strength (I think)\r
At least for PLA that is, i just printed one at 2500mm/min (the green one in pictures).\r
And im amazed about the strenght.. i think it was only a little bit quicker then normal, but i did use more dense settings.\r
\r
But the weight reduction is 40%... \r
And off course alot less warping :)\r
Btw, Im not finished yet, so v2 is not final.\r
\r
PS: There is a large and small (sm) STL, because i had trouble with repsnapper v333 and the large STL. With small i mean less triangles/facets, not smaller dimensions\r
But maybe in other programs the large STL works fine also.""" ;
