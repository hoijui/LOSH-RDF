function: "I've been testing a bit with thin shelled frame vertexes lately.\r\nBut most small ribs added alof of time for printing.\r\nSo there was no print time reduction, only in mass a bit.\r\nFor this version2, i made a pretty good compromise between weight/printtime/strength (I think)\r\nAt least for PLA that is, i just printed one at 2500mm/min (the green one in pictures).\r\nAnd im amazed about the strenght.. i think it was only a little bit quicker then normal, but i did use more dense settings.\r\n\r\nBut the weight reduction is 40%... \r\nAnd off course alot less warping :)\r\nBtw, Im not finished yet, so v2 is not final.\r\n\r\nPS: There is a large and small (sm) STL, because i had trouble with repsnapper v333 and the large STL. With small i mean less triangles/facets, not smaller dimensions\r\nBut maybe in other programs the large STL works fine also."
