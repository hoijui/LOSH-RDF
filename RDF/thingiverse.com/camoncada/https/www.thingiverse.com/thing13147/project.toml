function = "Urticine-O is an organizer of jewelry such as necklaces, bracelets and earrings. This display generates an amazing functional sculpture inspired by a coral named Urtinice-eques. This coral  takes part of the most beautiful family of corals named Ceriantharia or commonly known Tube Anemones. This kind of coral has as main characteristic wonderful tentacles, which show a stunning motion produced by cold and warm sea currents meanwhile the whole ecology is collecting and organizing food for another species under the sea. This concept is applied to Urticine-O; each tentacle was design to organize any piece of jewelry with a beautiful design making easier daily routine saving of time.\r\nUrticine-O works with one unit or more than one according to the number of jewelry pieces and user. This organizer could be use by any person, kids or adults, which is a versatile feature.\r\nUrticine-O is product of the examination of nature, its models, systems, processes, and elements to emulate or take inspiration from in order to solve human problems. I am convinced that the new generation of designers has a huge number of new tools in service of new creations. The 3d printer machine in conjunction with new 3d software gives the opportunity to produce new geometries, in my case, the possibility of understanding nature morphologies and then to develop new systems focused on new opportunities of design.\r\nThis project must be made in glow-in-the-dark"
