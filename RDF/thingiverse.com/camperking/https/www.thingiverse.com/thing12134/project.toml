function = "My Parametric Box is like this Thing. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3938\r\nBut I completely rewrote it in OpenSCAD. You can define the height, the diameter and the number of sections you want. This design needs no screw, I have used tbusers pin connector. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10541 So if you want to edit this you will need to download his pins.scad.\r\nThe box in the stl file has a diameter of 80mm and a height of 20mm and 6 sections.\r\nI have added an option to switch between pin or M3 screw connection.\r\n\r\nIf you like it, you can donate bitcoins to the address in my profile ;)"
