function: "Wanted to make a cooler looking side panel than just a flat piece of plexiglass... So I vacuum formed a panel I think makerbot would have made if they had made one. ;)\r\n\r\nWorking on a front cover and top lid hope to completed soon. \r\n\r\nFinally finished front cover and love it! Just have to decide on a clip or hinge or both to hold it in place. I was thinking a couple of magnets would be sweet... Just have to see what works best."
