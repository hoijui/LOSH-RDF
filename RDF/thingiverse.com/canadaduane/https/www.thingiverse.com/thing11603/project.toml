function = "Ever since my friend Mike B. showed me a herringbone gear that he had printed from rhys-jones'  Herringbone Geared Extruder blueprints, I've been interested in making my own. What would be really useful, I thought, would be a parametric version of this type of gear--then we could build custom gear sizes for robot parts, or whatever project we have going.  So here is my attempt at using OpenSCAD to generate parametric herringbone gears.\r\n\r\nIt's a work in progress, but I hope this might be useful in its current state and maybe as a community we can figure out the best way to generate these."
