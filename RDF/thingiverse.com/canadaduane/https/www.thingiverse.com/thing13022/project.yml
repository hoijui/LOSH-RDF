function: "My wife and I tried a couple of different kinds of safety clips for cupboards prior to having a 3D printer and we were shocked at how difficult to use and cumbersome the adjustable clips are.\r\n\r\nHere is a custom clip for our under-the-sink bathroom cupboard doors. One side is slightly tighter than the other so that it stays on one handle when pulled off."
