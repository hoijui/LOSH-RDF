function = "This is a first attempt at making a key rack. It's decent, but if I were to do it again, I'd make the holes smaller (rather than build spacers after-the-fact), and I'd make the back panel thinner. I was experimenting with OpenSCAD's Minkowski and Hull transformations, so that's my excuse for the design decisions :)"
