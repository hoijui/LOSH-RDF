function: "This is a handle / blade holder for matte style blades, turning them into less dangerous and mostly useful 3D printer build platform scrapers.\r\n\r\nI have a bunch of replacement blades for my razor (what I've called an X-Acto knife up until now :), and I had begun using one as a \"scraper\" for getting things off the build platform of my Ultimaker. Like Suavepotato mentioned in his description of \"Razor Blade Holder and Scraper\", \"I do not like using a naked blade.\" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3090)\r\n\r\nUpdate: I've added a \"guard\" perimeter around the blade as nostarman suggested, and made the base of the handle rounded and IMO more aesthetically pleasing."
