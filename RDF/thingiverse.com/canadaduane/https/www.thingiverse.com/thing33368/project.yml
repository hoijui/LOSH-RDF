function: "NOTE: Version 2.0 of the MakerSlider is called the Cinemaker Pocket Dolly and is on Thingiverse at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42521\r\n\r\nThis is an Arduino-controlled video camera slider that you can fit in your trunk and attach to a tripod. It uses makerslide rails for the linear motion. Aside from the aluminum, its parts can all be printed on a 3D printer (so far).\r\n\r\nSee http://makerslider.com/\r\n\r\nThe slider is still a work-in-progress, but as a manual camera slider can be used as-is. Some improvements in the near-term include stronger endcaps, and a tripod mount that will not slip. (Note: I've begun work on a motorized version of the slider. The subplate.stl file is a plate that mounts a NEMA 17 motor to the standard aluminum carriage).\r\n\r\nIn the future, the MakerSlider will use stepper motors for full hands-off automation.\r\n\r\nNote: much of the design ideas are taken from Bart Dring's original makerslide camera slider project at http://www.buildlog.net/wiki/doku.php?id=ms:ms_slider"
