function = "With Halloween right around the corner, I decided to create a \"safe\" LED candle to add to my decorations.  It's 80 mm high x 75 mm in diameter.  Printed in natural white ABS, it produces a realistic glow.\r\n\r\nI purchased some flickering LEDs from an on-line electronics retailer, but needed a way to mount them.  I made the LED holder to mount the LED with a CR2032 3v. coin battery.  Since the LED is rated at 3 volts, no resister is needed.  The holder grips the LED and battery and it's the perfect size for the 3D printed Votive Candle.  You can also use widely available commercial LED candles.\r\n\r\nThe LED and holder also works great to illuminate other 3D printed vases and objects, and the CR2032 coin battery lasts a very long time!"
