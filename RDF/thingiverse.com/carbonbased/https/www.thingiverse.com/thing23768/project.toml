function = "At my day job as a custom cable assembler, I use X-Acto knives and picks quite a lot but I don't like setting them down unprotected on my desk when switching between them since they are sharp and/or pointy. So this thing was made to hold them, as well as pens, brushes, and whatever other cylindrical things you might have around. The styling is a bit, um, interesting so feel free to modify."
