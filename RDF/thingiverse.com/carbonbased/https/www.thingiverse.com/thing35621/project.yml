function: I guess that I'm developing a fetish for holders, seeing as this is my third one to date. Anyway, this thing is used to hold the most commonly used Sherline mill & lathe tools. It started out as a simple place to keep the little chuck rods but quickly grew out of hand. Hopefully you all will find it useful too.
