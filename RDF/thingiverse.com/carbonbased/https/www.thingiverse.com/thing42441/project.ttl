    okh:function """I very sensibly tried to cut my fingertip off with a pair of tin snips the other day. I damn near did it too, with just about 20% left attached. Since I was also sensible enough not to seek medical attention nor get any stitches, I designed and printed this finger splint to prevent any further trauma while things are healing.\r
\r
It is sized for my middle finger, and I do have little girly-man hands, so you may have to scale things up or down to suit your needs. I actually hope that no one needs this thing, but I'll be glad if it does help someone who does.""" ;
