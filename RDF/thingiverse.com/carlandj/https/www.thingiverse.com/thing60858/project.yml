function: "The plate leveling card MakerBot provides doesn't last forever. I also feel like I don't always get my leveling right all the time. \r\nUse these tabs to check adhesion on your platform at all corners and the center areas too. The tabs are 0.4mm thick to test at 0.2mm and 0.1mm layer heights. The print is fast and uses very little plastic. Great for really dialing in your platform just before an important print. This file is specifically for the Rep2 platform.\r\n\r\nInspired by: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:60522\r\n\r\nI thought it would be useful to have tabs at all corners and the center. Sometime I print things at the edges and they fall off regardless of my calibration with the card."
