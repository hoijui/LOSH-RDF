function: Making this Name Card Holder is an easy way to hold your Name Card up on a desk.  Use the vector tool on acrylic in Illustrator.  Make the thickness of the line .001 after forming the triangular pieces.  Print with the instruction settings given.  I made this for my dad, as a stand for his Name Card I designed. I chose to make this stand because I thought it was an great way to present his Name Card I made him.
