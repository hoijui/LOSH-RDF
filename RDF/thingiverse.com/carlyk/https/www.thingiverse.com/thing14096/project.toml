function = "Taylor Swift says Speak Now!  The design of the plaque revolves around the quote by Taylor Swift said around the world on her Speak Now tour.  I made this for my sister because she is a big fan of Taylor and wanted to remember her memorable words.  I printed the design on black acrylic by using the CNC laser printer. I chose black acrylic in order for the letters and design to be more legible to read and stand out.  The design was created in Illustrator.  Hopefully my sister will like the plaque I made for her. \r\n\r\nQuote: Real life is a funny thing you know. I think most of us feel like weâ€™re reaching the end of our lives and looking back and regretting moments when we didnâ€™t speak up, when we didnâ€™t say â€œI love you!â€x9d When we shouldâ€™ve said â€œIâ€™m Sorry!â€x9d So thereâ€™s a time for silence, thereâ€™s a time to wait your turn.  But if you so clearly know how you feel and so clearly know what you need to say youâ€™ll know it.  I donâ€™t think you should wait, I think you should Speak Now.  â€“ Taylor Swift"
