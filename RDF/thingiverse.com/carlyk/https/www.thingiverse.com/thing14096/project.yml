function: "Taylor Swift says Speak Now!  The design of the plaque revolves around the quote by Taylor Swift said around the world on her Speak Now tour.  I made this for my sister because she is a big fan of Taylor and wanted to remember her memorable words.  I printed the design on black acrylic by using the CNC laser printer. I chose black acrylic in order for the letters and design to be more legible to read and stand out.  The design was created in Illustrator.  Hopefully my sister will like the plaque I made for her. \r\n\r\nQuote: Real life is a funny thing you know. I think most of us feel like we\xE2\u20AC\u2122re reaching the end of our lives and looking back and regretting moments when we didn\xE2\u20AC\u2122t speak up, when we didn\xE2\u20AC\u2122t say \xE2\u20AC\u0153I love you!\xE2\u20AC\x9D When we should\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve said \xE2\u20AC\u0153I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m Sorry!\xE2\u20AC\x9D So there\xE2\u20AC\u2122s a time for silence, there\xE2\u20AC\u2122s a time to wait your turn.  But if you so clearly know how you feel and so clearly know what you need to say you\xE2\u20AC\u2122ll know it.  I don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t think you should wait, I think you should Speak Now.  \xE2\u20AC\u201C Taylor Swift"
