function = "The concept of the project is to create a SF Giants 2010 World Series plaque.  There will be two sheets of 3mm acrylic that you will glue together.  I will be using the CNC laser printer to print this from Illustrator.  On the front there will be a vector cut of the logo.  This will be cut on black acrylic and then the inside logo cut out will be removed.  The orange flurescent piece will fit through the logo and photos will be added behind it.\r\n        For the back (separate sheet of acrylic) will have \"San Franciso Giants 2010 World Series Champions\".  You will need a two 10x10 sheets of black acrylic for this and also one sheet of 10x10 of an orange flurescent for the front design.  A clear 11x11 piece of acrylic is needed to be cut to place the pictures on.  Before printing the design, I will make sure everything is centered and perfect in symmetry.  The goal of my project is to make create a nice plaque for my dad and brother to have."
