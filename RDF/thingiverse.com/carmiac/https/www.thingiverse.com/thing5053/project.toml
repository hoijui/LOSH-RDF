Celebrate Festivus with your own open source parametric pole holder!\r\n\r\nAlso included is an optional Festivus pole, if you need one and don't mind printing it out of plastic instead of the traditional Aluminium.\r\n\r\nThe stl is made to hold a 20mm pole, but you can scale it in OpenSCAD to whatever size you need.\r\n\r\nThis thing will probably also work as base for a miniature Christmas tree, Yule Log, Menorah, or whatever."
