function: "Many holidays are based around the solstices and equinoxes.  If you celebrate any of these holidays, you might want to get in touch with some of the ancient ways of tracking the Sun.  This thing is a script to generate a solar calendar observatory that does something special on the solstices and, optionally, the equinoxes.\r\n\r\nIt comes in two flavors:  A \"standing stone\" and a \"cave\".  \r\n\r\nThe standing stone version has pairs of towers that the Sun will shine through and onto the gnomon at sunrise and sunset each solstice.  \r\n\r\nThe cave version has an outer shell with slits that the Sun shines through on the correct days.\r\n\r\nThe script is highly parameterized, letting you control all sorts of things about your observatory. \r\n\r\nAs a special bonus, I've included several pre-configured site locations special to ancient astronomy in the script.\r\n\r\nAs a super special bonus, I've included the option to create observatories for any of the eight major planets!  You know, just in case you happen to be off-Earth without a calendar.\r\n\r\nThe two included stl files are a standing stone style correct for Stonehenge, and a cave style correct for Fajada Butte, in honor of the ancient observatories built there.\r\n\r\nHappy Solstice!!!"
