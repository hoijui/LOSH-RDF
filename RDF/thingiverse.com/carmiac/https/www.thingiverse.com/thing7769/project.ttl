    okh:function """Sometimes you need an S hook.  Sometimes you need an S hook that is a very specific size.  Sometimes you need an S hook that has a specific opening.  Sometimes you need such specific S hooks that you spend the time to write a scad script to generate S hooks for you.  Sometimes it is too early in the morning and you haven't had coffee yet and you keep writing formulaic sentences about S hooks instead of writing the code that your boss wants you to.  Sometimes.\r

Update:\r
WilliamAAdams simplified the scad script and made it possible to have the hook opening > 180 degrees.  The s_hook1.2.scad contains his work.  Thanks William!""" ;
