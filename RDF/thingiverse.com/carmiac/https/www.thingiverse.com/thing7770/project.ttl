While I've learned to live with the odd noises, lights and sense of impending madness, the shower curtain has been a problem.  See, the bathroom walls aren't quite straight so I can't get a tension rod to stay up in place. \r
\r
So, I designed this thing.  The bottom rectangle is sized for a large waterproof 3M Command strip, and the top is just the right size for most standard tension rods.""" ;
