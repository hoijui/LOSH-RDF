function = "The venerable Cupcake is MakerBot Industries first 3D printer.  Over the years a huge number of upgrades for it have been designed and posted on Thingiverse and around the web.  This is a collection of the best and most important upgrades for your Cupcake to improve its performance and keep it running well.  \r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, I didn't come up with any of these upgrades .  I'm just compiling them into one place.  \r\n\r\nI need your help!  I don't own a Cupcake, so I created this list from perusing Thingiverse and the MBI forums.  There are great upgrades out there that are missing because I don't know about them, and some of these might not be the best choice because I can't test them.  Help out by letting me know what I am missing or should change\r\n\r\nLooking for Thing-O-Matic upgrades? Check out http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6443\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG:\r\n5/18/2011 - Initial Release\r\n5/26/2011 - Mendel style outriggers and typos.\r\n6/29/2011 - Added alternate Z wobble arrestor, Z Knob, and Z-Rider"
