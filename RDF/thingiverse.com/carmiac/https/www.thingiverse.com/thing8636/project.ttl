    okh:function """The venerable Cupcake is MakerBot Industries first 3D printer.  Over the years a huge number of upgrades for it have been designed and posted on Thingiverse and around the web.  This is a collection of the best and most important upgrades for your Cupcake to improve its performance and keep it running well.  \r
\r
Unless otherwise noted, I didn't come up with any of these upgrades .  I'm just compiling them into one place.  \r
\r
I need your help!  I don't own a Cupcake, so I created this list from perusing Thingiverse and the MBI forums.  There are great upgrades out there that are missing because I don't know about them, and some of these might not be the best choice because I can't test them.  Help out by letting me know what I am missing or should change\r
