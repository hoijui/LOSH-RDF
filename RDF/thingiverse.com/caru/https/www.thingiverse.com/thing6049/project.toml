function = "This is a spool, developed in OpenSCAD, that can be used to build a solenoid (aka electromagnet) with enameled copper wire. It has two holes on each base, used to insert the wire and to hook it once the solenoid has been rolled. The wire can also help to keep the two pieces together, but I am not sure if that will be enough. Probably gluing them together is safer.\r\n\r\nOf course, it can also be used as a generic spool for any kind of wire.\r\n\r\nYou can modify the following parameters:\r\ni_diameter: the internal (core) diameter\r\no_diameter: the outer diameter, on which the solenoid will be twisted\r\ni_height: the internal height between bases\r\nbase_diameter: the bases diameter\r\nbase_thickness: the thickness of the bases\r\nin_hole_offset: the offset of the first hole, where the wire will enter\r\nout_hole_offset: the offset of the second hole, where the wire will exit\r\nhole_diameter: the holes diameter\r\nwedge_height: the height of the wedge\r\nwedge_thickness: the thickness of the wedge\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nsolenoid(14, 18, 50, 50, 4, 12, 20, 4);\r\ntranslate([51, 0, 0]) base_only(50, 4, 14, 18, 13, 20, 4, 8, 4);\r\n\r\nThanks to all the guys in #reprap IRC for their suggestions!"
