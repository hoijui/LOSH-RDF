function = "With this thing, you can make shot glasses made of ice.\r\n\r\nIt is made in OpenSCAD and it's fully parametric.\r\n\r\nChanges in version 1.1:\r\n- added a centralWedgeSpace parameter, default to 1 mm, as per Linkreincarnate's feedback (pot_1.0.stl is not changed, you can print it)\r\n- slightly changed the algorithm that positions the caps near the pot, eg when rendering both together\r\n\r\nChanges in version 1.2:\r\n- fixed a bug: the chosen glass thickness was right only at the top border of the glass (pot_1.0.stl is not changed, you can print it)"
