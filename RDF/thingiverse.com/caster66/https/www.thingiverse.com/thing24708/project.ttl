    okh:function """So I decided to build myself a relatively cheap workbench using Ikea's Antonius line of furniture. I saw that they had a nice little rack system for drawers, a 4 ft table top, and a set of legs and I thought Perfect! Bought two sets of everything planning to make an 8ft bench with lots of storage underneath.\r
\r
When I got them home to assemble them, lo and behold even though they were from the same system they were not designed to play nice together or at least the way I wanted them to.\r
\r
The shelf units were designed to only work with the short top that only covers the top of the unit. The legs were designed to work with the table top but were designed to work with a wall mount system that I was unable/unwilling to use.\r
\r
My answer was to drill out the holes needed to attach the bases and screw them down. Then print off these adapters to allow the legs to be attached anywhere you want them. There is two sets of holes in each leg for attaching the wall mount leg section so I appropriated them to attach this adapter. You can use one or both. I included both for strength. The adapter needs to be attached to the underside of the table top before attaching the leg.\r
\r
I just got my Prusa finished so haven't had a chance to print these off yet but they should work. There is two versions. One with a flange so it can be screwed down with 4 screws and one with a single screw hole in the center of the adapter. I wasn't really sure which one would be best. Will print and test them both when I can.""" ;
