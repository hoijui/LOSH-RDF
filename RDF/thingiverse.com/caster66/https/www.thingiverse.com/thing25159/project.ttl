\r
I had just been laying the boards in the tank but I wanted to be able to etch multiple boards and to use a bubbler to increase the speed I was etching and so this rack was born.\r
\r
The large slot underneath is for three aquarium stones.\r

Personally I do not use Ferric Chloride as it is a very nasty chemical that is toxic and difficult to dispose of. I use Ammonium Persulphate instead. Its just as cheap and available and comes in a powder so it has an indefinate shelf life. Disposal is as simple as flushing it down the drain. I have recently been evaporating off the water and it leaves behind pretty blue crystals.""" ;
