function: "Just some parametric and printable key rings modeled in openSCAD.org\r\n\r\nThe trinket is my way of wishing makerbot happy holidays and it was printed before our extruder ran into some trouble a few days ago. I've also modeled icons for other projects I got to know and love (miniature reprap mendel, thingiverse's gear logo, openMaterials logo), and I'm just waiting to be able to print them before uploading those files."
