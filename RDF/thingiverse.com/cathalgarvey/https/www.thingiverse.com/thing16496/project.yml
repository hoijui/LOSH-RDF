function: "Note: The original description of this virus inaccurately described and named bacteriophage T7, a temperate phage that has seen different uses in molecular biology. Apologies, I'm not sure how I made such a fundamental mistake, given how the viruses even look quite distinctly different..\r\n\r\nUses the Icosahedron script from whosawhatsis, which was\r\nkindly shared under a CC-BY-SA license also. Original script is available here:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing%3A12097\r\n\r\nThis is a model of Bacteriophage T4, an organism in genetics that has\r\nbeen used for decades in labs around the world. Enzymes and genetic systems derived from T4 have seen extensive use in-vitro, such as T4 DNA ligase, which is used for joining lengths of DNA together.\r\n\r\nThese days, T4 doesn't get nearly as much attention, but it's still an incredible\r\nmicro-organism; a futuristic, spaceship-shaped virus that can lie in wait for generations hidden in the genome of an unsuspecting E.coli cell, awaiting the day that it erupts into infectious disease.\r\n\r\nThis model is available on Shapeways for purchase:\r\nhttp://www.shapeways.com/model/452247/bacteriophage_t7_model.html"
