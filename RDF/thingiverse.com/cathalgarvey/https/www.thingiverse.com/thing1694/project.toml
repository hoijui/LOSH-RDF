Derivatives are expected to be likewise free.\r\nGel Electrophoresis is a staple procedure in modern genetic and molecular biology practise. It involves casting a \\\"gel\\\" made of Agarose (super-pure Agar, it is possible to just use Agar-Agar also) which contains a dye that binds DNA, and then forcing lengths of DNA through the Gel with a voltage so that they separate by size and collect dye. They can then be photographed and analysed.\r\n\r\nElectrophoresis requires Agarose/Agar, a Dye (such as the commonly available methyline blue, or the more hazardous Ethidium Bromide or Sybr-Safe/Sybr-Green), and equipment that should only cost about â‚¬50 but is in fact priced closer to â‚¬500 at least. The least of this equipment is the casting set used to make the gel and sit it in the tank of conductive buffer, which is what this Thing comprises.\r\n\r\nThe HobbyGel Casting Kit is composed of a small Gel Boat (with a footprint of 5cm X 6cm) and a selection of \\\"combs\\\" used to cast the \\\"wells\\\" into which the DNA is injected prior to applying voltage. Depending on the number of samples needing to be Electrophoresed, one can print combs with more teeth or multiple combs.\r\n\r\nAlso included in this Thing is the larger cousin of the HobbyGel, the LabCompat Gel Casting Kit, which is sized to fit the somewhat-standard \\\"Bio-Rad Mini-Sub Cell-GT\\\" Electrophoresis Rig.\r\n\r\nBoth sets are available from my shop, Labs From Fabs;\r\nhttp://www.shapeways.com/shops/labsfromfabs\r\nI have priced them as competitively as I can, so that a full HobbyGel kit comprising a 7-Well Comb and a Casting Boat should cost $59.73 in Europe, less elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI intend to have both available for order in a choice of either opaque, tough plastic or transluscent acrylic. It is my hope that the latter is UV-permeable enough to allow easy transillumination, while the former will be much cheaper but will call for the trivial additional step of removing the gel from the cast before illuminating with UV. (If required! See below for links to home-brew DNA extraction/visualisation projects requiring no such UV and no Agarose!)"
