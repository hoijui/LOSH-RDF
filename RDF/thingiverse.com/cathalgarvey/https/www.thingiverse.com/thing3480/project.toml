function = "I got featured on Thingiverse! Also, now for sale on Shapeways!\r\n\r\nA fairly simple sculpture of DNA, built on a stand so you can use it as a nerdy desk ornament or as a teaching aid. Or as an aspirational goal, if you\\'re anything like me (\"I will best you yet, DNA!\")\r\n\r\nThe Makerbot-printed versions are not technically correct, but all told, it's a modestly accurate representation, although the real thing is more dense and complex. And constantly under assault/revision by proteins and nosy scientists. I've included a version of the molecule which roughly corresponds to the common, active form in cells, called \"B-DNA\".\r\n\r\nIf you've only ever seen those pictures of DNA that look like a ladder twisted along its virtual axis, welcome to the slightly quirkier reality! If you like this kinda stuff, check out DIYbio.org. If you live on the West Coast and want a Bio-Hackerspace to play in, support \"Biocurious\" on Kickstarter!\r\n\r\nI have put this model on Shapeways for those who might want a premium model in acrylic, glass, steel or plated gold!\r\nhttp://www.shapeways.com/model/134213/dna_sculpture.html"
