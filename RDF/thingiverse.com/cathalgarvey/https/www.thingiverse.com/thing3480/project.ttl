\r
A fairly simple sculpture of DNA, built on a stand so you can use it as a nerdy desk ornament or as a teaching aid. Or as an aspirational goal, if you\\'re anything like me ("I will best you yet, DNA!")\r
\r
The Makerbot-printed versions are not technically correct, but all told, it's a modestly accurate representation, although the real thing is more dense and complex. And constantly under assault/revision by proteins and nosy scientists. I've included a version of the molecule which roughly corresponds to the common, active form in cells, called "B-DNA".\r
\r
If you've only ever seen those pictures of DNA that look like a ladder twisted along its virtual axis, welcome to the slightly quirkier reality! If you like this kinda stuff, check out DIYbio.org. If you live on the West Coast and want a Bio-Hackerspace to play in, support "Biocurious" on Kickstarter!\r
\r
I have put this model on Shapeways for those who might want a premium model in acrylic, glass, steel or plated gold!\r
