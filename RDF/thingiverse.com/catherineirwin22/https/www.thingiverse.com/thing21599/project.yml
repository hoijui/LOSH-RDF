function: "The geometric design is an extension from my own contemporary fine art practice. \r\nYou can print the design onto your desired material to create or decorate as you wish! \r\nFor example you could print the piece on canvas or paper to make an artwork yourself. Or you could print the design onto various interior decorative objects, such as on a cushion, lampshade or even as a wallpaper design! The possibilities are endless..."
