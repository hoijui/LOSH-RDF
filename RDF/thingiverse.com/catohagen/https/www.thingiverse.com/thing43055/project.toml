function = "A little extruder gear for the extruder stepmotor for the Ultimaker.\r\nI liked the design from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40334 but without the herringbone gears, so I duplicated this model but without the herringbone gears. Assembey is pretty straighforward. It have the D shaped hole to press onto the shaft and then you can mount a M3 10mm or so leftover bolt from your ultimaker kit as a set screw(theres a slot for M3 nut on the backside)"
