    okh:function """This is a female fitting for attaching to a threaded garden hose. The thread is an attempt at the 3/4" GHT. Thanks to http://www.thingiverse.com/billybob for the thread profile information.  http://www.thingiverse.com/bluemetal took the plunge and reported that the threads do work. There is provision for a rubber washer (up to 2.5mm thick) to create the seal. Explanation for each of the files is given below. \r

In itself, this is fairly useless.  I created it so that it can be merged with other objects. Maybe make a plant sprayer. My ultimate goal would be to create a printable lawn sprinkler, as http://www.thingiverse.com/supermange proposed in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10127. \r
\r
These were created in SolidEdge, so I can upload native or other file formats per requests. If there is a particular adaptation that you would like to see, let me know and I'll see what I can do.\r

Solid: This is a basic cap. It was created to allow for the testing of the seal under pressure. It also can be modified to have any desired outlet. \r
