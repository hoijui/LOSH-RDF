function: "There have been a influx of hook objects, so I figured I should throw my design into the mix.  I recently moved into a room with wire shelves in the (smallish) closet.  Wanting to maximize my storage options, I designed these hangers to hook onto the shelves.  The hooks have a diameter of 30 and 50mm.  The attachment point is made for 6-7mm diameter rod, but the hook could be scaled for any other size.  It is a tight press-on fit, so the hook does not come of the shelf accidentally.  The hook has a 5x10mm rectangular cross-section.\r\n\r\nI will try to upload photos when I get home and time allows (The move is still in progress).\r\n\r\nThe three attached files each contain two hooks, the hook diameter given in the file title."
