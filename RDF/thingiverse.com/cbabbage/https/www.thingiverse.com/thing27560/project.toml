function = "This is a spinal column tea light holder.  My wife asked me for a candle similar to one seen in the fourth Harry Potter movie, so I modified a free skeleton model into this candle holder.  I have sliced it to fit on my Thing-O-Matic platform and print without raft or support.  I then glued it together with acetone."
