function = "I find that the MakerBot does poorly when printing small circles with lots of vertices.  It tends to slow down unnecessarily, which makes things too thick.\r\n\r\nI imported Will's z-stage guide into Blender and manually refined the mesh.  Now the M3 bolt holes have 8 vertices, instead of 32.  With careful use of the Stretch module in Skeinforge, the holes come out perfect."
