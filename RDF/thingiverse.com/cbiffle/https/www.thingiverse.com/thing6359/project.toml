function = "This is a replacement case and faceplate for the NuForce Icon ÂµDAC-2.  It's designed with thin walls for PLA, so it shows off the circuitry.\r\n\r\nA friend commissioned this work.  He purchased a NuForce Icon ÂµDAC-2 USB audio device without a case -- it's 50% cheaper without the case, apparently: http://estore.nuforce.com/products/Icon-uDAC-to-uDac2-Upgrade.html\r\n\r\nYour 3D printer just saved you 60 bucks.\r\n\r\nUpdate: you will also need a backplate to make it all pretty and sealed.  I hope to post a backplate shortly."
