function = "Upon purchasing the Plastruder MK5, I was bewildered to discover that there's nowhere to mount the actual control electronics.  (I still have no idea what MakerBot Industries was thinking with this one.)\r\n\r\nI rewired and hung the EC off the side of the bot, which is a reasonable configuration with the new relay board.  This is the mount I used.  I didn't post it initially because it's ridiculously simple..but it's so much simpler than the other EC mounts on here that I thought it might be useful to someone!"
