\r
I rewired and hung the EC off the side of the bot, which is a reasonable configuration with the new relay board.  This is the mount I used.  I didn't post it initially because it's ridiculously simple..but it's so much simpler than the other EC mounts on here that I thought it might be useful to someone!""" ;
