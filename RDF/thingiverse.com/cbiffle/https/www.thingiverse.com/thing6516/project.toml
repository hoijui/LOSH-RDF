function = "This OpenSCAD script can generate variations on Oscar ReutersvÃ¤rd's 1934 optical illusion.  My approach was inspired by a picture of Artur Tchoukanov's model that I saw in the news (which in turn was inspired by Ulrich Schwanitz).  Unfortunately, the news article didn't include the math behind the illusion's construction (they so rarely do!), so I had to rederive everything from scratch.\r\n\r\nFortunately it took only a few minutes of basic geometry.  This program demonstrates the math behind the illusion; it can generate triangles of arbitrary size and complexity.\r\n\r\nAfter some research, it seems that all these figures are in fact inspired by the work of Marcel Duchamp, who was producing impossible-figure photographs by playing with concavity/convexity as early as 1950.  Duchamp's techniques are presented alongside the ReutersvÃ¤rd illusion in this 2004 article: http://www.toutfait.com/online_journal_details.php?postid=1375\r\n\r\nI learn something new every day!"
