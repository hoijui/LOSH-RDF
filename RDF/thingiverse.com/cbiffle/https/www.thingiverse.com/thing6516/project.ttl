    okh:function """This OpenSCAD script can generate variations on Oscar ReutersvÃ¤rd's 1934 optical illusion.  My approach was inspired by a picture of Artur Tchoukanov's model that I saw in the news (which in turn was inspired by Ulrich Schwanitz).  Unfortunately, the news article didn't include the math behind the illusion's construction (they so rarely do!), so I had to rederive everything from scratch.\r
\r
Fortunately it took only a few minutes of basic geometry.  This program demonstrates the math behind the illusion; it can generate triangles of arbitrary size and complexity.\r
\r
After some research, it seems that all these figures are in fact inspired by the work of Marcel Duchamp, who was producing impossible-figure photographs by playing with concavity/convexity as early as 1950.  Duchamp's techniques are presented alongside the ReutersvÃ¤rd illusion in this 2004 article: http://www.toutfait.com/online_journal_details.php?postid=1375\r
