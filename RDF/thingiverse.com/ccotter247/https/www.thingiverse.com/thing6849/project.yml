function: "This model was created to test the amount of overhang your printer can handle. This is work in progress so more models will be uploaded when I have the time. For now this is a 50 mm high object with a base of 20 mm and an overhang of 45\xCB\u0161 degrees. Correct me if I'm wrong but, in theory if this cannot be printed then you layer hieght needs to be decreased. I currently am rebuilding my hot end so I will not be able to print this for a few days. When I do get a chance I will print this and upload some pics.\r\n\r\nPrint time is Approximately: 1 hr. 22 min. \r\n\r\nBlog: http://thepowerofmaking.blogspot.com"
