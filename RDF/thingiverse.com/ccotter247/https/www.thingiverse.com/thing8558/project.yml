function: With Makerfaire coming up I was thinking about how I will be able to recognize other 3D printer operators. Since we all don't usually go by our usernames I thought about how we could use our machines to recognize each other. So I created this nifty little 3D printer operator badge. So print one out and wear it to Makerfaire to show your pride for 3D printing. This is also a great conversation starter! Plus it is in the Makerfaire colors!! Wear one to Makerfaire if you 3D print!!!
