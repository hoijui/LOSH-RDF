function = "I took the standard Mendel front-mount PCB sheet and put it 'flush' with the 60 degree frame rods to free up some space.\r\n\r\nThis fan mount fits the two slotted features in the std Mendel PCB sheet and assumes that your RAMPS assembly is mounted close by!\r\n\r\nIt's nice because it's nice and flexy, and if you need to fool around with your connections, just bend it away! It shall return to swifly cool those heat sinks."
