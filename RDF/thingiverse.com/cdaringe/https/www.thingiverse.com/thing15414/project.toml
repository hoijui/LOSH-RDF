function = "This is a drop-in replacement for the standard mendel x-carriage.  It is is inspired by Buback's OpenX Carriage with the following mods:\r\n\r\n1) Integrated belt tensioner\r\n2) Fan mounting\r\n3) Some silly features that I think look somewhat artsy/blingin.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the design was to incorporate the 40+mm square space to fit larger profile extruders, while giving the carriage some steez."
