function = "This design improves on the last Bling Carriage by:\r\n(a) adding captured M3 nut cavities for the tensioner(s)\r\n(b)Adding some extra space for the belt to pass thru!\r\n(c) most importantly!, on the non-tension side, add a flex member to ensure top+bottom bearing contact (reduce wobble about the x-axis)\r\n---\r\nThis is ALSO a drop-in replacement for the standard mendel x-carriage. It is is inspired by Buback's OpenX Carriage with the following mods:\r\n\r\n1) Integrated belt tensioner\r\n2) Fan mounting\r\n3) Some silly features that I think look somewhat artsy/blingin.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the design was to incorporate the 40+mm square space to fit larger profile extruders, while giving the carriage some steez.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI included only the full plate.  I'll try and put up the individual pieces later.  Hopefully you like it!"
