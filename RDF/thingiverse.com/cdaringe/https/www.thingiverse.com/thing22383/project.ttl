    okh:function """This design improves on the last Bling Carriage by:\r
(a) adding captured M3 nut cavities for the tensioner(s)\r
(b)Adding some extra space for the belt to pass thru!\r
(c) most importantly!, on the non-tension side, add a flex member to ensure top+bottom bearing contact (reduce wobble about the x-axis)\r
---\r
This is ALSO a drop-in replacement for the standard mendel x-carriage. It is is inspired by Buback's OpenX Carriage with the following mods:\r
\r
1) Integrated belt tensioner\r
2) Fan mounting\r
3) Some silly features that I think look somewhat artsy/blingin.\r
\r
The intent of the design was to incorporate the 40+mm square space to fit larger profile extruders, while giving the carriage some steez.\r
\r
---\r
I included only the full plate.  I'll try and put up the individual pieces later.  Hopefully you like it!""" ;
