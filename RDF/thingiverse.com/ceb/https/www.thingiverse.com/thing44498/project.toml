function = "OK here is another new version of the X axis for reprappro. The difference is not only is the IM8UU being used in the  X Axis but since I live in the â€œthird worldâ€x9d when it comes to measurement - AKA the â€œUS of Aâ€x9d  I can't get metric parts easily like the M5  threaded rod. It turns out the best I can do at least going to a â€œHome Depotâ€x9d is to get a Â¼ rod thread so that is now what I am giving anyone that wants it. I will provide calculations for the steppers when I do them but until then here is a IM8UU based X axis with Â¼  rod for Xaxis."
