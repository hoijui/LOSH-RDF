function: "OK here is another new version of the X axis for reprappro. The difference is not only is the IM8UU being used in the  X Axis but since I live in the \xE2\u20AC\u0153third world\xE2\u20AC\x9D when it comes to measurement - AKA the \xE2\u20AC\u0153US of A\xE2\u20AC\x9D  I can't get metric parts easily like the M5  threaded rod. It turns out the best I can do at least going to a \xE2\u20AC\u0153Home Depot\xE2\u20AC\x9D is to get a \xC2\xBC rod thread so that is now what I am giving anyone that wants it. I will provide calculations for the steppers when I do them but until then here is a IM8UU based X axis with \xC2\xBC  rod for Xaxis."
