function: This is remix of the another power cover. That cover is great but I wanted to make a few changes. The original cover was solid with a hole to run the wiring through. I left area under the cage open to run the wires so threading a hole was not necessary. Also this is a big print I modified the solid walls to save plastic and also to make the inner LED light visible through grates. The switch wiring is pretty strait forward and the plug switch combination illuminates. Watch the wiring as the original model I extended this from was wired wrong so the light in the switch did not illuminate.
