function = "This is a enhancement/alteration of the already nicely designed Fan Shroud from \"lampmaker\" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9515). \r\nAs suggested by Wim de Groot I added some diagonal studs to make the bridgegap smaller and the thing easier to print.\r\nI also made to air outlet pointing towards (and right underneath) the extruder head. So the extruder should stay hot and the printed parts will cool down faster.\r\n\r\nIdeas welcome, as I can implement them in a version 3.x. \r\n\r\nI made mine with the current Sprinter Firmware and the \"Failsafe\" Profile with 90% infill."
