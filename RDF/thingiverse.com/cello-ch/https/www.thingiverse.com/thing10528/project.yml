function: "Something which belongs on every serious electronics fabber table is a 4 Channel Digital Storage Oscilloscope. For example the open source version from seeed (http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/dso-quad-4-channel-digital-storage-oscilloscope-p-736.html and featured on Thingiverse blog: http://blog.thingiverse.com/2011/04/13/open-source-spotlight-seeed-studio-dso-quad/).\r\nA perfect nice little thing to play around and for serious work as well. It is so tiny, its hard to put it in a right spot while using. Solution? Of course, fire up Alibre, design a stand, fire up Ultimaker and print it.\r\n\r\nIn case you own a DSO QUAD and a 3D printer go for it. If you just have the DSO QUAD, send me a mail, I might print one for you. And if you just have the 3D printer and no DSO QUAD yet - order one from seeedstudio, they might be on stock now."
