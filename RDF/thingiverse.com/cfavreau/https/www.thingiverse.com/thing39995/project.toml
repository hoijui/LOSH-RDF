function = "Keep your Perplexus from rolling off of flat surfaces.  A stand for your Perplexus Puzzle.   My Original Perplexus did not come with a hand dandy stand.  My Perplexus Epic did... and the Original one was jealous so I designed one in Cubify Invent.  The stand is just under 100 mm x 100 mm and will fit on the bed of a Thing O Matic.\r\n\r\nI have included one with a Plaque that says \"Perplexus Original\" and one that is plain.  Also included is the Cubify Invent .FUN file."
