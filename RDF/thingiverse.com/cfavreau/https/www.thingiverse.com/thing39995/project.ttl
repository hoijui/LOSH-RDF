My Perplexus Epic did... and the Original one was jealous so I designed one in Cubify Invent.  The stand is just under 100 mm x 100 mm and will fit on the bed of a Thing O Matic.\r
\r
I have included one with a Plaque that says "Perplexus Original" and one that is plain.  Also included is the Cubify Invent .FUN file.""" ;
