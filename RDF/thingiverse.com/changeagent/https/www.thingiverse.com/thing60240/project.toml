function = "Since there is no limit to manipulating the topology of an object in 3D space, an infinite array of sound diffusing possibilities exist.  This is a\r\n  2 layer 12 inch by 12 inch 3D acoustic tile. The sound is directed through circular and diamond shaped ports and then diffused over an array of hemispheres.  It would be optimal to use porus materials similar to foam."
