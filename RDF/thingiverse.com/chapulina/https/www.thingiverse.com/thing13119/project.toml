function = "After my printable Rubik's cubes, I'd been planning to design and print a snake cube - a puzzle which is basically a string of cubes that when solved form a bigger cube.  \n\nBefore I could design it though, epideath uploaded his own design to Thngiverse, saving me the trouble. But when I started printing it, due to the details in the design I couldn't print it well using my Cupcake CNC. So I designed my own anyways.  \n\nMore pictures and information here:  \nhttp://myshumi.net/2011/10/31/snake-cube/"
