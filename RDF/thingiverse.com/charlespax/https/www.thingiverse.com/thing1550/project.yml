function: "Here's a handy little cardboard spool you can use for your MakerBot filament. I designed it for a thicker cardboard than pictured, but all I had around when I was inspired were some pizza boxes.\r\n\r\nAs posted on my blog http://charlespax.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/cardboard-spool/\r\n\r\nSee it in action as part of the future Bowden filament drive box http://charlespax.com/2010/01/26/makerbot-filament-box-and-drive-mechanism/\r\n\r\nThe latest version can be found in subversion at http://svn.makerbot.com/users/charles/bowden/ .\r\n\r\nEDIT 2010-03-21: I added a divider to the files. Thanks, Kevin. I also decreased the size of the hole that secures the filament to better grab the it."
