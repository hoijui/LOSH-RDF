function = "At the NYC Resistor laser cutting class I embedded one of Zach's planetary gears in one of Zach's planetary gears. This design was laser cut from black acrylic and sandwiched between two clear acrylic sheets.\r\n\r\nI found that the inner circle in the front layer needed a smaller diameter to rotate smoothly. I also cut a gasket that sits between the front and gear layers. Otherwise the gears always contact both the front and back layers.\r\n\r\nAfter class I took my project to dinner with a few friends where it was an interesting conversation piece.\r\n\r\nSomeone should turn these gears into something that can be 3-D printed."
