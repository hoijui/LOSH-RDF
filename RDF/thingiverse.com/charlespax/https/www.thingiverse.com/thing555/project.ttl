    okh:function """At the NYC Resistor laser cutting class I embedded one of Zach's planetary gears in one of Zach's planetary gears. This design was laser cut from black acrylic and sandwiched between two clear acrylic sheets.\r
\r
I found that the inner circle in the front layer needed a smaller diameter to rotate smoothly. I also cut a gasket that sits between the front and gear layers. Otherwise the gears always contact both the front and back layers.\r
\r
After class I took my project to dinner with a few friends where it was an interesting conversation piece.\r
\r
Someone should turn these gears into something that can be 3-D printed.""" ;
