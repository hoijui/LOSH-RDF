I cannibalized the screws from my extruder to hold the thing together!\r\n\r\nModifications\r\n. Electronics are mounted upside down in the bottom cavity with the power supply\r\n. All four sides are open\r\n. The bottom plate comes straight off after removing the screws\r\n. Acrylic letters are where \\\"MakerBot Industries\\\" would normally be.\r\n\r\nAfter a conversation with Adam I have been inspired to put the z axis drive system within the lower cavity.\r\n\r\nI get the electrons inside I had to laser cut holes into the middle layer in which I put standoffs that normally hold motherboards away from computer cases. The entire bottom was redesigned, so the bottom cover can be removed without taking off the side.\r\n\r\nWhile the SD card can be accessed, it does not currently do anything.\r\n\r\nSubversion http://svn.makerbot.com/users/charles/muffin/\r\n\r\nBlog: http://charlespax.wordpress.com/\r\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/charlespax"
