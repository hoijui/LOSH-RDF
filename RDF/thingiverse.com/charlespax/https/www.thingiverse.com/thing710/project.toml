function = "The tangram is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes, called tans, which are put together to form shapes. The objective of the puzzle is to form a specific shape (given only in outline or silhouette) using all seven pieces, which may not overlap.[1]\r\n\r\nMy nieces have a tangram book, but had lost the pieces, so I made a few copies on the NYC Resisor laser cutter.\r\n\r\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram"
