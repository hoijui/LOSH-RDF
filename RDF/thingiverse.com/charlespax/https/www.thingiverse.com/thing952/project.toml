function = "This is a small wooden box I made while learning the box-making process. The design allows the box top to be placed on the bottom in any orientation without disrupting the checkered pattern. Also, all four sides are identical, as are the top and bottom. I did this so I wouldn't have to keep track of which part belongs where."
