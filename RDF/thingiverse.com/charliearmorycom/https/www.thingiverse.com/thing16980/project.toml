function = "This adapter lets you mount your Droid smartphone on a tripod for taking pictures or shooting video.\r\n\r\nWorks in either landscape or portrait positions.  Buttons and USB port are accessible.  Mounts on any standard tripod with a 1/4 20 thread.\r\n\r\nI have one of the original Motorola Droids with the slide-out keyboard.  It is 11.5 x 6 x 1.5cm.  If your phone has different dimensions you may need to modify the design slightly.\r\n\r\nTo get a better look at it, see the following video:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp-luPM1UmM"
