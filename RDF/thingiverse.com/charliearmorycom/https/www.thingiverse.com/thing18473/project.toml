function = "This is similar to Marcus Wolschon's toolhead adapter\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9491 except that this is designed to hold a Foredom flex-shaft rather than a Dremel.  The Foredom has better bearings and exhibits less tool wobble than a Dremel.\r\n\r\nThere is also a 1/2 inch hole for a piece of vinyl tubing to be connected to a vacuum.\r\n\r\nI will be using this setup to mill PC boards, but there are many other possibilities.\r\n\r\nI suggest that you use Marcus Wolschon's removable build platform and PCB vise rather than accidentally drilling a hole through your automated build platform.  :)\r\n\r\nThis is a 10x10cm print, so make sure your nozzle is perfectly centered when you calibrate your Thing-O-Matic.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 2-20-13:\r\n\r\nI added a photo of a PC board that I made using this tool.  I layed out the board in Eagle PCB and made the makerbot G-Code to route the traces using Visolate.\r\n\r\nI did not end up using the PCB vise, instead I drilled holes in the board and screwed it directly to the build platform carrier.  Considering the high precision needed for these surface mount chips (which are finer pitch than SOICs) I felt that more support on the backside of the board would be useful."
