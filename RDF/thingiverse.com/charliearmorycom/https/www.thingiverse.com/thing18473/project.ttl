    okh:function """This is similar to Marcus Wolschon's toolhead adapter\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9491 except that this is designed to hold a Foredom flex-shaft rather than a Dremel.  The Foredom has better bearings and exhibits less tool wobble than a Dremel.\r
\r
There is also a 1/2 inch hole for a piece of vinyl tubing to be connected to a vacuum.\r
\r
I will be using this setup to mill PC boards, but there are many other possibilities.\r
\r
I suggest that you use Marcus Wolschon's removable build platform and PCB vise rather than accidentally drilling a hole through your automated build platform.  :)\r
\r
This is a 10x10cm print, so make sure your nozzle is perfectly centered when you calibrate your Thing-O-Matic.\r
\r
\r
Update 2-20-13:\r
\r
I added a photo of a PC board that I made using this tool.  I layed out the board in Eagle PCB and made the makerbot G-Code to route the traces using Visolate.\r
\r
I did not end up using the PCB vise, instead I drilled holes in the board and screwed it directly to the build platform carrier.  Considering the high precision needed for these surface mount chips (which are finer pitch than SOICs) I felt that more support on the backside of the board would be useful.""" ;
