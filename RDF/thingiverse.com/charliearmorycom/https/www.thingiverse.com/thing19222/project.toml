function = "I'm using this with Marcus Wolschon's PCB vise http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9280 but you could use it with any project that requires a knob or crank handle.\r\n\r\nI'm using a 5/16 inch carriage bolt in place of Marcus' M8 threaded rod because it's easier to find in hardware stores in the U.S..\r\n\r\nI also have a couple different lengths so I don't have to have a long bolt hanging out of the side if it's holding a large PCB.\r\n\r\nI'm also using 1/8 inch smooth rod in place of the M4 smooth rod.  It fits just fine into the existing holes without modification."
