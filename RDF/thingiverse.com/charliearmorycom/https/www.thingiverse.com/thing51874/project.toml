function = "A whole set of measuring spoons can be printed in custom sizes.  Two different types are available.  One can can sit flat on the counter without falling over, but they don't nest inside one another.  The other type nests, but on extrusion printers you'll need to print it with support material to keep it from falling in on itself.  You can also print a sweep for leveling powder and a coupling to make a handy ring.\r\n\r\nOf course the flat on counter version won't sit flat if you put them on a ring.\r\n\r\nThere are also more settings you can change in the OpenSCAD file other than just the ones available in customizer.\r\n\r\nYou can choose any sizes you want, but common sizes are: \r\n\r\n1/8 tsp, 1/4 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp, 1/2 tbsp and 1 tbsp\r\n\r\nIf you're not interested in customizing and just want a set right away, download the .stl file.  It contains the following pieces:\r\n\r\n1/8 tsp, 1/4 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp, 1 tbsp and a ring coupler.  (All are U.S. sizes, for imperial measures, use the customizer.)\r\n\r\nThese are the sit flat type and support material is not needed.  The thickness is 2mm.\r\n\r\nThey are arranged in such a way that they fit on a Thing-O-Matic build platform.  It's a large build, so make sure that your platform is properly centered when you calibrate your printer."
