function: "I like many printed up belt tentioners from thingverse. Most worked fine but after a while they warped and got loose. I also had issues with them hitting the heads when they did get loose and wreck 12 hour print jobs.\r\nThese clips I designed use the existing belt tension design and add some height to the sides."
