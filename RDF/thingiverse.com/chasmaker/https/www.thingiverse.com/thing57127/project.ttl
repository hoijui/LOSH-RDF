    okh:function """I really wanted to convert my Ultimaker to a 1.75mm system. Way easier to find a variety of filament in the states. SeeMeCNC had a dual purpose extruder which handles 3mm and 1.75. They also have a nice hot endsetup for a bowden style printer that allows me to use smaller nozzles and they also sell blanks for making your own. The advantages of this setup is it only takes 30 seconds to swap out the hotend. I made an accessary clip that goes in the second hotend slot for a micrometer. You could also make this hold a pen or some sort of digital bed leveler etc.\r
FYI this will reduce your print area slightly. The Y and X print area is reduced by 1/2" but you gain about 1/2" in height.\r
Fan shroud and brackets are now in. There is a left and right and a double that will print on an unmodified UM.""" ;
