function = "This is my first thing and more of an experiment with Solidworks, my RepRapPro Huxley, and Thingverse but I hope it will be useful to someone as well. I have used it for holding gluing models.\r\n\r\nThis is a printable G clamp which consists of any metric machine screw and nut and a printed \"G\".\r\nI have set it up using well labeled equations in Solidworks so you can easily resize it for any metric size. It comes set up for M4."
