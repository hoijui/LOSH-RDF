function = "I made this fan mount for my RepRapPro Huxley. It holds a PC fan at 45 degrees (to point towards the hot end better). The stl is set up for a 60mm PC fan but can be changed in the solidworks part file.\r\n\r\nThanks to Richgain for the idea - I just customised all the dimensions for my much larger PC graphics card fan I had."
