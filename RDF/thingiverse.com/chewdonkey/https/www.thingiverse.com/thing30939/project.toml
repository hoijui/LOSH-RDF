function = "This is the front plastic cover for the front arm pivot pins on the HPI Firestorm. It is just a cap which stops the pin pivot which joins the wheel arm to the body coming out.\r\n\r\nThe original is one piece, this replacement is separated so you can just print one when only one side brakes, just install the other way up for the other side."
