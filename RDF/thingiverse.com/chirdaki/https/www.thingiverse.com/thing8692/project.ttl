    okh:function """The idea of a chalk outline is an old one and seems deeply ingrained on the public's psyche. Completely ignoring the usual reticence around dead people and anything to do with them, I have trivialised it to the point of being a nifty little keyring!\r
\r
Initial product reviews are promising:\r
"Hey cool, did you make that?" - Friend at work.\r
"How long did you spend on that?" - About 5 minutes, friend at uni.\r
"OMG! WTF?! GTFO!! I'm calling the cops!" - Person whose house I walked into accidently.\r
"Just keep emptying out your pockets please." - Cop.\r
In summary, 3/4 of people who saw it were interested in my new keyring, one to the point where they called a friend!""" ;
