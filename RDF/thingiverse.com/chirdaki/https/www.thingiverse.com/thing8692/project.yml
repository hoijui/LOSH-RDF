function: "The idea of a chalk outline is an old one and seems deeply ingrained on the public's psyche. Completely ignoring the usual reticence around dead people and anything to do with them, I have trivialised it to the point of being a nifty little keyring!\r\n\r\nInitial product reviews are promising:\r\n\"Hey cool, did you make that?\" - Friend at work.\r\n\"How long did you spend on that?\" - About 5 minutes, friend at uni.\r\n\"OMG! WTF?! GTFO!! I'm calling the cops!\" - Person whose house I walked into accidently.\r\n\"Just keep emptying out your pockets please.\" - Cop.\r\nIn summary, 3/4 of people who saw it were interested in my new keyring, one to the point where they called a friend!"
