function = "A handy phone stand.\r\n\r\nIt works okay with my HTC Desire but should work with others.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty simple but works okay. I think I may change it so the hands are tilted slightly further.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if I bent the thumbs in a bit but not quite sure how to do that yet. Is there any easy way to bend bits in an STL?\r\n\r\nAlso as my charger plugs in at the bottom the hands are not quite high enough to stop the spring the cable pusing the phone off. This may be improved with the hand pushed back a bit."
