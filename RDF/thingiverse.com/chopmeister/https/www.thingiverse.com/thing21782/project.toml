function = "This nice thing attaches to your Dremel and lets you make your own M8 knurled bolts for your extruder. Technically speaking it's a \"spiked\" bolt, not a knurled one, but it's close enough. :) And yes, the name is supercheesy, but I like it anyway.\r\n\r\nI made this because the standard Ultimaker knurled bolt doesn't fit the extruder I'm currently designing. \r\n\r\nIt's modelled in 3dsmax, so no openscad files, sorry :( If anybody wants to make a parametric version be my guest."
