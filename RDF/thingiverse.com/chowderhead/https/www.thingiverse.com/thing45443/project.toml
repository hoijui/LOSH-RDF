function = "Build your own colorimeter! More details can (will eventually) be found at http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_colorimeter. Note that present firmware only reports absorbance and transmittance; a calibration protocol is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMore and better to come...\r\n\r\nThe STLs will build a case for a colorimeter and the electronics BOM will yield a device designed for performing high range Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) determination, measuring absorbance at 606 nm, an absorbance peak for the chromic ion. The cuvette holder is designed for Hach COD digestion vials.\r\n\r\nThe light source was specifically chosen for chromic ion determination; it can be altered to measure other ions (aquarist: think nitrates, ammonia and pH). We're working on other designs and useful applications and invite you to join us and share your designs.\r\n\r\nColorimeters are exceptionally handy items used for determining the concentration of dissolved species typically in aqueous solutions. The principles of operation are simple and form the backbone of several other analytic methods.\r\nThis is part of a larger project to reduce the cost of scientific\r\nequipment using open-source hardware at Michigan Tech. Read a short\r\npiece published by Science talking about it:\r\nhttp://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1935580/Building_Research_Equipment_with_Free_Open-Source_Hardware.
