function = "There are some tools that are nice to have close to you when you're a MakerBot operator. I made this little tool rack that is easily mounted on the side of the MakerBot. It holds three sizes of allen keys; One for the M3, the M5 and the M8 bolts. It also has room for a little adjustable wrench and a standard flathead screwdriver for loosening or tightening the wires on your extruder board. It also has a hook that I use to hold the hot pad for handling my Heated Build Platform\r\n\r\nI've also provided the SketchUp source files, so feel free to modify and improve it!\r\n\r\nNOTE: there are two versions. One just have normal holes and hexagonal holes for the allen keys, while the other has drop-shaped holes to obey the 45-degree rule. I've actually found that with the right settings I was able to print the non-dropshaped fairly well, so that's the one I used."
