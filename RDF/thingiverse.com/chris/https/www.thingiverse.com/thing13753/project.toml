function = "This is designed particularly for city-dwelling ladies (or adventurous men). It slips over the tip of the heel to protect it en route to your final destination. You can apparently buy these for $10 from a number of places. Take that Big High-Heel Protector! \r\n\r\nThey're designed for heels with a roughly .45\" square tip (the test pair they were designed for - I don't really know what other sizes are out there).\r\n\r\nNow updated to be slightly rounded on the rear/side edges, to decrease scuffing."
