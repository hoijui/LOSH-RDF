function: This is designed to be screwed into a wall so that you can hang a wine glass from it and free up valuable cupboard space. This was designed to accomodate some comically large wine glasses given to us by my mother-in-law, so it should be pretty one-size-fits-all (May not work with wine glass that can hold an entire bottle featured in sky-mall. YMMV.)
