function: "This is version 2.0 of a 3-digit, base-10 register for an electromechanical computer I'm working on. It is stepper-driven, and works like a 3-digit counter, counting from 000-999 before rolling over. When all three digit wheels read '0-0-0', 3 reed switches will close and a circuit will be completed to detect the condition. \r\n\r\nThis one uses fewer parts and has at least been slightly tested. It also has larger digit surfaces for better visibility, and comes with printable labels!"
