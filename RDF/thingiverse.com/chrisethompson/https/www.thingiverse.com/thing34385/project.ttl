    okh:function """I have an old Garmin eTrex hand held GPS.  I must have got it 10 years ago at least.  It's very simple and good for keeping track of distance hiked or biked.  Unfortunately I lost the handlebar mount some where in the mists of time.  This is a replacement.\r
\r
I tried a couple of designs.  It was hard to get the overhanging tabs to work so that the GPS device would snap into place.  I used a fillet on the underside so that the overhanging pieces could be built out layer by layer.  That seemed to work.""" ;
