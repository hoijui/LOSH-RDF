function: "Having mounted my LED television on the wall I have a 80mm hole behind the TV, through which all the cables arrive.  No-one can see it of course, but I know it's there and it needs finishing, otherwise I might start muttering incoherently.  \r\n\r\nIt was designed in openscad and is fully parametric, it could doubtless be used for other purposes, including a desk grommet.  \r\n\r\nFeatures  \r\n--------  \r\n* Fully parametric  (see instructions for source files)  \r\n* Adjustable to fit any hole  \r\n* Parameters includes choice of 4, 2 or 0 clips  \r\n* Two part cap for easy insertion of cables  \r\n* Cap and Grommet are in separate modules (within the same scad file) so easy to print separately"
