function: "Sailing boats typically have plastic or rubber cylindrical covers for the lower part of the shrouds and stays (the wires that hold up the mast). These covers are called \"Turnbuckle Boots\".\r\n\r\nTurnbuckle boots should be topped off with caps, but it is quite common to see the caps broken or missing entirely.\r\n\r\nThis thing is a replacement for those caps. It is fully parametric and printed perfectly without support.\r\n\r\nSee pictures to see the printed result on my boat."
