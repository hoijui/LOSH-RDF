function: "This is a printable model of a physical version of our iPhone game, Foursies (http://www.4lwg.com/foursies), which itself is an electronic version of a variant of a physical game.  Bear with me... it will make sense, I promise!  \n\nFoursies is a four-in-a-row game with a twist: you play four boards at the same time, but you have to play in four different columns on each turn.  This video has a better explanation of how it works: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-rKtdY3Zmo  \n\nWe originally prototyped the game using four Connect 4 boards and some very rough \"blocker\" markers (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS1A2bsCZ2w).  After finishing the app, we thought it would be cool to try to create a printable model of the game.  \n\nTo be fair, the gameplay is designed for online play in a mobile app.  It's a little cumbersome to play with a physical set, because it requires you to keep track of which columns are played using up to nine blocker counters on a turn.  We made this BECAUSE WE CAN! :)  \n\nHowever, it's definitely playable so you still get to experience the unique strategy elements created by our rule variations, while playing on a table top with real people!"
