function = "Was looking for some lower cost plastic for my Replicator MakerBot. Turns Octave sells a bunch of colors on Amazon for reasonable prices. Unfortunately, after purchasing, I realized that the spool is of a different design than what you get from MakerBot. The spool is not only thicker, but has a much smaller hole. So what better solution than to make my own holder. So I cranked out a quick design based on the original MakerBot holder design, but one that fit the hole of the Octave spool."
