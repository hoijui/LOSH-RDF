function: "multi- digital fabrication machine for the studio(\xE2\u20AC\xA6hence the name: studio.FAB)  \r\nsome of the functions I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m including in the design:\r\n_3D printing\r\n_CNC/milling\r\n_thin material cutting (fabric, vinyl, paper, cardboard, etc)\r\n_plotter for inks, paints, graphite\r\n\r\n\r\nnow I know a lot of the all-in-one devices fall victim to the \xE2\u20AC\u0153jack-of-all-trades-but-master-of-none\xE2\u20AC\x9D syndrome (I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m looking at the bloated printerscannercopier that\xE2\u20AC\u2122s sitting on Robin\xE2\u20AC\u2122s desk\xE2\u20AC\xA6).  that\xE2\u20AC\u2122s why the studio.FAB isn\xE2\u20AC\u2122t exactly an all-in-one machine \xE2\u20AC\u201C instead, it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s more of a modular design that allows you to quickly and easily (\xE2\u20AC\xA6and I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m emphasizing that quick and easy part) switch the appropriate parts for the kind of making you want the machine to do. for example, if you want to move from 3D printing to CNC milling, it shouldn\xE2\u20AC\u2122t take you more than 10min. to swap out the belts and pulleys for a lead screw.\r\n\r\nthe studio.FAB is based on the open source RepRap platform.  I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m using 25mm extruded aluminum (t-slot) for the structural framework because it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s more stable and rigid than using threaded rod.  also, I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m designing it with an inverted-T structure (shared by other machines like the Aluminum Mendel, Rook, and Brian Blanton\xE2\u20AC\u2122s unnamed printer) \xE2\u20AC\u201C I think this makes it much easier to upgrade and swap out components when moving from one fabrication method to another (also: easier access to all the parts for repairs.)\r\none key difference b/w studio.FAB and most of the other machines I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve seen is how linear motion is handled.  the majority standard is to use a combination of smooth rods and bearings to get smooth motion, but (esp. on longer rods) smooth rods can flex, bend, and get out of alignment. I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve designed the studio.FAB to use the much less flexible t-slot as the linear bearing.  this is less critical when printing plastic, but can be an issue in subtractive processes like milling.\r\n\r\nI\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve been making steady progress, and right now I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m close to having all the core structural elements designed and built.  I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve had to design all the parts from scratch; even when I\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve had to reverse-engineer some derivative designs that use a different size t-slot, I found different solutions that seem to work better in this design.\r\nonce things are in a publishable state, I plan on writing up a pretty extensive overview of studio.FAB \xE2\u20AC\u201C followed by detailed instructions and a bill of materials so you can build your own.  right now though, I just wanted to make sure you got a small glimpse at what\xE2\u20AC\u2122s been happening in the studio for the past few months.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stardotstudio.com/2012/05/a-small-preview-studio-fab.html\r\n\r\n\r\ndefinitely more to come, including:\r\n_ linear bearings for t-slots"
