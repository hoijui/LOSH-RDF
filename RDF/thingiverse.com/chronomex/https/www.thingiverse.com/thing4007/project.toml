function = "I originally tried to build http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:973 , but RepSnapper disagreed with its geometry.\r\n\r\nThis drag chain link is 45mm wide, 29mm deep, and 77mm long overall.  The cross-section of the usable volume is 27mm wide and 25mm deep.  Each link has a useful length of 60mm.\r\n\r\nIt took about 45 minutes to print a single link with RepSnapper on a Mendel.  I printed two in a pre-assembled orientation and they fused, but separately printed ones snapp together with a little effort."
