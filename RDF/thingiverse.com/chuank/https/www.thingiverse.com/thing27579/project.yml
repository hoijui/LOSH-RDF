function: "Expandable Spool Rack\r\n\t\r\nI created this rack specifically for those 5lb/2.3kg filament spools that our filament usually comes in.\r\n\r\nThis stand is modular in that you can extend the width of your rack by using longer rod and printing more of the arms.\r\n\r\nThe arms are also ready for mounting upside down, i.e. under your worktable using M4 bolts. Good for those of us with limited workspace.\r\n\r\nOpenSCAD files have been provided so feel free to modify it anyway you like."
