function = "This bracket replaces the somewhat flimsy stock piece for the Solidoodle 2.  My factory brackets were both cracked and due to the lack of stability, it was causing poor accuracy/repeatability in the y-axis.\r\n\r\nThe overkill bracket is an even beefier piece.  Both work.  I've got one of each installed right now."
