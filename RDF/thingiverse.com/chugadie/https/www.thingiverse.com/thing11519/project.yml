function: "This is an evolution of the OpenSCAD rewrite by \"toomanyplugs\" of \"bubak\"'s original OpenX carriage.  This version includes:\r\n\r\ncaptive nut traps for most of the horizontal holes\r\nmore parametric variables (not completely finished)\r\nthicker cross beams and outer edge (to accommodate captive nuts)\r\nwider hole on the back clamp to feed x-axis belt through  (see update after printing)\r\n\r\nUpdated version:\r\nShorter incomplete polygons.  Should only be 3-4 layers of trick holes depending on your layer height.\r\n\r\nUpdate after printing:\r\nPutting the belt through the undercarriage arm hole doesn't work.  The belt rubs against the rods too much as there isn't enough clearance.  For now, I just used the two block from my Sell's carriage to pinch the belt and screwed that into one of the available holes in this openx carriage.  It works quite well.\r\n\r\nUpdate again:\r\nHuzzah!  jkeegan made the arm in OpenSCAD\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17971"
