    okh:function """Wanting to put my bearings from the original Mendel to good use instead of bushings, I modified the original Aleph Objects X-end clamp to hold a similar bearing configuration as the original Mendel.  I have removed the motor mount as I still have a vertically mounted x-axis motor and don't wish to change to horizontally mounted motors just yet.\r
\r
I also added a mounting place for end stop flags or opto-end stop sensors.  These are not at all close to the original Mendel's positioning, but you should be able to bend your flags into place.\r
\r
Version 1:\r
 *  Created a reusable "top" file so different motor and rod mounts can be interchanged without copying 80% of the scad code.\r
 *  Added 624 bearing mount in "x-end-bearings" file.\r
 *  Added m4x30 flag mount to bottom "x-end-clamp" file.\r
\r
Version 2012-01-15\r
 *  Adjusted spacing of holes so there is 40 mm of spacing in between the smooth and threaded rods instead of 36.\r
 *  Removed one of the straight sideways bearing holes - one is enough\r
 *  Increased angle of angled bearings so the nuts don't collide (new angle is 135 degrees, I think)\r
 *  Reduced height above top holes to save plastic.\r
