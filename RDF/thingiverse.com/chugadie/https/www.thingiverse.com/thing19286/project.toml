function = "Hanging repurposed bottles for the window farm project can be challenging.  If your chain or rope or zip-ties are not perfectly 180 degrees apart, your bottle will hang crooked.\r\n\r\nThe bottle hammock is a 4th generation idea for hanging repurposed bottles.  The simple design helps ensure that your hanging string is 180 degrees apart.  The two ring system supports the bottom of the upside down bottle on the neck and balances anywhere in the middle."
