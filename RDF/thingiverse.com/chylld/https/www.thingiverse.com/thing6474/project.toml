function = "This is a heavily cleaned & modified version of artur83's Penrose Triangle, which was a great design however not printable.\r\n\r\nIt is now enlarged (longest dimension 99.97mm) and printable on almost any FDM printer without requiring support. Walls have been thickened at the bottom to ensure a secure footing and to minimise excess overhang angles.\r\n\r\nBest viewed with one eye closed - looking at it with 2 eyes almost ruins the illusion :)"
