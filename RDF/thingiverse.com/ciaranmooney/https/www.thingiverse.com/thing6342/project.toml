function = "A picture frame made from 4 mm MDF. Should fit a standard 4\" Ã— 6\" (102 Ã— 152 mm) photo. It has nice pleasant rounded corners.\r\n\r\nCan be customised as seen in the images with words or pictures, as seen in the thumbnail. The stands are designed so the whole thing is displayed at a pleasant angle. \r\n\r\nIt can be positioned in both portrait and landscape.\r\n\r\nThis is an improvement over the previous picture frame (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5118) I made. \r\n\r\nCan be redeemed for girlfriend brownie points.\r\n\r\nFuture Developments\r\n* Make it easy to replace photographs.\r\n* Make the fit of legs a little tighter, remove need for gluing."
