function: "This is a replacement for expensive clip-less pedal systems used on bicycles.  The commercial versions require a special shoe/pedal combination.  This item allows you to use any old shoe, and the existing pedal of your bike.  Your bike does not have to be modified in anyway.  Unfortunately one pair of old sneakers will have to become bike only shoes.\r\n\r\nThis is an easy way to double your power output when on a bike.  You will be able to apply force on your downward and upward stroke.  I've notice a big difference while using them.\r\n\r\nI've biked 30 miles using this system so far this season.  No wear and tear detected.  I'll update this later when I've put more miles on."
