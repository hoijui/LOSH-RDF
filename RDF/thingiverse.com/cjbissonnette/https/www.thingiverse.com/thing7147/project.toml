function = "I had a problem I liked:\r\n100% printable filament spool by abliss:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5766\r\n\r\nBut I thought that the hub was a bit over designed (3+ hour print).  But then I found:\r\nMakerbottable Simple spool system by randyy:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4337\r\n\r\nWhich provided two great hubs. So I created a way to use the hub of the second item with the arms of the first.\r\n\r\nBoth designs are great, and I want to thank both authors for doing all the real work.  I just bade some \"glue\" to combine the two."
