    okh:function """This is one more element that used a big "vitamin" (non printed part)in my reprap that i wanted to replace.\r
The squashed frog is the part that is underneath the Y axis platform, and to which the belt as well as the bushings/bearings rolling on the rails are attached.\r
\r
The initial version was cut manually from plexiglass, but due to my lack of good quality tools/workspace, while it worked , it certainly would not have won prizes for quality !\r
\r
So i decided to design a printable version, that had to :\r
*be mechanically resistant enough\r
*be relatively fast to print\r
*be made of more than one part since it needed to be as big if not bigger than the maximum print size\r
*have mounting point for the bushings as well as the belt clamps\r
\r
So this is the solution i came up with:\r
*it is made of 3 parts , two of which are identical\r
*it requires 4 nuts and bolts to be assembled\r
*the inner holes with roundings enable the parts to be strong yet not use too much plastic\r
*it is relatively fast to build and easy to assemble\r
*it works well !\r
\r
I have yet to test it with a heated build platform but i am not too worried, because if the printed bushings of people using a hbp don't melt, then there is no reason for this to melt :)\r
\r
Very important : it uses the great bolted pla bushings by Griffin Nicoll available here : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7157""" ;
