function: "This is one more element that used a big \"vitamin\" (non printed part)in my reprap that i wanted to replace.\r\nThe squashed frog is the part that is underneath the Y axis platform, and to which the belt as well as the bushings/bearings rolling on the rails are attached.\r\n\r\nThe initial version was cut manually from plexiglass, but due to my lack of good quality tools/workspace, while it worked , it certainly would not have won prizes for quality !\r\n\r\nSo i decided to design a printable version, that had to :\r\n*be mechanically resistant enough\r\n*be relatively fast to print\r\n*be made of more than one part since it needed to be as big if not bigger than the maximum print size\r\n*have mounting point for the bushings as well as the belt clamps\r\n\r\nSo this is the solution i came up with:\r\n*it is made of 3 parts , two of which are identical\r\n*it requires 4 nuts and bolts to be assembled\r\n*the inner holes with roundings enable the parts to be strong yet not use too much plastic\r\n*it is relatively fast to build and easy to assemble\r\n*it works well !\r\n\r\nI have yet to test it with a heated build platform but i am not too worried, because if the printed bushings of people using a hbp don't melt, then there is no reason for this to melt :)\r\n\r\nVery important : it uses the great bolted pla bushings by Griffin Nicoll available here : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7157"
