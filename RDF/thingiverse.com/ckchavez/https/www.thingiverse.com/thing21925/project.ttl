    okh:function """This is a replacement part for a Step-to-open 13 Gallon Tall Kitchen Trash Can. I bought it from Costco a couple years ago and the part that connects to the small oil-damper (it connects to a bracket and the lid mechanism which helps lift and lower the lid slowly) when you step on the foot pedal broke.\r
\r
Instead of throwing the whole trash can away, I took some measurements and created my first "thing" (using Autodesk Inventor) to replace the part and it worked perfectly!\r
\r
I dissassembled the area on the trashcan where it goes and replaced it with my new and improved part. Of course I made it a bit stronger around the edges where the original one broke.\r
\r
So since my trashcan lid works again, I throw all kinds of things away and just design and print a new one!""" ;
