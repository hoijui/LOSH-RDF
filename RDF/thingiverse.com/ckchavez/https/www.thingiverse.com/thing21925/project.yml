function: "This is a replacement part for a Step-to-open 13 Gallon Tall Kitchen Trash Can. I bought it from Costco a couple years ago and the part that connects to the small oil-damper (it connects to a bracket and the lid mechanism which helps lift and lower the lid slowly) when you step on the foot pedal broke.\r\n\r\nInstead of throwing the whole trash can away, I took some measurements and created my first \"thing\" (using Autodesk Inventor) to replace the part and it worked perfectly!\r\n\r\nI dissassembled the area on the trashcan where it goes and replaced it with my new and improved part. Of course I made it a bit stronger around the edges where the original one broke.\r\n\r\nSo since my trashcan lid works again, I throw all kinds of things away and just design and print a new one!"
