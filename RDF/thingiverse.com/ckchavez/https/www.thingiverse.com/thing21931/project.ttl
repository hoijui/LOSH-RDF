\r
I thought tlalexander's design was great, so I used it for reference. I dont have solidworks, but designed this one in Autodesk Inventor.\r
It has a t-handle and hole in the T-handle to hang from a peg board on a nail. The T-handle was a request from my Dad to make it easy to dangle. The Center Prong is slightly longer to help dig just a little more of a trench.\r
\r
My 9-year old first saw this and thought it was a small back scratcher for him. I guess you could also use it for that, but it might not reach very far. I guess his request is on my list now.\r
\r
As intended, it has worked perfectly for a small garden area.\r
\r
Autodesk Inventor source file is also attached.""" ;
