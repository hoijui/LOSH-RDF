function: "This is a small hand rake that my Dad wanted for his small strawberry garden. He had one that was just too big for the area he had planted.\r\n\r\nI thought tlalexander's design was great, so I used it for reference. I dont have solidworks, but designed this one in Autodesk Inventor.\r\nIt has a t-handle and hole in the T-handle to hang from a peg board on a nail. The T-handle was a request from my Dad to make it easy to dangle. The Center Prong is slightly longer to help dig just a little more of a trench.\r\n\r\nMy 9-year old first saw this and thought it was a small back scratcher for him. I guess you could also use it for that, but it might not reach very far. I guess his request is on my list now.\r\n\r\nAs intended, it has worked perfectly for a small garden area.\r\n\r\nAutodesk Inventor source file is also attached."
