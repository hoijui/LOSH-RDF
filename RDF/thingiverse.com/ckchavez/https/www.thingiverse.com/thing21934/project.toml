function = "Just a simple Book Mark/Page Marker. The top portion has a space blank for a Name. I made another version of this with a Name at the Top.   \n\nThe Name on my original version was Embossed. I removed it so you can customerize it.  \n\nThe Words Book Mark are holed all the way through that add a nice visual touch just in case you forgot what this was sitting in your book for!  \n\nNote: The Thin .stl bookmark file is 1.5mm thick and the original .stl file is 3mm thick. Inventor source file also included so that you can make changes."
