The Name on my original version was Embossed. I removed it so you can customerize it.  

The Words Book Mark are holed all the way through that add a nice visual touch just in case you forgot what this was sitting in your book for!  

Note: The Thin .stl bookmark file is 1.5mm thick and the original .stl file is 3mm thick. Inventor source file also included so that you can make changes.""" ;
