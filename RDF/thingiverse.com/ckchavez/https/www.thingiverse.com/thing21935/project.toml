function = "Another Easy to use Coin Opener - with a Handle. My buddy wanted one but wasn't going to keep it on a key ring.  \n\nSo I added a length of handle that gives it a bit of leverage for those pesky bottles.  \n\nJust insert your Penny when the print is completed. Squeeze hard using pliers until it stops. The internal crevice for the penny makes it stick out the right length to open the bottle cap. (\"channellock\" type pliers seem to work the best.)  \n\nAutodesk Inventor Source is attached."
