function: "With Mothers Day coming up, the kids had to let her know with a Design and Print from the family Makerbot!\r\n\r\nIt stands to the side nicely on the bottom of the heart and either \"M\". We'll probably make a small base to hold it straight just to see how it looks.\r\n\r\nHopefully, Mom will enjoy it as it is too!\r\n\r\nI think we will put it together with a few of tc_fea's things: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8142  and  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5883\r\n\r\nTo all the Moms in the world. Happy Mothers Day!"
