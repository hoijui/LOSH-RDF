function = "My son first drew something he wanted printed on paper...it was a sword. He then helped me draw it in Inventor and then we decided we would make it into Finn's Adventure Time sword.\r\n\r\nWe used a 10mm Rhinestone for the Gem and believe it or not it does have magical powers! When we were finished, it made him smile and say \"That is the best thing we've made on our 3D Printer ever!\"\r\n\r\nWe painted it using acryllic paints - Silver for the blade, Gold for the guard & handle end, and brown for the handle.\r\n\r\nSo now it's Time to go on an Adventure!"
