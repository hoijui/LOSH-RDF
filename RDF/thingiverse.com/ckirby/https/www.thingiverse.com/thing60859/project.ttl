    okh:function """This thing is a trombone mouthpiece with boatloads of parameters. It can be customized in customizer. You should be able to reasonably approximate more or less any rotationally symmetric mouthpiece out there.  

I mostly use my printed mouthpieces for warming up in the car on my way to rehearsal. On the bass trombone, I find that printed mouthpieces are extremely warm sounding, almost Euphonium-like.  

The default parameters will give you something vaguely resembling a 4G size mouthpiece.  

Updated: 2013-03-30 with a new set of parameters for improved cup geometry based on an analysis of several commercial mouthpiece curves.  

Updated: 2013-04-13 with improvements to the outside geometry and a couple simplifications to try (unsuccessfully) to make it work with customizer. OpenSCAD reports that the file compiles to a valid, simple 3D object, but customizer is unable to generate an STL file.  

However, you can always download the scad file and edit it with OpenSCAD.""" ;
