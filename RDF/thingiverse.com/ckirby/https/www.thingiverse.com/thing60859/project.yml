function: "This thing is a trombone mouthpiece with boatloads of parameters. It can be customized in customizer. You should be able to reasonably approximate more or less any rotationally symmetric mouthpiece out there.  \n\nI mostly use my printed mouthpieces for warming up in the car on my way to rehearsal. On the bass trombone, I find that printed mouthpieces are extremely warm sounding, almost Euphonium-like.  \n\nThe default parameters will give you something vaguely resembling a 4G size mouthpiece.  \n\nUpdated: 2013-03-30 with a new set of parameters for improved cup geometry based on an analysis of several commercial mouthpiece curves.  \n\nUpdated: 2013-04-13 with improvements to the outside geometry and a couple simplifications to try (unsuccessfully) to make it work with customizer. OpenSCAD reports that the file compiles to a valid, simple 3D object, but customizer is unable to generate an STL file.  \n\nHowever, you can always download the scad file and edit it with OpenSCAD."
