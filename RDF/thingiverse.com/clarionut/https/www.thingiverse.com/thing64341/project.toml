function = "This is a slight modification to the brackets for Snille's excellent Panelolu case, for use with a steel-framed printer.  It adds small lugs to the bottom of the feet, with holes for 6mm diameter x 3mm rare-earth magnets. This is enough to hold the Panelolu quite securely on the steel case of a Solidoodle."
