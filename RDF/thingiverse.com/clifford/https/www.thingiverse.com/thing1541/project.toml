We use the script for all types of cases here at metalab. The example file attached is the case of our electronic door lock system.\r\n\r\nThe script can be found here:\r\nhttp://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2009/boxgen/\r\n\r\nYou might need to install SPL (the scripting language I've used for the script) before you can use the script:\r\nhttp://www.clifford.at/spl/"
