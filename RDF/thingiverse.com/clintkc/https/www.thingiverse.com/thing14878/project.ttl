\r
I printed this in the same scale as presented here, and did so with full support enabled.  I also printed it without the base structure you see here in these files.  I also printed it with no rafting, since I was doing full interior & exterior support.  It turned out OK, but took awhile to clean up even with a new Xacto knife blade (and I'm pretty crafty when it comes to using my hands).""" ;
