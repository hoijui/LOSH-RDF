function: "This is a pretty quick & simple variation of Emmett's original design.  \r\n\r\nIt's simply his original body geometry with a few holes added to conserve plastic & help minimize warping.  Nothing all that fancy... but does look pretty neat and does help with warping.\r\n\r\nThanks to Emmett for his excellent design!  Everything worked great!"
