function: "This is the exact opposite of my \"Cube in Sphere\" design (Thing #14878), with a twist.  Instead of printing the ball, I designed the open-sided cube to fit around an existing ball that I have had lying around for awhile.\r\n\r\nI also just noticed that this design is very similar to Things # 8846 (\"3D Sphere in Cube\") and #5181 (\"Block with Ball\")... not to sound anything like Dr. Seuss, of course.  :)\r\n\r\nIt took me 5 prints to accomplish this, mostly because I'm a single father and had 2 children running around the house while printing the first 4.  I've gotten used to not monitoring my prints, and failed to check on the first 4 prints before it was too late to \"drop the ball\".\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen a cube roll before?  My print does just that... and my 7-year-old boy is fascinated by it.\r\n\r\nTry it!"
