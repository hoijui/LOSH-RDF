function: "How do you make a great idea like Makerbot-printable (clothing) buttons better?\r\n\r\nWhy, make them Lego Compatible!  Naturally.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2009/10/04:   In the design files, the knobs are 5mm in diameter.  I remeasured my source Lego disc after getting back some Shapeways test prints and the Lego knobs are actually closer to 4.8mm in diameter.  I lucked out with my MakerBot-printed buttons; shrinkage brought them down to about 4.9mm in diameter.  The Shapeways printed versions are more accurate, 5.00mm diameter, +/- 0.05mm.  There's enough give in the plastic materials for them to still fit 'regulation size' lego blocks, but the metal one was simply too wide a diameter.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2009/11/07: I've been playing around with OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/) and came up with the attached DiscButton_20091107 variation.  I even added bottom \"sockets\" to this variation.  It's almost too easy when it's all code!\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: LEGO is a trademark of the LEGO Group and these explorations are in no way associated with LEGO Group.  Heck!  The files are CC-licensed; nothing to stop them embracing and extending it themselves if they so chose! ;-)"
