function = "As we were wandering around the Royal Ontario Museum, I spied this scrawny little critter and thought to myself, \"I must take a bunch of photos of this scrawny little critter.\"\r\n\r\nSo I did.  That bunch of photos is at:\r\n http://www.flickr.com/photos/aplumb/sets/72157627212309301/\r\n\r\nThen I bundled them up and passed them thru http://my3dscanner.com/ to generate the attached colour 3D point cloud.  The only filtering I did was remove some fragments of other skeletons that were picked up in the process."
