function: "This bracket is intended to be a printable replacement for the laser-cut brackets used for the threaded z-axis rods.\r\n\r\nThe side-mount bolts pass through captive nuts to lock the bearing (608-style skate bearing) in place, removing the need for precisely aligning the nuts holding the bearing in vertical position on the threaded z-axis rods.  It also may allow for easier removal of the z-axis rods themselves when combined with the revised U-shaped z-platform Small Makerbot Parts (thing:926).\r\n\r\nNote 1:  My test ABS print is quite tight around the bearing so the inner radius may need to be increased by 0.1mm or so.\r\n\r\nNote 2:  The 20090928 variant increases the inner radius surrounding the bearing by 0.5mm. A 1mm ring has been added to the top to strengthen the tear-drop, side-mount bolt holes. \r\n\r\nNote 3: Download the LaserCut variant if all you have is a laser cutter.\r\n\r\nParts of the Cupcake design were used to design this part so License is inherited GNU GPL."
