    okh:function """I designed this section of Toy Train Track for MakerBot printing.  It's compatible with the Thomas, Ikea and Brio brand wood toy train tracks.\r
\r
For larger objects, getting raft and lower layers to stay stuck can be a challenge.  Earlier simple copies had serious warpage issues, so I changed to a lattice structure.  This gives the lower layers a chance to flex and cool independent upper geometry.  There was still some separation of the raft from the build platform, but it was minor compared to previous iterations.\r
\r
The main track portion of the fabject is 54mm long and 40mm wide. Total length is 72mm.\r
\r
Note: The socket-side tends to be a bit tight with some track; you may need to widen the hole for a looser fit.""" ;
