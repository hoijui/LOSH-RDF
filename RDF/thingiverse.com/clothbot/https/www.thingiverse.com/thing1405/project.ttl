    okh:function """Getting some designs laser cut and wondering what to do with the unused space?  Why not fill it with something fun like Lego-compatible blocks?\r
\r
Note: I have not confirmed these work.  I just wanted to fill up some space on a heated build platform design I\\'m hoping to send off to Ponoko shortly.\r
\r
Update 2009/12/11: I uploaded the QCAD DXF (LCBlockFiller.20091210.dxf) and source SVG (LCBlockFiller.20091210.inkscape.svg) I sent off to Ponoko to figure out the service and exercise my QCAD+Inkscape design flow.  QCAD calculates the total length of the "CuttingLines_0p003mm" layer geometry as 10931.7mm (~430.4").  Note: I created this file by laying down 8mm-spaced grid lines and placing peg outlines at the center of each so I wouldn't get double-counting of internal lines.\r
\r
Update 2010/01/04: Test print from Ponoko arrived! I need to take some measurements and tweak designs to better accommodate the laser's kerf.\r
