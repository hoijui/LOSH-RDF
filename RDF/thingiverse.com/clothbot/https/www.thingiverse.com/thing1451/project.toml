function = "Trying to design something in QCAD for Ponoko fabrication?  Here's the flow I've used to generate Ponoko-compatible SVG files.\r\n\r\nCreated for use with QCAD.\r\n- Tested on Mac OS X\r\n- Should work in Linux as-is.\r\n- Probably need to install Cygwin on Windows to use \"sed\"\r\n- May be adaptable for other 2D CAD tools.\r\n\r\nI've chosen the Public Domain license so no one has to do silly things like credit me every single time they use the DXF files because it's a \"derivative work\".  You're welcome to do so, but it's not expected.\r\n\r\nAside: I wrote this a while ago but forgot to publish it.  Better late than never!"
