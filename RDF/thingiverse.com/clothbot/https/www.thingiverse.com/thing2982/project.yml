function: "This is a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2967\r\n\r\nI saved the SVG out of InkScape as DXF and cleaned it up in QCad so it would extrude cleanly in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nThe STL is just the pattern scaled down by a factor of 10 (now 2mm trace width) and subtracted from a 10mm*20mm slab.\r\n\r\nThe license was CC-By-NC-SA.\r\n\r\nAside: I'll drop the license to CC-By-SA if the source decides at some point to do the same.  I try to restrict my own \"NC\" license usage to finished designs, not building blocks.  Much more infectious that way. ;-)\r\n\r\nThe license is now is now inherited CC-By-SA!\r\n\r\nAside 2:  License updated to reflect CafeT's change.  Let the infections begin!"
