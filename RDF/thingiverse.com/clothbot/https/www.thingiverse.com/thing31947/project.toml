function = "This spool holder uses a section of 5/8\" copper pipe cut to length, capped with an insert to lock the spool in place.\r\n\r\nThe default STL is sized to fit the smaller spools that Voxel Factory (a relatively local to me, Montreal-based source for plastic) uses.  The smaller of the spools they use has a 30mm inner hole diameter."
