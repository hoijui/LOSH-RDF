function: "This is a work-in-progress (not fabricated/prototyped yet), exploring how to design a CNC/laser cuttable extruder head assembly for Makerbot/CandyFab applications.\r\n\r\n- Target material is 0.9mm thick steel/aluminum as provided by http://www.ponoko.com/\r\n- Routed channels are 1mm or 2mm wide\r\n- Bolt-holes are 2mm in diameter.\r\n\r\n- The pieces are to bolt together, then heater wire wrapped around the indented sides.\r\n- Material is fed from the top; air from the side ports.\r\n- If a magnetic material like steel is chosen for the Upper Plate, air feeds could be magnetically attached.\r\n\r\n- Total design height is 70mm to allow for three stages of heater-wire wrap for graduated heating temperatures.\r\n- Removing one or two of the stages would shorten the height by 16mm or 32mm respectively.\r\n\r\n- License set to Attribution - Share Alike - Creative Commons.  Feel free to adapt and make money off it as long as you share your mods!"
