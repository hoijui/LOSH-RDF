function: "Once upon a time, the original clips that held a faceplate to the cabinet in our bathroom broke.  I'd tried designing and printing off a replacement back in my early MakerBot Cupcake days, but it didn't quite work out.\r\n\r\nI finally got around to redesigning it in OpenSCAD, printing off a pair and re-installing that faceplate.\r\n\r\nSource files can be found at GitHub:\r\n https://github.com/clothbot/makerbot/tree/master/fabjects/Household/FaceplateClip"
