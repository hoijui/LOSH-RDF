function = "My first attempt at taking a set of photos and sending them thru http://my3dscanner.com to generate a point cloud.\r\n\r\nI removed the windshield for scanning.\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n- the reflections off the semi-glossy black surface show up as \"deep\" points right under the land speeder.\r\n  - lesson: matte surfaces are better\r\n- shadows make for empty zones, particularly under the rear jets.\r\n  - lesson: lighting matters\r\n- closeup photos don't help\r\n  - lesson: take more photos at a distance instead of up close.\r\n\r\n...much of which is captured in the http://www.my3dscanner.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=5:general-scanning-guide&Itemid=59 - General Scanning Guide, it's just interesting to see how not following those tips affects the final result."
