function: "I was looking for a simple single part replacement for the proprietary and difficult to use MakerBot spool holders, and came across whpthomas's excellent design - except it was slightly too long for the space I have behind my MakerBot, and I don't need it for 5lb spools, just for 1Kg/1.5Kg spools from MakerBot and non MakerBot suppliers.\r\n\r\nNot having Shark FX (~$1.7K!) I loaded the .stl into Blender ($0) and shortened the spool length to 8cm while keeping the rest of this excellent design as is, using the mesh editing tools.\r\n\r\nI didn't do this to the flaps model - I did get some significant warping with ABS, but with Strong Hold Hairspray on a 110C Kapton tape bed, the print stayed attached to the end, and the warping doesn't effect its utility.\r\n\r\nIf you want to customise the model further, I recommend a logo or message on the 'back' of it, as this ends up being prime viewing real estate inside your maker bot.\r\n\r\nwhpthomas' design (and this deriviative) fitted fine on my Original Makerbot (1) (Dual)."
