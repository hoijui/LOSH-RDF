function = "Okay, so you own a camera and you want to take a steady video, a timelapse or a group photo, here's a quick 3D printable tripod!  \nAlso Daid has made a slick, really minimalistic 3D-printed Tripod.  Check it out here:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24253  \n\nUPDATED July 31, 2014  \nTechnically, this update has been sitting in my computer for some time now and a comment recently encouraged me to upload these files.  You'll find that this version is a bit cleaner from the last and has key features like \"leg stops\" which prevent the tripod legs from spreading out too far, causing the tripod to fail under the weight of your camera.  I also added the SolidWorks 2013 source files.  \n\nLet me know if you would like any other modifications, happy to try and make changes accordingly!  Happy printing and photographing (is that even a word?!? XD  )"
