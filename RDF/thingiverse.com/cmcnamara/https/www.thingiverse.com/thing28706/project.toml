function = "I was really digging the original shutter shades, but I was at a loss for a good way to assemble them. Wire kept falling out, and I didn't have screws small enough to use either. So I imported the model into sketchup and added nubs to the hinges and arms so that the arms will simply snap into the main body.\r\n\r\nI've included the original sketchup file in case anyone wants to derive from it, but be warned: it was created using an STL importer plugin, so it's quite a mess in there."
