function = "For Solidoodle 2 and presumably Solidoodle 3, this assembled item mounts on the existing spool opening and is intended to guide the filament through the opening without creating shaving dust that could clog the extruder.  It additionally has a cavity for placing a sponge inside and surrounding the filament to clean it of any dust on it's way through, ensuring clean filament only into the hot end."
