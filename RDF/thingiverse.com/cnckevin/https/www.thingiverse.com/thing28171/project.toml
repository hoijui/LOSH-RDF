function = "A new joint concept for linking panels together which lie in the same plane.\r\n\r\nThe squggly parts stretch ever so slightly like a spring to pull the panels together with a decent amount of force.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, itâ€™s laser cutter friendly.  This joint could make it easier to build up large objects off of a smaller machine or from pieces of scrap.\r\n\r\nThis could also be suitable for something like a room divider panel, adult scale construction set, or maybe even a trampoline(!)"
