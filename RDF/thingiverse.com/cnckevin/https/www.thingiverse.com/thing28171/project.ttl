    okh:function """A new joint concept for linking panels together which lie in the same plane.\r
\r
The squggly parts stretch ever so slightly like a spring to pull the panels together with a decent amount of force.\r
\r
As a bonus, itâ€™s laser cutter friendly.  This joint could make it easier to build up large objects off of a smaller machine or from pieces of scrap.\r
\r
This could also be suitable for something like a room divider panel, adult scale construction set, or maybe even a trampoline(!)""" ;
