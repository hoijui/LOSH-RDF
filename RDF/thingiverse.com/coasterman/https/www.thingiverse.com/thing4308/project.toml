function = "This is probably one of the most stressful prints for your Cupcake CNC or other 3D printer. It will take an EXTREMELY long time to print, something like hours. Scale it up for a reprap.\r\n\r\nThis is just an idea, not something I expect anyone to ACTUALLY print.\r\nIt'll take FOREVER to skeinforge and print, and probably suck up at least a pound of plastic.\r\n\r\nIf you do print this, you'll never need to check your filament to see if it is feeding again...\r\n\r\nWARINNG: Print at your own risk. I am NOT responsible for printers put out of service due to extruder faliure, unfed filament, crashing into something, or Z stage stalls at high Z levels."
