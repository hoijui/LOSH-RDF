function = "This is a simple klein bottle. It doesn't exactly go all the way around at the top but it still has the characteristics of an actual klein bottle. If you pour a liquid in the top and rotate the bottle, it will eventually end up in what appears to be the walls of the bottle.\r\n\r\nI guess this is the kind of Klein bottle you wold drink out of...\r\n\r\nThe angles are gentle on all 3D printers. No support material required!\r\n\r\nI haven't tried this yet, so feedback will be appreciated."
