function: "This is a simple holder for your pumpkin\\'s candle. Great for making jack-o-lanterns.\r\n\r\nAs always, the source file is uploaded, so you can download it and modify it to fit your candle. The current design fits most 5mm diameter candles with a snug fit. Make sure that the inner diameter is a little larger than the candle, though, or you\\'ll find yourself drilling it out and breaking it."
