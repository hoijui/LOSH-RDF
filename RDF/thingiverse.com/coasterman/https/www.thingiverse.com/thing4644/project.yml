function: This is a stepper extruder mount that I whipped up in Sketchup designed to mount a NEMA17 stepper motor on a Brutstruder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4036). This is currently untested, though it will theoretically fit. You'll probably want to go into Sketchup (or any other STL importing program) and make it thicker so that it doesn't break itself (though your extruder's hot end probably has something wrong with it if this happens).
