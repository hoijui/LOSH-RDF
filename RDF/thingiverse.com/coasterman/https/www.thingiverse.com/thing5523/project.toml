function = "I made a derivative that hangs off the side of the printer, since I don't have any spare holes to attach it to, and I was planning on moving it around on the printer other than just the endstop mounts. Instead of drilling holes in my makerbot, I just made one that snaps nicely onto the side. It works perfect, and is easily removable.\r\n \r\nI don't mind drilling holes in my 'bot (I have drilled quite a few actually), but I didn't exactly want to drill holes in it this time, since drilling holes each time may begin to ruin the physical appearance of it."
