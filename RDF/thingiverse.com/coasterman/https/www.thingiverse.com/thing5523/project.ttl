Instead of drilling holes in my makerbot, I just made one that snaps nicely onto the side. It works perfect, and is easily removable.\r
 \r
I don't mind drilling holes in my 'bot (I have drilled quite a few actually), but I didn't exactly want to drill holes in it this time, since drilling holes each time may begin to ruin the physical appearance of it.""" ;
