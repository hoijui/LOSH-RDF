But they are inspired by other users.\r\n\r\nThe 20mm box, thin wall, and 50mm tower are ideas from Spacexula's great calibration set http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2064, and the other ones are my ideas and not influenced by others. After Spacexula's calibration set, there is quite a derivative tree.\r\n\r\nHere are some combos I have found with my MK5 extruder:\r\n(In order of: Layer Height, Width/Thickness, Feedrate, Flowrate PWM)\r\n.36, 1.528, 34.1, 255\r\n.3, 1.789, 42, 255\r\n.2, 2.521, 35, 197 *This is still experimental, most prints I try with it fail :("
