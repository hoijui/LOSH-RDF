function: "I've taken all the calibration prints out there and condensed them into one place. I have here:\r\n\r\n.5mm thin wall\r\n20mm box\r\n20mm hollow box\r\n50mm tower\r\nperimeter width/t tester\r\nprecision block\r\noverhang test\r\noozebane test\r\nbridge test\r\n\r\nand more to come.\r\n\r\nAll designs are my original work and not taken from other users. But they are inspired by other users.\r\n\r\nThe 20mm box, thin wall, and 50mm tower are ideas from Spacexula's great calibration set http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2064, and the other ones are my ideas and not influenced by others. After Spacexula's calibration set, there is quite a derivative tree.\r\n\r\nHere are some combos I have found with my MK5 extruder:\r\n(In order of: Layer Height, Width/Thickness, Feedrate, Flowrate PWM)\r\n.36, 1.528, 34.1, 255\r\n.3, 1.789, 42, 255\r\n.2, 2.521, 35, 197 *This is still experimental, most prints I try with it fail :("
