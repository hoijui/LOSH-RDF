function: "Are you not in the mood for a full blown filament spindle? Do you just want a simple feeder? This is the perfect thing for you! This holds a 1lb filament coil nicely while allowing it to feed by itself.\r\n\r\nOnce set up, the plastic filament will naturally pull itself from the filament keepers while the rest is helt in. It is similar to just putting the coil next to the printer with no twist ties, but it holds the coild tidy so you don't have a messy coil."
