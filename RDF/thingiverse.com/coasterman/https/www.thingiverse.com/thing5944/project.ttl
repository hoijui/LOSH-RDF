I didn't take the time to color it, since I figured it'd just end up in whatever color plastic you feed in.\r
\r
Still in concept stage. It's cute on paper, but it will need work to become printable. It has some brutal overhangs that I'm trying to fix while still using only 3DTin. But I guess it would be a great test for support material and how well your printer deals with brutal overhangs.""" ;
