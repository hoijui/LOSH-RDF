I do not take credit for the MakerBot logo, I only take credit for making it 3DTin-style.\r\n\r\nIf this violates any copyrights (or you are not okay with this), let me know and I'll delete it. I do not want to get sued because I remade a copyrighted logo in 3DTin. I'm only 12 years old and I'm being cautious, since I don't need to get myself sued over a 3DTin drawing."
