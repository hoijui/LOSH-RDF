That's what ran through my mind as I rushed to recreate and upload the lost STL that I was going to upload today. It's a filament guide that attaches to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3791 or http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5523.\r
\r
It is based on http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3792, but I thought how the filament may move elsewhere at high Z-levels, so I mad one that completely surrounds the filament and the filament goes through the hole. It works *perfect*.\r
\r
INSPIRED BY (but not a derivative of) http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3792\r

Images coming soon!""" ;
