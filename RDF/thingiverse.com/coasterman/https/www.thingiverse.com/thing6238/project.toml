function = "I have a WiFi router sitting on the edge of the server/printer/other computer stuff rack, and it's sitting right next to the server ready to fall off at any time.\r\n\r\nSo I modelled this up and have yet to test it, but it should work. It prints in two parts that glue together. It has a lip on the edge. All I have to do is clip the finished and glued-together thing on the rack, and then I have a nice little holder."
