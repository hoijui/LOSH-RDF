function = "Parametric OpenSCAD Funnel\r\n\r\nThanks to MakerBlock's great tutorials http://blog.makerbot.com/?s=OpenSCAD+Basics, I am able to make things in OpenSCAD easily. I easily figured out the parametric stuff just by looking at some other OpenSCAD designs. Now I am making parametric designs.\r\n\r\nI was going to upload a funnel I made inspired by the Foo Funnel http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1234 designed to be bigger and carry more stuff through it, but then I thought, why not whip up a parametric funnel? So here it is.\r\n\r\nThe script naturally makes it in most printable format and centers it. I just turned it upside down for the picture."
