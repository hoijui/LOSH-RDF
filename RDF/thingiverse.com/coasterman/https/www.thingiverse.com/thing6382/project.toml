function = "Bridge Test Part by coasterman [created with 3DTin]\r\n\r\nI guess it came a little late... Mainly because I was on vacation with no access to the Internet.\r\n\r\n3DTin tends to generate parts with 90 degree overhangs... all the time. Now I am going to use that to my advantage and make a test part that uses these overhangs to test how well your printer bridges! It can also test the amount of stringing."
