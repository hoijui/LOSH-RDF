function: "I'm the kind to mess with W/T parameters, not feedrate or flowrate. I don't know why, maybe because I like the standard 30mm/s speed and can't break away from old-style sounds and printing. So I just mess with W/T until it's perfect... Until now. I'm sick of all them stupid calibration cubes. My mom is amused at the number of ubiquitous calibration cubes I have made.\r\n\r\nSo I made this program that takes values and spits out w/t values. It's windows only because it's written in C++. The source is packed inside the Zip folder.\r\n\r\nColor coded by category and to make it all colorful to remind you that Skeinforge is your friend. \r\n\r\nThe calculations are based off of the thing that this is a derivative of."
