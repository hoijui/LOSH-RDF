function = "A little script I made to help make the oiling process easier.\r\n\r\nIf there are any errors, please let me know. This is only tested for a Cupcake CNC, so I don't know what it's going to do on a Thing-O-Matic. Theoretically it will work on any machine with at least 55mm X travel and 50mm Y travel.\r\n\r\nThat last picture had to be taken with one hand holding the oil bottle, one hand holding the camera, and one foot ready to press the \"Take Picture\" button.\r\n\r\n*** UPDATE ***\r\nNow includes homing support for Thing-O-Matic! Note that it is not tested. I am not responsible for broken ToMs! File is: Oil Thing-O-Matic. This basically takes the Cupcake script and inserts homing. I pulled the homing directly from the ToM ABP start.txt file. Don't worry if the Z height is wrong, it really doesn't matter."
