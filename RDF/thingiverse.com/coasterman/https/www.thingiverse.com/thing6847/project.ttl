\r
If there are any errors, please let me know. This is only tested for a Cupcake CNC, so I don't know what it's going to do on a Thing-O-Matic. Theoretically it will work on any machine with at least 55mm X travel and 50mm Y travel.\r
\r
That last picture had to be taken with one hand holding the oil bottle, one hand holding the camera, and one foot ready to press the "Take Picture" button.\r
\r
*** UPDATE ***\r
Now includes homing support for Thing-O-Matic! Note that it is not tested. I am not responsible for broken ToMs! File is: Oil Thing-O-Matic. This basically takes the Cupcake script and inserts homing. I pulled the homing directly from the ToM ABP start.txt file. Don't worry if the Z height is wrong, it really doesn't matter.""" ;
