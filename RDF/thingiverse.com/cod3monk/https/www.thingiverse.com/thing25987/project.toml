function = "This box attaches to the left side of an Epilog Zing 6030 Lasercutter. It provides protection for the exhaust outlets, by tunneling the air to the front and back, as well as storage for documents, rulers and other things.\r\n\r\nIt only covers the rear half of the Lasercutter's left side. Watch out for the front box design, which will be much more sophisticated."
