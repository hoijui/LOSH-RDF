function = "Do you have a frameless glass shower door, and water gets under it and onto the bathroom floor? Never fear, Thingiverse Citizens - the printed Shower Drip Rail is here to save the day! Print this nice little thing in clear, PLA plastic, and simply slide it onto the bottom of your glass shower door. This version fits a 3/8\" glass shower door, but you can easily change the skp file to fit other thicknesses as well. No caulking needed, just slip it on and it will deflect the rain running down your shower door back into the shower basin."
