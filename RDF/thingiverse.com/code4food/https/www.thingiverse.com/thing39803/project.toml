function = "I have one of these models from a kit. However, it is wooden. I like playing with it, and since I have a Replicator, naturally the idea came to reproduce it in ABS plastic!\r\n\r\nThis really works. The pins will snap in, and they have plenty of room left over if you want to add other things to it. There are some non-plastic things to buy to operate it, however. Have fun!"
