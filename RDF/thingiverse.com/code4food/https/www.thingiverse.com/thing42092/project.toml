function = "This is a derivative of Achim's \"Clock4\". This simple clock consists of several printed parts now: a stand, an outer ring, the face, and the hands (hour and minute only at this time). The movement is an inexpensive, but wonderfully rugged clock movement (made in the USA!) that I bought at Hobby Lobby for $7 and some change. When I saw Achim's original design, I liked it, and decided to print it. I think it will be nice to design several faces for it, so that the clock could be used as a seasonal piece, or relevant to a specal time of year or event. I may be adding more faces and outer rings, so stay tuned!"
