function = "This is a parametric version of the great Burgalicious from MatthiasT. It is bigger (12cm) as the size of my hamburger bread. \r\n\r\nYou can choose the size of your hamburger (diameter and size in the parametric SCAD).\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no text, it is plain, so it will print faster and it is made of only 2 pieces without nut or bolt. (even the handle is not so good).\r\n\r\nThis is my first design (or redesign)!:)"
