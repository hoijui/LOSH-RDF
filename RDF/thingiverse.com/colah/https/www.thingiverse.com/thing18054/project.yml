function: "Examples of using ImplicitCAD's shell() operation which allows you to make an object a certain width from the boundary of your original object. Look at the *.escad source files to see exciting new features of ImplicitCAD's Extended OpenSCAD format.\r\n\r\nSee the README:\r\ngithub.com/colah/ImplicitCAD\r\n\r\nPS. People will be releived to hear that, since the last examples were posted, ImplicitCAD's extopenscad parser has gained support for OpenSCAD modules. And it supports recursive ones!"
