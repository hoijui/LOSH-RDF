function: "The real and imaginary components of the first few nomials on the complex unit circle. That is: Re(z\xE2\x81\xB0), Re(z\xC2\xB9), Re(z\xC2\xB2), Re(z\xC2\xB3)... Im(z\xC2\xB9)... Because of Taylor's theorem, these are deeply fundamental functions.\r\n\r\nThis is an example for surfcad, a surface oriented python cad library. The python code generates all the STLs. Only the real ones have been uploaded since you can just rotate them and get the complex ones where necessary.\r\n\r\nA blog post on surfcad can be found at https://christopherolah.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/surface-oriented-cad-math-telescopes/ . surfcad itself can be found at https://github.com/colah/surfcad but is just in its infancy and subject to substantial API changes. Thus, it has also been attached..."
