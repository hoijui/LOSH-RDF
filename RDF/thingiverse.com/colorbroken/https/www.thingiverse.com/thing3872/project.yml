function: "This was designed specifically for one of my photo customers who has a degenerative condition, Late Onset Taye-Sachs disease.  He experiences muscle fatigue and problems with grip and steadiness, so he uses a smaller point-and-shoot camera with a table-top tripod for a hand-grip.  \r\n\r\nThe problems are multi-fold.  One is that the tripod has to be removed every time he changes his batteries, or when he puts the camera away, and he disassembles the whole setup for storage and transport.  Two is that when he does this, it wears out the 1/4-20 tripod mount in the camera, which is plastic.\r\n\r\nInstead of ordering a steady supply of new tripod mounts, which would only solve one problem, we agreed on an offset platform so we could move the tripod mount towards the center of the lens axis, and allow the battery door to open and close with ease.  The two-fingered offset on one side allows a 1/4-20 bolt to lock down into the camera, with the intention of it no longer being removed regularly.  We agreed to modify the camera a little so it could support a second mount on the far side, so I disassembled and bored out the hole for the body panels.\r\n\r\nThe center hole supports a standard 1/4-20 nut to interface with whatever you connect the camera to.  This should prove much more reliable than any type of plastic could.\r\n\r\nDon stopped by the shop today and picked it up, and was very pleased with the results.  I'm posting it just because it's my first serious design project, and I'm pleased too.  We put a Joby Gorillapod quick-release plate on the bottom of it, locked up nice and tight, and set him up with a monopod with a Joby ballhead, and a Gorillapod SLR Zoom with the same.  Now he has one plate mounted full-time, and two methods to support it.  Testing will tell if it flies long-term, and we can just print another one!"
