    okh:function """Having no better description for the piece, I\\'ll give a breakdown: I work in a camera store (yeah camera store!) in Upstate New York.  Every other day I see things that need fixing, and I\\'m a half-decent repair man, but only half.  In this customer\\'s case, he has a Fuji camera model you can\\'t really get replacement parts for, and his battery door is broken, as well as the body where the door interfaces.  \r
\r
I don\\'t have high hopes that the Makerbot can build a new body core or battery door, but I figured I could at least build a sort of blockade to help keep the door closed, and keep this nice Scottish man out of the duct tape department, as he has been doing.\r
\r
The catch here is that I have to assume that the plastic is only so strong across a long spread like this, so I wondered if it could be printed with a core, something metal and easily available.  Being that I\\'m weird, I also picked something weird:  A nickel.\r
\r
That having been said, the nickel is non-removeable: I insert it in the middle of the print process.  This is tricky, at best, and makes a mess until I can figure out a better way to print on top of a nickel.\r
\r
There is a second file (v2) that doesn't include a nickel.  While I liked this printed version as well, I kinda like the nickel version better, cuz it's bizarre.""" ;
