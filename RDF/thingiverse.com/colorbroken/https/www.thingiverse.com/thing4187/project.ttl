\r
What's funny is that the original, and most logical variation to me was the one with the heart.  I don't know why, it just seemed right.  Since my boss looked at me like I had two heads, I made another one that's got a tiny little lens on it instead.\r
\r
It should go without saying that these are not functional cameras, just little trinkets.  Do not give to small children, they look delicious.""" ;
