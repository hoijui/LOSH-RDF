function: "I haven't got a clue where the inspiration came from, but it just seemed like it needed to be done.  Find attached two variations of a tiny camera... doodad.  Scale it, bake it, make a necklace, sky's the limit.\r\n\r\nWhat's funny is that the original, and most logical variation to me was the one with the heart.  I don't know why, it just seemed right.  Since my boss looked at me like I had two heads, I made another one that's got a tiny little lens on it instead.\r\n\r\nIt should go without saying that these are not functional cameras, just little trinkets.  Do not give to small children, they look delicious."
