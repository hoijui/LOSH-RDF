function: I'm embarrased to say I forgot to measure it before I installed it.  Tired of breaking my acrylic idlers, I had my father help me rig this up in his machine shop.  Yes, it's been done before, but it's SUCH a better solution.  I'll upload the measurements at a later point, like the next time I have to rebuild the head.  Which is hopefully never.
