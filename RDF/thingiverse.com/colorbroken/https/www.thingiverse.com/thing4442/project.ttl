I'm happy to report after a number of little issues ironed out, I\\'ve got a pretty usable part and a fairly clean print with a few minor nitpicks.  The catch with this part is that it stays so hot printing the stem, it warps a little, stays mooshy longer than it should, and kind of gobs up a little bit.\r
\r
One evening I sat here as it printed and I blow onto the the print as it layers up.  The most recent 3 layers stayed a little soft, but the problem was reduced exponentially.  So I thought, why can\\'t I make a tiny fan, kind of like the direction bothacker investigated ( http://bothacker.com/2010/06/22/keep-it-cool/ ).  Because RepG0018 doesn\\'t really utilize the COOL function with aplomb, I figured, fans are worth a shot, so I built one, but I directed the air to a finite point, since I don\\'t want to perturb the HBP or the nozzle temp as it prints.""" ;
