function = "One of my customers asked if I'd be willing to try and make a secondary quick release plate for his Vanguard branded tripod head.  I liked the challenge, so this is the design.  I haven't printed it yet, but will stomp one out tomorrow.  It has to be printed inverted as to respect the underbelly of the thing, which needs to be accurate so as to lock into place properly.  Sean can find his own solution for putting some grip on the sucker if he so desires."
