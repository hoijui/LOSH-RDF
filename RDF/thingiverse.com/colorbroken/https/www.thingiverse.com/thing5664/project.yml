function: "There aren't any designs, only photos.  I had a scanner that was... too old to be useful, sadly, which I got last year at Salvation Army for $5.  As an instructional lesson, I take things apart now and look at how they're designed, for organization, structure, efficiency, etc, so I can make better parts on the Makerbot.  \r\n\r\nFlatbed scanners have a few neat parts in them, like buttons, gears, pulleys, belts, ribbons, guide bars for Z-stage mods, and usually a cold-cathode tube for illumination, or in newer models, probably an LED light source.  So I saved the light in this one, recycled everything else, and figured I'd try to hook it up."
