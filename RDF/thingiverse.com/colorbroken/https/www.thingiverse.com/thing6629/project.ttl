    okh:function """Hey thingikids.  I had a customer come in to our shop last week with a special project, though he didn't know it.  He is a VASCULAR SURGEON and he has a tiny little ultrasound machine he takes with him everywhere, like a teddy bear.  He has used a special attachment, a bracket, with a modified Polaroid camera so he can take photos of his work via the ultrasound machine and prove to the insurance people he did what he did, and probably managed not to kill them in the process.\r
\r
You can't really get Polaroid film anymore, so he's sort of stuck.  He asked if there was a way we could set up a different kind of system for him.  Since Fuji Instax film and cameras don't let you focus so closely, and digital is kinda the wave of the future as well as compatible with those interwebs you hear about sometimes.\r
\r
My boss, wise sage man that he is, suggested using the existing bracket to fit a new camera model, a Canon Powershot SX130, to the ultrasound unit.  This seemed unwieldy to me, since the bracket would be about 9 inches longer than necessary, having supported the old Polaroid 600-type camera.  So, using measurements taken from the original, I went about replacing the 2mm aluminum bracket with a custom Makerbotted version that would suit a newer, smaller, fancier camera.""" ;
