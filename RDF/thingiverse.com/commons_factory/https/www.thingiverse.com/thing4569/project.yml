function: "mutant brush is a design for a node and bars spatial structure. The nodes are digitally fabricated using laser cutter, and 3 mm 810 x 600 mm mdf sheets. The bars are put together with broom sticks. \r\n\r\nIt can be used as an urban plug in to personalize, customize or appropriate urban space, but also in community or private patios, gardens, terraces, etc. \r\n\r\nThe project has been developed in a cooperative process by a team composed by Fran Fern\xC3\xA1ndez Gallardo, Sergio Fernando Garc\xC3\xADa de la Riva, Francisco Mart\xC3\xADn, Javier Santamar\xC3\xADa with tutors Areti Nikolopoulou and Jose Perez de Lama at \"The commons factory :: plug ins at santa ana\" workshop, taking place october 18-25th 2010 at Absolut Lab [Fab Lab], Madrid, Spain\r\n\r\nThe piece / construction system has been designed as site specific, but think it does have a very generic character.\r\n\r\nhttp://thecommonsfactory.worpress.com\r\nhttp://www.absolut-lab.com"
