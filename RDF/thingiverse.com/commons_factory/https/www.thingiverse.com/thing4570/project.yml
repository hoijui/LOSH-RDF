function: "anforme is a modular shading structure made out of laser cut 3mm mdf pieces, incorporating lighting devices and recycled plastic bottles for additional performance.\r\n\r\nIt can be used as an urban plug in to personalize, customize or appropriate urban space, but also in community or private patios, gardens, terraces, etc.\r\n\r\nThe project has been developed in a cooperative process by a team composed by Ver\xC3\xB3nica Carre\xC3\xB1o Naranjo, Gabriela Massa Ascui and Silvia S\xC3\xA1ez Iglesias with tutors Areti Nikolopoulou and Jose Perez de Lama at \"The commons factory :: plug ins at santa ana\" workshop, taking place october 18-25th 2010 at Absolut Lab [Fab Lab], Madrid, Spain\r\n\r\nThe piece / construction system has been designed as site specific, but we think it as well as a generic to be used in multiple circunstances"
