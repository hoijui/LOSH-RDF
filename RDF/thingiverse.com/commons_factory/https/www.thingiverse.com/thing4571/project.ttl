\r
It has been designed to be used as an urban plug in to personalize, customize or appropriate urban space. It could be used, as well, in many other circumstances. \r
\r
The project has been developed in a cooperative process by a team composed by Isabel GonzÃ¡lez, Lucas LÃ³pez and Javier Yela with tutors Areti Nikolopoulou and Jose Perez de Lama, and with the collaboration of Susana Velasco, at \\\\\\"The commons factory :: plug ins at santa ana\\\\\\" workshop, taking place october 18-25th 2010 at Absolut Lab [Fab Lab], Madrid, Spain""" ;
