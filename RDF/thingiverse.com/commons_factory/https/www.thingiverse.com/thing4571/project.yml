function: "Botte mote is based on a mechanism made out of digitally cut 3mm dmf and small size standard recycled plastic bottles. It can be used to generate collapsible objects. The files uploaded allow the construction of protable tables in various sizes and configurations.\r\n\r\nIt has been designed to be used as an urban plug in to personalize, customize or appropriate urban space. It could be used, as well, in many other circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe project has been developed in a cooperative process by a team composed by Isabel Gonz\xC3\xA1lez, Lucas L\xC3\xB3pez and Javier Yela with tutors Areti Nikolopoulou and Jose Perez de Lama, and with the collaboration of Susana Velasco, at \\\\\\\"The commons factory :: plug ins at santa ana\\\\\\\" workshop, taking place october 18-25th 2010 at Absolut Lab [Fab Lab], Madrid, Spain"
