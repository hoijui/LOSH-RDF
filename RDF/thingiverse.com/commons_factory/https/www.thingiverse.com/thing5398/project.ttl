    okh:function """This piece is a ring to be 3d printed [and to wear in your finger]. It has one of Robert Ammann's golden rhombohedra [ca. 1975]. These are very interesting regular polihedra, that have the property of packing space in aperiodic tessellations. They are related to Roger Penrose's rhombi, that tesselate 2d space aperiodically as well. Penrose's rhombi [or rhombuses] can be found in the golden rhombohedra [spatial] diagonals. The faces of Ammann's rhombohedra [of course all of them are the same being a regular polihedrum] are golden rhombi, i.e., their diagonals are in harmonic proportion [1/fi].\r

Even if this design is not related to our main line of work [tcf], i decided to upload it because the cf project is rather slow these days, and i thought this would be a nice design to share for the first day of the year!\r
\r
The interior diameter of the ring in this version is 20 mm. This means it will fit a woman with large hands or a man with small ones.\r
\r
Svq is the airport acronym for sevilla, spain, where i printed the ring, at the Digital Fabrication Laboratory of the School of Architecture [University of Seville].\r
