This is a piece of urban furniture, developed through a process of collaborative design using digital design and digital fabrication tools. The piece works as an urban bench. It can be used as well as a small stage. It is built in 12 mm plywood, using a simple contour/section technique. \r
\r
Dimensions: 2418 mm x 3180 mm x 642 mm\r
\r
It is in the way of being parametrized [with Grasshopper] so that it can be adapted to different situations and sites. The design was developed within the Fabbing CC project, that took place in Caceres [Spain].\r
\r
As it is one of our first tries with these object size the piece has to be considered a beta version. Improvements to be made include [1] the redesign of joints to make the press fit process smoother and more comfortable and [2] to include some kind of pieces in the joints that keep the sections in their position once they are there, and [3] a better design of the contact between the piece and the ground, that allows [a] for an easier assemblage process, [b] for easy adjustment to uneven ground, and [c] for protection from ground humidity affecting the plywood; [4] general dimensions can be improved too in order to have a more efficient use of the size of plywood sheets [especially concerning horizontal pieces. These piece was designed for a specific site and position that conditioned our dimensions, which were not very efficient.\r
