function: "I needed some Star Trek badges for a theme party, but I could only get my hands on 5/16\" magnets, so I modified the hole in the back. Nothing more. All credit goes to tmorris9.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34902\r\n\r\nAlso, I know that the difference between 3/8 and 5/16 is small, but the depth was also different, and I have OCD issues :)"
