function = "This is a bracket that positions a 40mm diameter cooling fan over the Pololu A4983 stepper drivers in the RAMPS (RepRap Arduino Mega Pololu Shield).\r\n\r\nThe fan used was a 40X40X20 12VDC FAN, RS Stock No. 544-0526 http://uk.rs-online.com/web/search/searchBrowseAction.html?method=searchProducts&searchTerm=544-0526&x=25&y=8\r\n\r\nThe fan is countersunk into the bracket and fixed in place by M3x30 socket screws.\r\n\r\nAdditional holes in the corners of the bracket line up with the mounting holes in the shield board. M3 stud, coated in PTFE tube (d3D4.5) to prevent any shorts, was used to position the bracket above the shield.\r\n\r\nThe fan can plug into the 12VIN and GND-IN pins just beneath D8 on the shield."
