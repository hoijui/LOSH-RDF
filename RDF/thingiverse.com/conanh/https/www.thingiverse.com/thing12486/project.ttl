1. if I printed them thin, they weren't very stable\r
2. if I printed them thick enough to be stable, it was really hard to remove the spools--we have lots of colors so switching is common.\r
3. the risers were a bit low, making changing the filament difficult if the z-stage was all of the way up.\r
\r
So, I modified his design (thanks for the source file, jag!) to add a stable base and raise it higher.  They work perfectly.""" ;
