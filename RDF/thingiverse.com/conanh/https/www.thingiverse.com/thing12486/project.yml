function: "I love, love, love our new filament management via cord reels and jag's spool riser design (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5792). However, I had three problems with his design:\r\n1. if I printed them thin, they weren't very stable\r\n2. if I printed them thick enough to be stable, it was really hard to remove the spools--we have lots of colors so switching is common.\r\n3. the risers were a bit low, making changing the filament difficult if the z-stage was all of the way up.\r\n\r\nSo, I modified his design (thanks for the source file, jag!) to add a stable base and raise it higher.  They work perfectly."
