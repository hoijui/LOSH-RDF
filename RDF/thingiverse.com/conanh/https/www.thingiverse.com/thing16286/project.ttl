\r
Originally, I tried to make one in Google Sketchup but the result was unprintable.  Then I made a close replica in OpenSCAD, but that didn't print well and didn't make any sounds.\r
\r
So, I decided to go after a design that accomplished the same thing (2-tones & pealess) but had a more printable form.  It took me 8 iterations, but I finally got it :)""" ;
