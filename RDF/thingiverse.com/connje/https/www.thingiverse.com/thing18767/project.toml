Then you need the AWESOME AlwaysON Wearable iPhone Accessory. \r\n\r\nHere are some ways the AlwaysON will change the way you use your iPhone. \r\n [#] The Head-Up Display (HUD) means you will never miss another advertisement from your free apps. \r\n [#] Simply pull the handle on your AlwaysON and Siri will answer all your chemistry questions. Siri MAY be able to answer other questions as well.\r\n [#] The AlwaysON is All Weather Certified. Go ahead and walk to the mailbox in the rain, you and your iPhone will be safe. \r\n\r\nHere is how it works. First you set your screen to NEVER EVER turn off. Then you securely dock your iPhone. Finally lift the AlwaysON and place it in your ear. The contact point is modeled after the ergonomically preferred ear buds that shipped with your iPhone. Now you are ready for some face time.\r\n\r\nPrint your AlwaysON today and \"keep an eye on it\"\r\n\r\nAct now, you can download and print the bonus comic cloud tags to bedazzle your AlwaysON.\r\n\r\nONE MORE THING...\r\nStarting in July, we will be offering the optional hamster* wheel recharging add-on.
