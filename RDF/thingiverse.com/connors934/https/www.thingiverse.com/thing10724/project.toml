function = "The knob on the washing machine broke. A long time ago. This part is the replacement so we don't have to use pliers to set it and turn it on. \r\n\r\nThe knob on the washing machine is on a 1/4\" 20 threaded rod.\r\n\r\nThe first version is without any testing, so expect it to change. Unless it works fine. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis one is the first that completely functioned. http://www.flickr.com/photos/connors934/6044067876/in/photostream It doesn't look all that great, because of poor print quality and a need for a more spiffy design, but it works. \r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 6 fits functionally, and has a pretty good look and feel. This design meets the design's criteria by working and having a good surface texture. It could be improved some more with an insert or texture on the sides, but those are extras, and maybe they'll get done. In the meantime, the knob is on the washing machine and we don't need to use pliers to wash clothes. \r\n\r\nDone.\r\n\r\nHere are the photos: \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/connors934/sets/72157627352237365/"
