function = "There are a few ear bud holder designs out there. This one is closely based on Brett Beauregard's business card ear bud holder http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/06/laser-cut-business-cards/. It is designed in Open Office, and will be the basis for a student project at http://pemtech.pbworks.com/ It is expected that students will make revisions to their original design, probably at least 5, before they get the design just right. \r\n\r\nHere are the photos of the models I made to get the design to work properly: http://www.flickr.com/photos/connors934/sets/72157627576859948/\r\n\r\nOnce they get the physical design layout right, they will be able to raster a picture or their name onto the holder."
