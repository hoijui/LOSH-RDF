Finding nothing on Thingiverse, I used this excellent model from the Sketchup Warehouse. \r\n\r\nThe original is an extremely complex model. I converted the groups into shapes, added a base, and scaled it way down to a printable size in Sketchup. In Replicator G, I scaled it some more, and generated the GCode for a Cupcake Makerbot with a heated build platform. \r\n\r\nThe towers have double walls, so are not filled with honeycombs."
