Having a model is definitely not the same as having the real WTC and its' people back again. \r
\r
On the 10th anniversary of September 11th, I wanted to print a copy of the World Trade Center. Finding nothing on Thingiverse, I used this excellent model from the Sketchup Warehouse. \r
\r
The original is an extremely complex model. I converted the groups into shapes, added a base, and scaled it way down to a printable size in Sketchup. In Replicator G, I scaled it some more, and generated the GCode for a Cupcake Makerbot with a heated build platform. \r
\r
The towers have double walls, so are not filled with honeycombs.""" ;
