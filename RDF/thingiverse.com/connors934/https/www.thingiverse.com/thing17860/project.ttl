I've used this project in my classroom for a while. Since I no longer have a woodshop in my class, I'm reworking it as a 3D printed design.  



Here are photos: http://www.flickr.com/photos/connors934/sets/72157629433089119/ The pictures show the process of iteratively developing the idea, and not all designs will be represented in these files.
