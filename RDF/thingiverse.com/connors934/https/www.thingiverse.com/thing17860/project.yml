function: "The Mendocino Motor is a solar powered, magnetically levitating electric motor.  \n\n\n\nI've used this project in my classroom for a while. Since I no longer have a woodshop in my class, I'm reworking it as a 3D printed design.  \n\n\n\nHere are photos: http://www.flickr.com/photos/connors934/sets/72157629433089119/ The pictures show the process of iteratively developing the idea, and not all designs will be represented in these files.  \n\n\n\n2-24-12-This zip file contains some developments. The most significant part added is the four way connector that fits inside the magnets, and also has three holes sized to fit a standard pencil.  \n\n\n\n3-6-12  \n\nConnectors4 and MirrorConnectors are the two 3D printed parts you'll need along with two standard pencils to make the base.   \n\nThe G code is for a Makerbot Cupcake with Heated Build Platform.  \n\n\n\n3-31-12  \n\nVideo: http://youtu.be/gR2-wXdhSDc"
