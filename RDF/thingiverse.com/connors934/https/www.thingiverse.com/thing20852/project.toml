This is the software we use to send vectors to the laser cutter. It might be something you can open with Inkscape. What we do is create the file in Open Office, adjust the sizes and arrangement of the parts, export it as a .jpg, then import it to Cut Studio to extract the cut lines. \r\n\r\nHere are the photos and videos: http://www.flickr.com/photos/connors934/sets/72157629764354507/"
