function: "This file will allow you to mount your G1 on a tripod. \r\nHere is the file on the Sketchup warehouse: http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=473a91f14fb3ebd1aea467247624cb11\r\n\r\nVersion 2 notes:\r\nVersion 2 is much shorter than version 1. The first one was just barely big enough to fit on the Makerbot build platform. I revised the design to have a taller back wall of the groove. The hole is smaller, and placed away from the groove to make the foundation below the groove shorter. This takes way less material than the first one."
