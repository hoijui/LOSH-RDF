    okh:function """This is the rotor block for the mendocino motor. The hole is 3/8" and is sized for a standard dowel. The magnets I've used have an interior dimension of 3/8". Wire is wrapped in the grooves, and solar cells are mounted on the flats. The way I have made the mendo motor in the past depended on a 1" balsa block with a similar shape. The grooves were put in with a router table and custom jig. The center hole was done with a drill press. I don't have access to those tools, so am developing this as a way of making the motor without use of the woodshop tools. \r
