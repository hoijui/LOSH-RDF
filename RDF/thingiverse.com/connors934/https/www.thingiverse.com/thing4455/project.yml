function: "This is the rotor block for the mendocino motor. The hole is 3/8\" and is sized for a standard dowel. The magnets I've used have an interior dimension of 3/8\". Wire is wrapped in the grooves, and solar cells are mounted on the flats. The way I have made the mendo motor in the past depended on a 1\" balsa block with a similar shape. The grooves were put in with a router table and custom jig. The center hole was done with a drill press. I don't have access to those tools, so am developing this as a way of making the motor without use of the woodshop tools. \r\n\r\nHere is an article on the Mendo Motor: http://fussingwithstuff.com/2008/06/mendocino-motor.html"
