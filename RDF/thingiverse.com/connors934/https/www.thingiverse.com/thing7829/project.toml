function = "Lugging a Makerbot around can be a bit tricky. It is possible to grab it in one hand around the top edge, but that doesn't leave much hand capacity for the other little bits like spools of filament, toolbox full o' gear, sample print collections and other stuff.\r\n\r\nSome people are using a Pelican case to carry their bots, but that seems a bit too big and furnituresque for my tastes. With the rigid case, you can definitely bring it on a plane or other formal transportation system, and it will be very protected. Mostly, I want to bring bots from the building to the car and to another building. It would need to be for carrying less than 200 feet and for less than 5 minutes of holding. A big fabric bag would be ideal for this, since it folds up pretty small in between relatively infrequent uses.\r\n\r\nBack at World Maker Faire 2010, there was a rumor about some really big bags being given out by one of the yarn suppliers. These mythical Makerbot sized bags were long gone by the time I got around to asking. Since then, I've been wanting a roomy canvas bag for my bot. Sometimes I travel with two, and they're definitely an armload.\r\n\r\nRecently, I came into a sewing machine, and after a bit of repair, have been showing my students how to use it. They've been doing some great projects, and I have been looking for a project of my own with the sewing machine. The Makerbot Carrying Bag seemed like a good way to build my skills at sewing while creating a functional Makerbot transport system. While designing and making this bag, I learned a bunch about how to do it, and what I might do differently on the next one. There were a few moments when I could have started it all over, but getting it done was more important than the pursuit of perfection. \r\n\r\nHere are the photos: \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/connors934/sets/72157626507111364/"
