\r
When he visited, he showed the process of making the file, and we generated a bit of G code and printed it up so he can show his students. The code was profiled for a plain vanilla Makerbot with MK4, no heated platform and abs material. \r
\r
As it printed, we were able to see some ways that the file could be redesigned for better printing.""" ;
