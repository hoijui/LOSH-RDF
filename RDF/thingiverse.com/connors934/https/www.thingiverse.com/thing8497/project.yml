function: "Mr. Lemee teaches technology and engineering at Pembroke Community Middle School. He uses the Spongebob design as a sample project for 7th and 8th graders to learn how to use Sketchup. \r\n\r\nWhen he visited, he showed the process of making the file, and we generated a bit of G code and printed it up so he can show his students. The code was profiled for a plain vanilla Makerbot with MK4, no heated platform and abs material. \r\n\r\nAs it printed, we were able to see some ways that the file could be redesigned for better printing."
