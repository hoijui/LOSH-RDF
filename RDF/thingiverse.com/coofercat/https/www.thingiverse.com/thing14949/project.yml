function: "This thing has moved to Youmagine: https://www.youmagine.com/designs/snowflake-shaped-icing-and-cookie-cutter  \n\nThis is a design I made to cut shapes into icing on our Christmas cake. It's about 100mm across, and will cut into thin icing - it might work for cookie dough, although I haven't tried.  \n\nI designed this in Sketchup, so have included the source file as well as the exported, and printable STL file."
