A 3D printed Christmas pudding tree decoration.  

A friend asked if I could make a Christmas tree decoration with my 3D printer, and this is what I came up with.  

I ended up making a dozen of these because so many people wanted one once they heard about it. We got some 65x65x65mm gift boxes and some tissue paper so we could make them into gifts.""" ;
