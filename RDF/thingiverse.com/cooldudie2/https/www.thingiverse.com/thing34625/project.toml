function = "stargate base- this base fits my homemade stargate. The final stargate comes out a decent size which is ideal for warhammer/ lego minifigs for a size reference. i  am in no way affilated with the stargate or any respective works this is a scratch built model and has nothing to do with the stargate franchise or its repective rights."
