function: "This is a 4 holed toothbrush holder and has one larger hole for toothpaste. All the other holders that are already on thingiverse had either too many toothbrush slots or no room for toothpaste, so I decided to create this from scratch.\r\n\r\nToothbrush.stl is what you see in the pictures\r\n\r\nToothbrush2 Fixed is an elongated version that I made quickly because I had a really long toothpaste tube."
