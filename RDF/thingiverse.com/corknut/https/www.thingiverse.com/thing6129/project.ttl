    okh:function """I made a thimble for Snaks.  She seems to like it.\r
\r
The design is very similar to my rounded shot-glass, but scaled to fit her finger exactly, and with a bunch of conical dimples punched into the surface. \r
\r
The dimples are a bit too small (they barely show up on the printed object), but we think the slightly rough printed surface will serve the same purpose that the dimples would anyhow (to keep the needle point from slipping).  I'd like to see a derivative or parametric way to add the dimples, as the were a pain to model. \r
\r
I printed it in two orientations to test fill on the up! printer.  Outside fill was definitely easier, but the surface wasn't nearly as good as with inside fill.  Inside fill required a good 30 minutes of toolwork to remove however.""" ;
