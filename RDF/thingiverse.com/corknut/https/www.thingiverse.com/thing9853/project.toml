function = "Converts rotation into reciprocating (linear back & forth) motion.\r\n\r\nFunctioning parameterized design, so you can make it as big as you want.\r\n\r\nI designed this as a motion study, and to see how well this would work on a 3d-printer.  It works surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nIt's currently designed to be hand-operated, but easily modifiable to be motor-driven.  Motor-driving it is on my short-list.\r\n\r\nIn the hand-driven configuration, it needs to be held together by hand as you turn it to get the correct motion.  \r\n\r\nI would be very happy to see your application for this!\r\n\r\nThe case could use some modifications (e.g. attachment points) depending on your application.\r\n\r\nI recommend a Frequency 3, Radius 1 inch, Height 1 inch as a working starting point.\r\n\r\nAnything below Frequency 3 will bind.  I've tried 1, 2, and 3.  If you modelled in some support tracks for Freq 1 or 2, it could work.\r\n\r\nAnything below about a 1:1 ratio (radius to amplitude) will bind at frequency 3 (I've gotten a 1:2 at frequency 1 almost working, adding extra support track may fix this if you want to try something small with longer travel)"
