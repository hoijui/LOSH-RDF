\r
Functioning parameterized design, so you can make it as big as you want.\r
\r
I designed this as a motion study, and to see how well this would work on a 3d-printer.  It works surprisingly well.\r
\r
It's currently designed to be hand-operated, but easily modifiable to be motor-driven.  Motor-driving it is on my short-list.\r
\r
In the hand-driven configuration, it needs to be held together by hand as you turn it to get the correct motion.  \r
\r
I would be very happy to see your application for this!\r
\r
The case could use some modifications (e.g. attachment points) depending on your application.\r
\r
I recommend a Frequency 3, Radius 1 inch, Height 1 inch as a working starting point.\r
\r
Anything below Frequency 3 will bind.  I've tried 1, 2, and 3.  If you modelled in some support tracks for Freq 1 or 2, it could work.\r
\r
Anything below about a 1:1 ratio (radius to amplitude) will bind at frequency 3 (I've gotten a 1:2 at frequency 1 almost working, adding extra support track may fix this if you want to try something small with longer travel)""" ;
