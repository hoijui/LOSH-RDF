function = "This is simply a scaled up version of the 20mm box from ReplicatorG's calibration example.  By printing at this scale, one can test for issues that might arise when doing both long term prints and large solid objects.\r\n\r\nI use this model to test for layer adhesion and overall shape distortion that result from the selected material, certain Skeinforge settings (like the infill density and pattern, the layer height), the temperature of the build plate, and the ambient temperature around the model as it prints."
