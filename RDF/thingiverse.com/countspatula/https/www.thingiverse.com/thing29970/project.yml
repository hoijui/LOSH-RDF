function: "I had a bunch of scrap 1/16\" ABS so made some clips to attach them to the sides so I can use my ToM outside at Maker Faire.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: clips worked great but I also realized that black panels were dumb since you couldn't see anything print very well.  So I also made 1/8\" clips for plexi."
