function = "This thing goes in place of the original wooden axle end of the ultimaker inside the body.\r\nIt can hold the 2x M3 nuts so it's a lot easier to fix the part (no more need to hold the nut with a twizzer or nut holder).\r\n\r\nThe hole in the center is also a little wider in order to limit friction on the bearing.\r\n\r\nWorks great in conjunction with thing 54075 for the outside."
