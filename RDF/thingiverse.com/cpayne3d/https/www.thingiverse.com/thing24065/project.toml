function = "**** Updated 08-03-2015 ****  \n\nUpdated the Scad file to produce rotated output for easier printing. The new Scad file has the suffix **rotated** to use the new file.  \n\n************************************  \n\nI designed this motor mount to be able to install an oversized PARK480 electric outrunner motor into one of my RC airplanes.   \n\n------  \n\nThis file is parametric and the mount is able to have all of its facets changed via the variables in the SCAD file.  \n\n\n\nThe default stick length is 90mm, width is 10mm and the mount plate diameter is 52 mm.  \n\n\n\nSCAD file has the ability to minimalize the motor mount plate with cut-outs around the perimeter of the mount plate.   \n\n-------  \n\nUse the precompiled STL files for quick printing. One STL file has a round mount plate and the other has a scalloped (cut-outs) mount plate."
