function: This is a interlooped 3D sphere thingy that I modelled up based on my company logo (www.cp-design.com.au). It was inspired from the amazing work of bathsheba (www.bathsheba.com) after I purchased one of her metatrino sculptures. I really want to print a big one (like 4-500mm in diameter) and turn it into a pendant light. I think it would look great illuminated.
