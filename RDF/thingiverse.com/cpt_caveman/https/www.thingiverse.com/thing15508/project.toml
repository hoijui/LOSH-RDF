function = "This hack and the code attached allows a user to control a fifth stepper with a Gen 3 motherboard.  If you have a second stepper driven extruder, this will allow you to do dual extrusion.  \r\n\r\nThe unused SCL and SDA pins are used for the fifth stepper.  \r\n\r\nMajor work in progress, tell me what is unclear and I will fix it."
