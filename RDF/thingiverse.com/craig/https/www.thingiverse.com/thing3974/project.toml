function = "This is a straw holder for an MQ-3 alcohol sensor.  The MQ-3 is used by the DrinkShield (http://www.gfxhax.com/drinkshield/).  The DrinkShield is an open source breathalyzer kit.  One thing that happens when people get drunk is they tend to put their lips on the MQ-3 sensor which is a bit hot.  This add-on allows you to blow into the sensor without having to worry plus has the additional benefit of holding an optional straw at the end.\r\n\r\nThis will work with any MQ-3 but you may have to adjust for different straw sizes."
