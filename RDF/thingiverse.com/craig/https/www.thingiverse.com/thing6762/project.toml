function = "This is a plug follower used for Lock re-pinning.  These typically run at least $2.50 per size and come in bags of $20-$40.  I decided to make my own.  This is the first version which is based on the ones you can buy.  I have some ideas in mind for improved designs but wanted to get some feedback first.\r\n\r\nYou can use the openscad file to pick your lock type.  Then, re-render and it should size itself correctly."
