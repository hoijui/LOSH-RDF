function = "This is a bike pedal adapter that provides a platform to make it easier to ride with street shoes. See link below for an example of a commercial version. This platform adapter was designed for Shimano MTB sport pedals but will probably work with other mountain or road bike pedals. \r\n\r\nI tested them out on a short ride and this quick design worked surprisingly well using PLA plastic. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_506911_-1_200545__202363"
