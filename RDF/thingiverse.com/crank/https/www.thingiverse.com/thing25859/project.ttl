    okh:function """Well, it is kinda of windy where I live and I have blankets that need to be air dried. I wanted a setup that would be easy to setup, take down, and wouldn't take much space. So, I designed a fully printable clothes line. The bodies/anchors are printed and the line is 3mm filament. \r
\r
You can also use it to hang other objects up to such as plants, etc... or hang stuff on columns easy where access is harder. I will also be using it to hang outdoor Christmas lights, between columns, this year over a large spans that the lights themselves could not span without sagging horribly.  \r
\r
Yes, I could have used rope with some knots. However, it would have not have been so easy to remove.... and not nearly as fun to do.""" ;
