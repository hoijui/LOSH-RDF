The plastic is NEVER extruded directly onto the monies.\r\n\r\nI decided to do this as a learning gag Christmas gift for my niece and nephew. I will tell them the material and the process used. Next, I will encourage them with some hints on how to best remove the monies.\r\n\r\nThis fits two US bills."
