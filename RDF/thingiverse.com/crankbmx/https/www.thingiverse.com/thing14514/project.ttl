    okh:function """i wanted something to put my printer in so i build it a flightcase\r
things i wanted:\r
- it had to look cool, so no square box\r
- it had to be able to print, both open and closed\r
- L shaped, so i could add a spool holder\r
- windows to see it print\r
- less than 1/2 sheet wood (flightcase wood is very expensive, and most vendors will sell you a 4ft by 4ft sheet)\r
\r
all in all, flightcases aren't cheap, and mine came out at 180â‚¬ with everything\r
there are 2 good flightcase suppliers (adam hall and penn) about 98% of all flightcases i see at my job are from one or the other\r
on this one i used adam hall material, so i'll provide you a part list from them""" ;
