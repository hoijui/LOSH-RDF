function: "i wanted something to put my printer in so i build it a flightcase\r\nthings i wanted:\r\n- it had to look cool, so no square box\r\n- it had to be able to print, both open and closed\r\n- L shaped, so i could add a spool holder\r\n- windows to see it print\r\n- less than 1/2 sheet wood (flightcase wood is very expensive, and most vendors will sell you a 4ft by 4ft sheet)\r\n\r\nall in all, flightcases aren't cheap, and mine came out at 180\xE2\u201A\xAC with everything\r\nthere are 2 good flightcase suppliers (adam hall and penn) about 98% of all flightcases i see at my job are from one or the other\r\non this one i used adam hall material, so i'll provide you a part list from them"
