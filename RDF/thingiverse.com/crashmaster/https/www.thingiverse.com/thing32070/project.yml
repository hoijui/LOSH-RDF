function: "The idea is to connect additional electronics to a power socket device that would turn it into a zigbee power meter. From then on we can communicate with the sockets and:\r\n\r\n >> Gather information about the current energy consumption  - once we have it  we can analyze, compare, learn from it and finally be more energy efficient\r\n\r\n >> Control \xE2\u20AC\u201C both the energy consumption and your workflow at home. Describe what you want to achieve in the Agilart Designer and control your home from a simple Dashboard you can access from all your gadgets\r\n\r\n>> learn how to SAVE more ENERGY\r\n\r\n** Designed together with Kris Kalinov as part of the Power Home team at Startup Weekend Sofia\r\n \r\n** Won Startup Weekend Sofia: http://sofia.startupweekend.org/2012/09/24/powerhome-wins/"
