function = "This part is to make a tapered funnel top for a bell siphon used in hydroponics/aquaponics.\r\n\r\nAccording to http://affnan-aquaponics.blogspot.com the funnel siphon top helps the siphon start at stop at different water flows better.\r\n\r\nInspiration came from the flower shaped spillway at Kechut Reservoir near Jermuk in Armenia.\r\n\r\nI am thinking that the flower shape increases the weir surface which may help prevent problems. That and it looks neat.\r\n\r\nParametric, you can set the number of 'petals' and size it to the pipe you are using for a stand pipe."
