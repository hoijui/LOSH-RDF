function: "A friend's daughter has a little toy sewing machine. She only has 2 spools for thread for it. So I borrowed one and measured it for a printable version so I can give her more thread color options.\r\n\r\nI was a bit surprised that there wasn't a thread spool here, but than I realized that thread came on spools so who would want to print one?"
