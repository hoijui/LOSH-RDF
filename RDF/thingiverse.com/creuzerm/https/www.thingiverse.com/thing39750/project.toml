function = "I'd printed Toilet hinge http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6971 and it lasted about 12 hours. Probably because my use of Toilet Hinge Shim http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29107 made the hole centers too far apart for the toilet and put undue stress on the slightly ill fitting hinge I'd printed.\r\n\r\nI'd adjusted my Hinge Shims to address this and created this parametric  model to better fit my toilet.\r\n\r\n**update** I've added some pin holes down half the length of the hinge to strengthen it at the neck."
