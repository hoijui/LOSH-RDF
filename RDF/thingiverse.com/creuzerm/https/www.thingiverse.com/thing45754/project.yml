function: "Have a large woodworking project and not enough pipe clamps to hold it together?\r\n\r\nSimple Ratchet straps can work. Here is a parametric corner bracket to make strap clamps work well.\r\n\r\nThis thing features a glue expansion area in the corner so you don't glue your clamp to your work. It can hook over your strap so it won't fall while you are positioning all of your parts and clamps. It can also be made for many of your common angles for more than just a 4 sided box!"
