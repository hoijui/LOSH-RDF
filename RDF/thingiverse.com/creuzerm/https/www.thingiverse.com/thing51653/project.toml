It amazes me how many of these shoes are lost yet the camera and tripod are not.\r\n\r\n A lot of these seem to have a 'key' so the plates are not interchangeable when they ought to be able to do so.\r\n\r\nThere is an easy-access nut recess at the bottom for attaching the shoe to the camera.\r\n\r\nThis should print as created without support."
