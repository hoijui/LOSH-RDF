function: "This is to take the output of a larger pond/aquarium/fountain pump and split the output into multiple smaller hoses.\r\n\r\nThe cool thing about this it tries to create a laminar flow using a series of small hexagon tubes (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:41703) before running the water through a very gradual transition to the hoses. In theory, this will reduce the flow losses caused by turbulent flow and sudden changes in pipe diameters.\r\n\r\nIn practice, I was able to get the same amount of flow as a singular 1/4 inch tube about 25 feet long while including 2 additional 10 foot tubes with much more flow through each.\r\n\r\nThe photos are stereoscopic, it appears that you need to click into them to view them correctly."
