function: "I have a cell phone with a bad USB charging jack. It's easier to drop in a powered battery blank than it is to fix the jack.\r\nI also have cameras that won't record while 'charging' so this will allow me to record and have them plugged in.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to use a Buck Converter to set the voltage at the 3.6v that most electronics uses now days."
