function = "This is a simple modification to GregFrost's excellent Prusa X-ends that removes the column for the upper nut trap.  I don't use top nuts, so printing the nut traps would have been a waste of plastic and time.\r\n\r\nThis was a direct modification to the STL file, so there is no openscad or solidworks \"source\" file.\r\n\r\nThe STL has already been run through netfabb, so it shouldn't produce any errors."
