\r
I have designed the first version (ghcookie.*) with the Custom-Cookie-Cutter-Generator by guru (thing:3433, how can I link to it?).\r
\r
Then I've improved the shape a bit, still using the same tool (v2, ghcookie2.*).\r
\r
Because I was still not completely satisfied with the result, I used some shell script to convert the CookieCutter custom format to an SVG path and used Inkscape + OpenSCAD to rework it and create v3, which prints much cleaner.\r
\r
Finally, after having made the first cookies, I wanted to make an even better v4, with an additional accessory to hold the cookie down while the cutter is lifted. This is now reality and I was really pleased with the result.\r
\r
I've left all the older files for your reference, but if you intend to print one I suggest you focus on v4.\r
\r
This work is in the public domain, there may or may not be some restrictions on the geohashing logo itself.""" ;
