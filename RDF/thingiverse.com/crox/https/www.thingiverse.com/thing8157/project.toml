function = "This is a simple enclosure that I designed for an Arduino Duemilanove (USB).\r\n\r\nThe \"top\" part slides into the bottom one. The one I printed has enough friction that I didn't need any glue to hold the two parts together, yet they can still be taken apart when needed.\r\n\r\nThere is a hole on the side opposite from the USB port through which you can put cables. There are also two holes in the top part that I used for a led and a push-button. Those can be easily commented out if not needed."
