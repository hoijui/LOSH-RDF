function = "This printed part can be used with the standardized parts listed to create the peristaltic pump head (fluid/paste printer) for the cubely printer. This allows printing with several fluids and pastes including solder paste, edibles like frosting, and perhaps most importantly liquid PVC (liquid sculpy, etc) . Liquid PVC can be used a a dissolvable support material when combined with a heated bed (it dissolves in lacquer thinner which does not effect ABS)."
