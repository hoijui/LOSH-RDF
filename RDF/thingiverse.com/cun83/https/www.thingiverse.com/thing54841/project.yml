function: "I needed the fan mounting holes to be a litte more sturdy, so I added two more option to the SCAD:\r\n-Define the outer diameter for the mounting holes -> More plastics, more strength\r\n-Make the bottom of the mounting holes square, to get rid of overhangs there\r\n\r\naaand added it to Customizer for fun :-)\r\n\r\nThanks go to iquizzle for his awesome fan mount system :-)\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39945"
