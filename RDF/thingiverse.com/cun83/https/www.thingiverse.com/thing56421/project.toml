function = "A 3 point headtracking device to be used with FreeTrack ( http://www.free-track.net/english/ ).  \n\nEDIT: Use FreeTrackNoIR, it's the successor of FreeTrack (even supports headtracking without an IR device!):  \nhttp://facetracknoir.sourceforge.net/home/default.htm  \n\nIncludes a battery compartment and a opening for a switch.  \n\n\n\nDesigned to be put on top of a headphone.   \n\nIf you have a Logitech G930 you can use my clip for the G930 to attach the device to your headphone:  \n\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47124 (use one with center guides). Or just use velcro tape, or design your own clip :-)  \n\n\n\nAdditional Parts:  \n\n-2x M3 screws  (10-15mm)  \n\n-4x M3 hex nut  \n\n-3xLEDs, some electronics, 2x AAA batteries  \n\n\n\nCredits:   \n\nThe battery holder is based on this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5079  \n\nThanks obijuan!"
