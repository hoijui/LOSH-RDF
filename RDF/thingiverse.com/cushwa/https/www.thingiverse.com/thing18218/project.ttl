Please consider tipping the creator (cushwa) if you have enjoyed this model. This will allow me to create more great models for Thingiverse and the 3d printing community.  I do this as a living and rely on people who enjoy my models to compensate me for the time and effort that I put into them to make them a good as possible.  5 dollar tip is not too much for a great print for you printer.  Please click on my name (cushwa) at the top of this page and click on "tip the designer" in my profile page.  Thanks so much.  - Cheers""" ;
