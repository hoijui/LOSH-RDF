function: "Owl statue... good for scaring away pigions and crows.\r\n\r\nPlease consider tipping the creator (cushwa) if you have enjoyed this model. This will allow me to create more great models for Thingiverse and the 3d printing community.  I do this as a living and rely on people who enjoy my models to compensate me for the time and effort that I put into them to make them a good as possible.  5 dollar tip is not too much for a great print for you printer.  Please click on my name (cushwa) at the top of this page and click on \"tip the designer\" in my profile page.  Thanks so much.  - Cheers"
