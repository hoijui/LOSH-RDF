function: "http://boingboing.net/2012/06/01/the-pirate-bay-gift-card.html\r\n\r\nI think I did the conversion properly to make these cards equally as valuable in each form of currency.  If anyone needs, I can exchange from one currency to another for a 25% processing fee.\r\n\r\nThis would've been up way earlier buy I was busy with the met hackathon Friday and Saturday, it was very nice out today,  and I didn't check boingboing until just now.  Sorry for the delay...  =)"
