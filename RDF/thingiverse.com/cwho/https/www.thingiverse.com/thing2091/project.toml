function = "This is an adapter that tips the palm pre touchstone up so that it is easier to see on a dashboard, high shelf etc. I made it for my car where it works really really well as a mount when combined with the touchstone.\r\nIt is easy to adjust the angle of the mount in a CAD program.  It would look good in black ABS.   I made it on our Z Corp machines at www.lgm3d.com  and painted it black."
