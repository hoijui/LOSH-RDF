function: "For the cosplayers out there, accent your sweet costume with a full sized kunai. Should go well with anything Naruto related. To get the size I wanted, I ended up splitting up the print into 4 parts first, but then realized the layering wasn't stable enough due to the vertical printing direction. so I switched it to an 8 piece print. Including holes to use bits of 3mm ABS to help join the pieces.  \nI've been debating whether or not to post this since I read the blog post about posting weapons. Would this be considered a weapon or another toy? What would you say?"
