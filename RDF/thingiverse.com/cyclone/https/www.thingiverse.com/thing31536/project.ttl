The two pieces of the coin put together, one version standing with a flat on the bottom. Works well with a raft, which if you left a bit in place after clean up, makes up for the flat. Printed fine at .075mm layer height.\r
\r
Model has the same detail thickness as the original.\r
\r
"2 Skull" version has the skull on both sides TwoFace style.\r
There is also a necklace version.""" ;
