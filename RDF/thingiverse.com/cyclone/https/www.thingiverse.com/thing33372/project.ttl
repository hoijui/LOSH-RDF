\r
Light your darkest hour! [Or longer with a newer battery ;-) ]\r
\r
If you don't have candles but you *do* have stuff for throwies here is a slightly better way to light the room.\r
\r
I also thought it would be useful for lighting decorations and projects. It is the same size diameter as a standard tea-light/votive so it will fit in most places you would use one of those. I find the off-the-shelf electric tea-lights aren't bright enough to do anything but this is quite nice. \r
\r
We've had a few of these lit for 3-4 hours a day for about a week now and they still seem pretty bright.""" ;
