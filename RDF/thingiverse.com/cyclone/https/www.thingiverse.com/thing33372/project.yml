function: "For my compatriots to the north that are in for a rough patch with the impending storm. \r\n\r\nLight your darkest hour! [Or longer with a newer battery ;-) ]\r\n\r\nIf you don't have candles but you *do* have stuff for throwies here is a slightly better way to light the room.\r\n\r\nI also thought it would be useful for lighting decorations and projects. It is the same size diameter as a standard tea-light/votive so it will fit in most places you would use one of those. I find the off-the-shelf electric tea-lights aren't bright enough to do anything but this is quite nice. \r\n\r\nWe've had a few of these lit for 3-4 hours a day for about a week now and they still seem pretty bright."
