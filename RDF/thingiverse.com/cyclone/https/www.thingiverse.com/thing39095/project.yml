function: Converted the Solidworks to see if it would be printable by a DIY printer. The size is 500x500 if you rotate it 45 degrees which won't fit on most DIY printers. Yet another reason for me to build a Large Format Printer. I thought it was an interesting shape so I decided to make it a derivative.
