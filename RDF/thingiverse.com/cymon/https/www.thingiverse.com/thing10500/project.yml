function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nzenix beat me to the punch with http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10039, but this set was designed to preserve the shape of traditional sets to allow for playing common variations like Banqi (dark/half chess). The icons were chosen to be easy for western players to learn.\r\n\r\nThe provided board is half a Chinese Chess board fitted to print on 8 1/2x11 paper. Print 2 and tape the together to play the full game or print one to play Banqi. (I play a lot of Banqi.)"
