So I began work on a set with more detail to make the pieces clearer. I make the pieces hexagonal and stood them on edge to get more detail.\r\n\r\nThis set was a pain to make, especially compared to the relative ease of making the previous set. This set is also difficult to paint. I have been unable to successfully do a painting yet. I think it could be done with a ink and a hypodermic needle, but I've decided that I'm just going to have to make another variation with snap-in pieces that can be printed in multiple colors. The other option is to just print the two sides in two different colors, but that excludes playing banqi (unacceptable to me).\r\n\r\nThe provided board is half a Chinese Chess board fitted to print on 8 1/2x11 paper. Print 2 and tape the together to play the full game or print one to play Banqi. (I play a lot of Banqi.)\r\n\r\nThank you again to kitlaan for the test print pictures."
