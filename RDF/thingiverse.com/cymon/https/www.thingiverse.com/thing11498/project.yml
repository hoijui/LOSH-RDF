function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nThis little guy loves to sit on your desk and help you make things. He's Maker the bot!\r\n\r\nMy entry for the Makerbot/GrabCAD robot mascot competition( http://grabcad.com/library/maker-bot ). Not just a cute robot but also a fully functional set of helping hands. Fun and functional! There are a few iterations of the head.\r\n\r\nThe hand/clips are modifications of J_Hodgie's clips ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5580 ) if you couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Changed the body/logo connectors based off the screw library and adjusted some tolerances on the joints. Be sure to download the V2 zips or stls."
