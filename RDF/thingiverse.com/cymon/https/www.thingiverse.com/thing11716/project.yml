function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nI wanted my Maker the bot to have normal arms, you know, for photo shoots and the like, so instead of reinventing the wheel I created a new shoulder joint that would be compatible with tbuser's Bobblehead Bot ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11190 ). I also organized this print into plates for easier printing.\r\n\r\nThis one also features the newest head designed for the contest. This one I think is a better mascot tho there is still some work to be done.\r\n\r\nMarked WIP until someone successfully prints one."
