This was made based on the look of a recorder and best guesses based on illustrations and went through several iterations to attempt a fix, but in the end has several mistakes that renders it... not as good. In other words it looks the part but it doesn't sound the part. Use http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12168 for one that works.\r
