function: "Warning: DO NOT PRINT THIS THING! As it is this does not play. This was made based on the look of a recorder and best guesses based on illustrations and went through several iterations to attempt a fix, but in the end has several mistakes that renders it... not as good. In other words it looks the part but it doesn't sound the part. Use http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12168 for one that works.\r\n\r\nIf you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays"
