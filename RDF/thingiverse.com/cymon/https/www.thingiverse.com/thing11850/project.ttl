With as many dice as there are on this site I'm surprised that this is the first attempt a making weighted dice. However, since I don't have a 3D printer (yet) I can't be sure it'll work so as a gag that I'm sure will work this is also the plans for a dice made with dual extruders. Haha!\r

Marked WIP until someone successfully prints one.""" ;
