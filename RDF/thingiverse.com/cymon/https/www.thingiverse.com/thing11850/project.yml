function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nWith as many dice as there are on this site I'm surprised that this is the first attempt a making weighted dice. However, since I don't have a 3D printer (yet) I can't be sure it'll work so as a gag that I'm sure will work this is also the plans for a dice made with dual extruders. Haha!\r\n\r\nMarked WIP until someone successfully prints one."
