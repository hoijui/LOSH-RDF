It finally works!  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9VdXtTlhCU  \r\n\r\nThis revision includes minor tweaks which necessitated breaking it into 4 parts.

In the hands of an experienced player it creates a sound synonymous with Renaissance music. Often used in elementary music classes because of it's ease of operation. With 3D printing everyone can have one of their own to make beautiful music on... or wailing screeches if they never got past \"hot crossed buns\"."
