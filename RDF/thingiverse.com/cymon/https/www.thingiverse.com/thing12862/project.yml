function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the overhang on tzzhc4's print ( http://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:15325 ) I realized how I could fix it. This is that fix. Then I saw Upgrayedd's print of V2.2 and realized how I could place the pieces better (with holes facing out)\r\n\r\nThe recorder is one of the oldest woodwind instruments. In the hands of an experienced player it creates a sound synonymous with Renaissance music. Often used in elementary music classes because of it's ease of operation. With 3D printing everyone can have one of their own to make beautiful music on... or wailing screeches if they never got past \"hot crossed buns\"."
