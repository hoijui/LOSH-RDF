You may want to print it instead:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12946\r\n\r\nTheoretically the windway of the recorder is the important part. The exterior could be shaped like anything you want. Even the Empire State Building (by Hoeken http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:625 )\r\n\r\nFor the New Museum Challenge:\r\nWhat is the design a derivative of? How does it improve on or challenge existing design conventions? How does it utilize the unique ability of 3D printing to personalize and improve on the world around us?\r\nAs if making music wasn't beautiful enough, now this recorder can sit on your shelf as an objet d'arte. 3D printing allows designs to go beyond functional to decorative."
