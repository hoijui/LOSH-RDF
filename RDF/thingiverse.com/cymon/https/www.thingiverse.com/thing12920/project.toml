function = "I saw a cool desk toy. It consisted of identical joints that alternated axis rotation that moved in interesting ways and made semi-geometric shapes or just chaos. So I decided to create it modifying the joints of the toy robot tool kit.\r\n\r\nVersion 1 kept here for historical purposes.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 consisted of turning the pieces 90 degrees so the knob wasn't printing straight up, but this meant shortening the hole. An optional plug was added to fatten it back up.\r\n\r\nVersion 3 More tweaking\r\n\r\nVersion 4 works. Use it."
