function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nTheoretically the windway of the recorder is the important part. The exterior could be shaped like anything you want. Even an original piece of art with a natural look.  \r\n\r\nUnlike the Empire State recorder the parts of this recorder are compatible with the RecorderV2.2 so you could build it from the previous in steps if you desire.  \r\n\r\nMusic is art and beautiful, but why can't your instrument be artistic when it's not making sounds? Another example of 3D printing allowing designs to go beyond functional to decorative.  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOEJNR1yRBA"
