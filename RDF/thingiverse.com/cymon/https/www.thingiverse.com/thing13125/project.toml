function = "Make your own artful as well as functional recorder instrument!\r\n\r\nThe source file to my recorder (available on V2.2) is kind of a mess when the important part, the wind way, is really all you're looking for if you want to make your own original creation based on it. So here is that negative space all in one file.\r\n\r\nInstead of one big complex shape to Boolean subtract out (which often ends badly) the STL included has many overlapping shapes. You will need to break them apart and boolean subtract them individually for best results (in my experience).\r\n\r\nNote, the lowest finger hole is not rotated to make reaching it with the pinky finger. Consider that in your design (Either pre-rotate like in v2.1b or make it adjustable as in v2.2)"
