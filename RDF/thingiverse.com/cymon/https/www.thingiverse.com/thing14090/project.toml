function = "Of all the sketches in the TEDxYouth@Flanders Project Shellter Workshop Sketches I immediately thought this one had the most potential to translate into 3D. Apparently I wasn't the only one. ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14046 for one.)\r\n\r\nI made some major design choices to make it (1) printable and (2) a good shell for the hermit crabs. (Check the wireframe to see the sweet ledge inside.) Unfortunately I'm still not 100% sure it'll print as-is. I hope someone prints it and gives me feedback."
