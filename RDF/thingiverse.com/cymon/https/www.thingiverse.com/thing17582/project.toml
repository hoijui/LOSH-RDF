Based on the Ring-A-Thing.\r\n\r\nAfter making this I found a picture of the decoder rings from radio shows in days of yore. This isn't exactly like that. It works, tho to decode and encode messages like the one below.\r\n\r\n2 5  19 21 18 5  20 15  4 18 9 14 11  25 15 21 18  15 22 1 12 20 9 14 5!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Added a facedown version of the letter disk without sloping inside and a blank version of the disk, also face down. It is left to the user to make a 2D printable letter disk to fill it with.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Added a png suitable for printing on paper and cutting out, possibly using http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17645 . What it is not is scaled so the outter ring is 37mm across. Helping any way I can."
