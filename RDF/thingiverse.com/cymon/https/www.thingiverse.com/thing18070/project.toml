I always thought cbiffle's chess set was the most complete and most printable on thingiverse, but I wanted the knight to be a little different. I noticed the blender files were included so I cracked them open and fixed the knight. Then I noticed some bad geometry on the knight and the others too, so I fixed them. Then I ran decimate on some of the higher poly counts pieces, just to finish up.\r\n\r\nSo in the end this is a lot of little changes to cbiffle's original excellent chess set."
