A monster that could fit in your pocket? What's in my pocket all the time? My hands!\r\n\r\nThis is a proof-of-concept for a modification of the ring-a-thing that turns your hand into a talking puppet. If someone prints this and it works out I can make other versions with mix-and-match noses and scalps, not to mention eyelids to add personality.\r\n\r\nThe default ring is size 13(US). Upon requset I can make a ring for any sized finger."
