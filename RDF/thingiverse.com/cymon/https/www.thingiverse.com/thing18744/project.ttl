In my opinion, MrJaws (and MrAllagator) represent the best thing about having makerbots in the world: That you can mave something functional with an artistic side. That blend of engineer and designer.\r
\r
However, MrJaws was, to me, a little TOO much artistry, speaking in terms of volume. So I decided to make a version that was just as much shark, but heavier on the jaw.\r
\r
Leave me a comment if you would like me to do the same with the alligator.""" ;
