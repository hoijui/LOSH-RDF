function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, MrJaws (and MrAllagator) represent the best thing about having makerbots in the world: That you can mave something functional with an artistic side. That blend of engineer and designer.\r\n\r\nHowever, MrJaws was, to me, a little TOO much artistry, speaking in terms of volume. So I decided to make a version that was just as much shark, but heavier on the jaw.\r\n\r\nLeave me a comment if you would like me to do the same with the alligator."
