function: "Ever wonder if your iPhone think's it's smarter than you are? Use this charging station and remove all doubt.\r\n\r\nWhile working on my trilogy of chargers, getting the measurements to work, I create a little test brick, something that'll print faster than a full throne. When I got it right I was left with a test brick (included) and I thought \"I could do something with this.\"\r\n\r\nThe iThrone http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18725 , iThrone Deluxe http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18887 , and IArmchair http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19025 have all been updated to these dimensions. In other words they are now based on real iPhone dimensions, not best guesses."
