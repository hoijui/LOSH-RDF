function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nSome attempt was made to balance the sides. This was just something I saw done elsewhere and thought it would be easy to do in tinkercad. But will it print? That is the question.  \r\n\r\nConsider this is a test of your overhang calibration.  \r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/gTd8jvxEQ2W  \r\n\r\nNew version uploaded that prints better, but this dice didn't score as for balance well as the flat dice that is derived from this one."
