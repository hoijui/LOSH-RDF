function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\n***UPDATE*** New dualed design V2 that prints better with less gaps.\r\n\r\nI am now building these and selling these on my Etsy! So if you don't have a printer yet, I will be happy to print you one! Check it out at https://www.etsy.com/listing/104143847/legend-of-zelda-hylian-shield-ring\r\n\r\nMy son wanted a shield from Zelda for his birthday. Not much chance of that but I think he's pretty happy with this.\r\n\r\nDual and single extruder models available.\r\n\r\nDesign based on a drawing by protowing on deviant art: http://protowing.deviantart.com/art/Hylian-Shield-43930076"
