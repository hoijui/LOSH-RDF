function = "**Update** New version makes the dots more readable. Original \"AllDelicateRingStubbystl\" kept for archival purposes. New version are all \"DRS\"\r\n\r\nI had trouble telling different sized printed stubby ring-a-things apart. So to make it easier in the future I've modified the design.\r\n\r\nInside each ring opposite the fastener is a series of subtle dents. The number of dents is the size of the rings. So the ring in the picture is sized 12.\r\n\r\nNow you can print off a whole set to use whenever and replenish as you need."
