function: "If you like my work I hope you'll consider supporting me on Pateron: https://www.patreon.com/3DPrintingProfessor\r\n\r\nSubscribe to me on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrjoesays\r\n\r\nProblem: My Replicator is in the garage, but my computer is in the basement office. When transporting my SD card between them I often get distracted and if I don't have pockets what do I do with the SD card?\r\n\r\nThe solution is at hand. Now I can transport my SD card even in sweat pants but keep my fingers free to take care of business along the way.\r\n\r\nYes, I actually use this thing. Every day."
