function = "I give up. I GIVE UP! I have gone out at different times of day and re-shot this statue 5 times trying to get a good capture for 123D Catch. No matter what I do this is the best I've managed to do. It looks okay from a distance, but up close the detail sucks. Club hands, no face, and random spiky things. Any attempt to manually stitch in pictures just seems to make things WORSE.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to upload the original pictures and hope that someone can make it work where I didn't or tell me what I need to do. All these pictures were taken in a single setting at the same time.\r\n\r\nAll I wanted was a plastic Jesus riding on the dashboard of my car.\r\n\r\n(This isn't the original Salt Lake Christus.. It's a reproduction that is near my work in Provo. So I'm trying to make a print of a scan of a reproduction.)"
