function = "The major addition to this version is printed supports for the body that you need to remove after printing and laying all the parts out on one plate (sized for the replicator) with pieces near their associated joints.\r\n\r\nIf you want the individual pieces you can get them from the original blockbot v2 and just replace that body for this one.\r\n\r\nEDIT: The 50% print has some serious issues that'll need to be worked out before it's viable. Really thin vertical supports and weak (broken) ankle joints. So I'm deleting that STL. The 75% still works great."
