\r
If you want the individual pieces you can get them from the original blockbot v2 and just replace that body for this one.\r
\r
EDIT: The 50% print has some serious issues that'll need to be worked out before it's viable. Really thin vertical supports and weak (broken) ankle joints. So I'm deleting that STL. The 75% still works great.""" ;
