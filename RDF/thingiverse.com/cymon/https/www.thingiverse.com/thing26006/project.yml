function: "Tired of getting your finger caught in the workings of CrazyJaw's excellent Micro Gear Heart Keychain? I know I was. It's a great thing keep around to show people how cool 3D printed stuff is but it's a bit hard to use. That's why I modified the design and added a key and a place to hold it while you turn. The effect is... effective.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** Added plates and half plates for the shorter pins. Apparently I was using the longer pins. They worked for me, but were admittedly a bit loose.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2** The new \"8\" piece (the one at the bottom) did not have enough taken off the bottom so the key would \"pop\" as it went pass making the turning stiff. If you have already printed one a few cuts with a blade will fix it. If you haven't use the V1.2 files.\r\n\r\nKey added and keyless plate for people who want to print the key at 100% infill."
