function: "ABS filament diameter can change over time. Every once in a while you need to trust if two parts are going to mate propertly. So if you've just changed filament rolls make sure you know what your filament diameter in should be in RepG by printing this small object.\r\n\r\nI actually made this to see if I could use it for my chess set, but it has been useful since then too."
