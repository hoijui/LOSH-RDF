Why buy bolts and nuts for you low stress bolt projects?\r\n\r\nI use them in in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28752 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25058 . The bolts were the most expensive part and half the time the hardware store was out of the size I needed. So I made this. It's probably not a good idea to use this where stability and strength are necessary, but for what I use it for this works great."
