function: Versions 2.2 by Thex1138 just didn't work for me. After increasing the size where it contacted the build platform I got it to print, and then the bearings fell out when I used it. In frustration I increased the sizes of the bearings. They sometimes stick after printing but a little twist and they crack free and works great.
