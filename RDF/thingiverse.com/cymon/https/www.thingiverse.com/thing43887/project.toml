Maybe this is a sign that I need to try out slic3r, but it took me hours to slice and brought my computer to it's knees. Couldn't do another darn thing. So I took it into blender, told it to decimate to 1/10th the polygons, and tried again. Still took hours to slice but at least I could use my computer while it did."
