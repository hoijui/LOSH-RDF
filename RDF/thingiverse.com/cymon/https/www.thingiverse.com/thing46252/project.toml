But recently we played a level where it became apparent we need another way to prevent someone from rushing the boss to win. So I made this, a door and a cover for a lever to match it. Now the players have to go to the switch before they open the door. And if they don't then no one else can progress to the end. It still needs some work game play wise but it looks cool.\r\n\r\nPart of this was made in Tinkercad by my son (with some help). https://tinkercad.com/things/g7UpLdTHD9k-lego-boss-switch"
