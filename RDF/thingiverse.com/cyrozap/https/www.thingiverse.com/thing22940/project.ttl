\r
The spool holders I've seen so far either don't have a foot I like, don't use the type of rod I want, or don't use the size of bearing I have on hand. This thing fixes these things for me and if it does so for you, too, great!\r
\r
I've included the OpenSCAD source and the compiled STL file.""" ;
