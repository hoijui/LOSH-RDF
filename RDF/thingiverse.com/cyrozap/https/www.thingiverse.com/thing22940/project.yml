function: "608 bearings are really cheap by bearing standards. For instance, you can get a pack of 30 608ZZ bearings on ebay for only $15 shipped (from China, of course). That's only $0.50 per bearing!\r\n\r\nThe spool holders I've seen so far either don't have a foot I like, don't use the type of rod I want, or don't use the size of bearing I have on hand. This thing fixes these things for me and if it does so for you, too, great!\r\n\r\nI've included the OpenSCAD source and the compiled STL file."
