function = "These are all the parts for a mini-Mendel, separated into build plates suitable to be printed on a MakerBot. Most of the parts stay within the 80mm x 80mm boundaries, so you don't have to worry about the Makerbot extruder running into the build platform screws.\r\n\r\nIf you find an error with a part and you fix it, email me the fixed part at cyrozap AT gmail DOT com. If you can't or don't want to fix the part, just let me know and I'll look into it.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I just added the four x-axis-clamp_4off files to the production set and to the new single-sheet of parts file. You can find the new \"Mini-Mendel in One Sheet\" file at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2606."
