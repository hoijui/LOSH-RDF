\r
If you find an error with a part and you fix it, email me the fixed part at cyrozap AT gmail DOT com. If you can't or don't want to fix the part, just let me know and I'll look into it.\r
\r
UPDATE: I just added the four x-axis-clamp_4off files to the production set and to the new single-sheet of parts file. You can find the new "Mini-Mendel in One Sheet" file at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2606.""" ;
