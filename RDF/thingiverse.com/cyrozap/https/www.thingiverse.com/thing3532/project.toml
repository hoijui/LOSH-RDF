function = "This is a replacement wind pennant for the C-vane Wind Pennant (http://c-vane.com). These things break easily, as they are the most fragile part of the assembly. So, instead of paying $35 for a whole new wind pennant, you can just replace the part that broke (or was lost, stolen, etc.)!\r\n\r\nMine broke, so I decided to make good use of my MakerBot (and save a little money) while I learned OpenSCAD."
