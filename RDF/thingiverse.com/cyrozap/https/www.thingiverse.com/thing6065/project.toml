function = "Well, I decided that none of the current iPhone 4 cases available will protect my soon-to-be-received Verizon iPhone adequately, so I'm designing my own case. To do that, though, I had to download the Apple PDF of the technical drawings of the iPhone 4. That is NOT a friendly format for ANY CAD program, so I decided that I would make it more friendly.\r\n\r\nFYI: These dimensions may not be entirely accurate. I made most of the holes are larger than the ports they surround because that's the only way making a case would work. I modeled this from the Verizon iPhone's specs so it may not work for AT&T users, but I think I compensated enough (it's really only a difference in the positioning of the mute switch).\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Most of the holes (the things sticking out in the STL) are bigger than the features they represent to help with case design--this is not really meant to be a model of an iPhone for illustrative purposes."
