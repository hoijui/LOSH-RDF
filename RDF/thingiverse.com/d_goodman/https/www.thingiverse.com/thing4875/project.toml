function = "A fun desktop Newton's Cradle to pass the boring hours in the office.  I have not printed it yet so you can be the first!  Use filament for the parallel bars on the top of the cradle and use fishing line or dental floss for the rope through the balls.  There are six balls that you could add-experiment, it may work better with less."
