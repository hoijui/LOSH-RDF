function = "i was unable to use the PSU that is normally supplied with the build kit in the US. The one I used was slightly larger than the designed brackets. (Not much, about 4mm) \r\n\r\nThis was created by hacking the original scad files available on github to extend the mount points out 5mm. This also makes the brackets even with the edge of the base and gantry.\r\n\r\nI would provide the modified scad file, but it was truly a hack job. The right way would be to define a slightly larger power supply in the electronics config file."
