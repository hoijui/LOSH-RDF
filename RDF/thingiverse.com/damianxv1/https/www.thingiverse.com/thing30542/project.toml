function = "I have Ultra narrow kitchen drawers and I needed to organize my utensils, and no store bought thing would fit these damned drawers, so... I printed one. (in 4 pieces) My drawrs are exactly 8\" wide, so if your's are smaller, might wana make one of your own. also, they fit my utensils (which are a normal size/large I suppose) so no guarantees on it fitting all your forks knives and spoons!"
