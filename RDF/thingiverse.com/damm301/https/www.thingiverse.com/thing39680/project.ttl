--- featured on wired.com: http://www.wired.com/design/2013/02/3d-printed-mini-winterfell/ ---  



This model was built from scratch, based on screen captures from the Game of Thrones title sequence. There, a short fly-over of Winterfell is shown, whilst the town builds up from the ground  .   



The model does not include Godswood which would be right next to Winterfell
