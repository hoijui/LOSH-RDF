function = "This device allows you to string an elastic cord through the hole and tighten it by 90 degree rotations. \r\n\r\nI'm still waiting on my ToM to ship, so I don't know how well this will print or whether or not the clearances will work. I placed the holes for #8 ANSI bolts (I think), but they shouldn't be hard to enlarge.\r\n\r\nedit: Rotated the models so they sat flat on the right axis, replicator g was surprisingly good at this."
