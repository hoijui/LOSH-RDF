function: "I made a quick feasibility study for 16bit Dings. We probably need about 32 bits to make it smooth, but is there a simple icon editor that could save into 1\\'s and 0\\'s ? (I just used emacs picture mode, but it\\'s a bit of a pain to work with 1\\'s and 0\\'s...)\r\n\r\nI also added an overlap parameter so that OpenScad doesn\\'t complain if 2 cubes just share a single edge. Overlap can be really small. You may pick up this idea and integrate it with the original code in some way :)\r\n\r\nOpenScad code may need to be improved. It\\'s working, but again, it\\'s just a test..."
