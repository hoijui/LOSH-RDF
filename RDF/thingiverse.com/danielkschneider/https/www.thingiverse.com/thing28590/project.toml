function = "This OpenScad module defines a hollow cylinder with parameters (outside, inside, length) that can be used for filament spooling.\r\n\r\n__Using a retort stand__\r\n\r\nIt is always better to have the filament roll on top of the extruder. If you got a high ceiling or if you are moving your printer, then you need a portable solution. Together with a \"chemistry stand\" it will make a fine filament roll holder. Buy a retort stand, i.e. the kind that is used in chemistry labs. Yours could be made of:\r\n* Two 1.2m vertical bars (with two attached \"feet\" or else attachable feet). You can take shorter vertical bars (e.g. 0.9m,) but then the horizotal bar may be at your eye-level ---\r\n* One horizontal 1m bar onto which you then can glide the roll. \r\n* Two connectors for fixing the horizontal bar. It is best to buy ones that allow to lift the horizontal bar quickly.\r\n\r\n__ Other __\r\n\r\nA hollow cylinder can be of use with several other filament spoolers."
