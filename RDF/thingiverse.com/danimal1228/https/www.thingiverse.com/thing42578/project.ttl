    okh:function """This triple fan mount is completely overkill but it works well. The newest version has full height tabs along the rear edge. Much better fit than the original. There is also a single fan mount. It is rather bulky for only holding one fan but it is designed to be attached and removed quickly to make transportation of your bot more convenient.\r
You probably want to use a quick disconnect connector to connect the fan(s) too. \r
\r
This clip is of V1 of the mount but the use is the same.\r
