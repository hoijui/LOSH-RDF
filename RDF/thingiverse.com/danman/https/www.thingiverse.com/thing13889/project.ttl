    okh:function "This is an ABS fume reducer built to plug in to the MK6+ extruder frame. The MK6+ extruder frame forms a natural \"vent hood\" when you block off the sides with clear tape. This filter reduces the ABS fumes by around 80%-90%. The hood seems to be very efficient at picking up the abs fumes, but some of the fumes make their way through the filter due to the coarse nature of charcoal filter that was used. The tubing used is sold by the yard from a big-box home improvement place and is between 30-31mm in diameter at the narrower \"plug-in portion\"." ;
