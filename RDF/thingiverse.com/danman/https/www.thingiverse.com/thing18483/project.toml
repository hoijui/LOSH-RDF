function = "This is an ABS fume reducer built to plug in to the MK6+ extruder frame. The MK6+ extruder frame forms a natural \"vent hood\" when you block off the sides with clear tape. This filter reduces the ABS fumes to an almost unnoticeable level. The inexpensive carbon â€œwater filterâ€x9d used was purchased at a home improvement store (2 for $10). The tubing used is sold by the yard from a home improvement store and is between 30-31mm in diameter at the narrower \"plug-in portion\"."
