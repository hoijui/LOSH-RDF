function: "This is an ABS fume reducer built to plug in to the MK6+ extruder frame. The MK6+ extruder frame forms a natural \"vent hood\" when you block off the sides with clear tape. This filter reduces the ABS fumes to an almost unnoticeable level. The inexpensive carbon \xE2\u20AC\u0153water filter\xE2\u20AC\x9D used was purchased at a home improvement store (2 for $10). The tubing used is sold by the yard from a home improvement store and is between 30-31mm in diameter at the narrower \"plug-in portion\"."
