function = "A salt shaker.\r\nI initially printed it with a 0.25mm gap between the outside and inside pieces, and that was too much (although I was able to make it functional by wrapping a portion of the inner cylinder with 2 layers of scotch tape). I updated the model to use a 0.10mm gap instead; hopefully this should be a much closer fit.\r\nCreated in FreeCAD."
