    okh:function """One of the drawers in my Kenmore fridge was held up by a flimsy piece of brittle plastic, which promptly broke. Since the original piece was poorly designed and not a good shape to print anyway, I printed this to snap onto the side of the drawer runner and hold it up. Kind of a kludgy solution, but it doesn't stand out too much visually and might actually be stronger than the original part.\r
