I am lucky enough to have a Makerbot in my classroom. My students and I love to use tinkercad to make our 3-D projects. This is a design made by Serigne from West Africa. It is Elsinore Castle, the setting of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. \r\n\r\nThe original tinkercad design file can be found here https://tinkercad.com/things/0B0SwzRRxaI\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave any comments for Serigne."
