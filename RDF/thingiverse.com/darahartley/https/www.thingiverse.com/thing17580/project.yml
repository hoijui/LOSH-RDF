function: "My name is Dara and I am a teacher at the Brooklyn International High School. All of my students are recently arrived English Language Learners (ELLs).  I am lucky enough to have a Makerbot in my classroom. My students and I love to use tinkercad to make our 3-D projects. This is a design that I made for our Hamlet project. It is one of Ophelia's daisies. It is a button that can be sewn onto a felt doll or a story quilt.\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/things/68HZNwgyWfX"
