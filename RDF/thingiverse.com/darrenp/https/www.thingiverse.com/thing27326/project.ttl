\r
A lot of the cheap frames you get from places like Hobby King and Ebay are designed to mount one of the cheap KK Multicopter control boards. This adapter gives both a protective housing for the Open Pilot Copter Control board, and a KK form factor.\r
\r
This is still a work in progress. I'm working with SketchUp, which whilst being very easy to use for a beginner like myself, doesn't have some of the features I need to complete this, so I will have to learn something else.\r
\r
I will be doing a lid for this, along with another mounting plate for the accessories such as GPS and bluetooth, and the RC receiver.\r
\r
Current issues: The mounting screws for the CC board are slightly off, and I can't find an easy way in SketchUp to ammend them.""" ;
