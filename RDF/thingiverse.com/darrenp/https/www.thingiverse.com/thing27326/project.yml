function: "An adaptor plate/housing to mount an openpilot Copter Control board on a copter frame designed for a KKMulticopter board.\r\n\r\nA lot of the cheap frames you get from places like Hobby King and Ebay are designed to mount one of the cheap KK Multicopter control boards. This adapter gives both a protective housing for the Open Pilot Copter Control board, and a KK form factor.\r\n\r\nThis is still a work in progress. I'm working with SketchUp, which whilst being very easy to use for a beginner like myself, doesn't have some of the features I need to complete this, so I will have to learn something else.\r\n\r\nI will be doing a lid for this, along with another mounting plate for the accessories such as GPS and bluetooth, and the RC receiver.\r\n\r\nCurrent issues: The mounting screws for the CC board are slightly off, and I can't find an easy way in SketchUp to ammend them."
