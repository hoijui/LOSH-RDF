function: "This is a mold for 'casting' the hangers for my vertical blinds. I intend to try making them out of 'polymorph' (a plastic the goes soft at a low temperature).\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Madox for suggesting the idea (and for showing me how quick it is to model them with vernier calipers)\r\n\r\nI have updated the design so that the two halves lock together instead of relying on being held in place correctly.\r\n\r\nI needed to print each half separately to fit on the build platform of my Up!"
