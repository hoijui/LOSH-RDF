function = "This is a derivative of Mk5 Bearing Retainer by Emmet (thing:5789).\r\nKudos Emmet, nice job, but I wanted something that still allows me to see the filament, gear, and pinch mechanism.  This open version hopes to provide access that, as well as still allow mounting of Stepper Indicator by Geir (thing:10116)\r\n\r\nOpenScad source file included."
