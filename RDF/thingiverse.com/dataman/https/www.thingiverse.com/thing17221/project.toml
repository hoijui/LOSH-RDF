function = "If you've done a lot of soldering lately, then you are familiar with using metallic brillo to clean the tip of your soldering iron.  More efficient than a sponge or water, it's a quick and efficient means of cleaning the tip.\r\n\r\nI gave away my holder last year, and sadly, Fry's has not carried replacements since.  Frustrated after a year, I created my own simplified version.\r\n\r\nThank you to Padawan for the great assist and patience on 8 revisions, for something so simple."
