function = "Xtremd, I love your Google Android, but wanted something just a bit smaller.  This is a 50% scaled down version of the Thing:1902. Now that it\\'s smaller, it also fits on one makerbot build plate.  Just load Android-all.STL and go!\r\n\r\nXtremd: Nice mod removing the BodyBottom, Much simpler to print now.\r\n\r\nOriginal credit to Xtremd, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1902\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  I managed to fit all the parts on 1 build plate: Android-All.STL.  Just download the 1 file and go!  Individual files still available."
