function: "This is a pulley that I worked on for my guiding filament into my makerbot.  It went through a couple of revisions into its current form.  It turned out the that hanging support for the pulley, now renamed FilamentGuide (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3566) did the job of the pulley more simply, and was therefore forked into its own object.  I'm leaving the pulley up in case anyone ever needs a simple pulley.\r\n\r\nThis thing is dedicated to ddurant of the Makerbot community for all his help in helping me get my makerbot up and running.  Ddurant, thank you man!"
