function: "This is a non-printable work in progress.  I'm looking for help from the community to complete this project.  This work is based of acolwell brilliant tractor platorm.\r\n\r\nMy concept is to adapt the existing makerbot cold build platform by splitting it into two pieces, adding spacers which the user prints, gears, motor, and the tractor, all based on acolwell's design.  I'm not sure it's possible, but would be a great simplification."
