function: "This object was inspired by the MakerBot Coin.  We at Hive13 are designing a Hive13 coin and this is our starting point.  It is a hexagon with a rim around it and a hole.  The hole makes it more of a keyring than a coin.  To learn how to model this shape, check out the tutorial created by my fellow Hive13 member at:\r\n\r\nhttp://wiki.hive13.org/index.php?title=Blender_Quick_Start_Class"
