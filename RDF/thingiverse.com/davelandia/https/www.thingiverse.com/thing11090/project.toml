function = "This is a Reprap 32bit control board based upon AVR32 (AT32UC3B0256) CPU.\r\nIt is a functional replacement for the Gen4 Aruduino mega and it's motherboard.  The code has been ported to AVR32 GCC from Makerbot G3 branch (the V2 code),\r\n\r\nStatus:  As of OCT 8th, 2011\r\n   The atmel CDC driver for USB is now running on the hardware with terminal emulators.  The next step is to port it into tha main REPRAP32 application.  I will probably try a USB branch on the main git repository.  I have not yet published a branch and need to learn how to do it correctly.\r\n\r\nI have some bare stepstick PCBs in hand now.  So I can build a full stepstick based prusia with USB reprap32 for my daughter at college.\r\n\r\nI checked the loading of the 64us stepper timer interrupt to see how much cpu time the steppers are using.  I found 22% nominal and 36% worst case.  This leaves 53 DMips of cpu still available.  \r\n\r\n \r\n I was able to drive the Gen3 stepper drivers on my Prusa with no issues.  Just a cable slide from 10 pin to 6 pin IDC.  I did not even change any settings in ReplicatorG!!!  it just works.\r\n\r\nMost of my issues were related to pin assignments and not having end stops\r\nProperly terminated.  They are now disconnected in the software build.\r\n\r\n\r\ncheck out http://sites.google.com/site/reprap32"
