    okh:function """This is an adjustable bungie clip. With this and a length of bungie cord you can secure things without the normal hooks. \r
\r
Generally, the hooks are OK but if you have a bungie cord that's too long with hooks you're kind of out of luck. And if the thing you're trying to secure is a bundle of pipes, the hooks really get in the way because they don't bend well around the bundle.\r
This clip will secure any size item (provide the bungie cord is longer than it's circumference) because it's adjustable. More importantly, it's small so it will fit better on a small item.\r
\r
The clip is fully functional right now but it could be less clunkly looking, more slim and it might help if the teeth are angled a bit. I may make some of those changes but I'm going to provide the scad file so others can do it if they like.""" ;
