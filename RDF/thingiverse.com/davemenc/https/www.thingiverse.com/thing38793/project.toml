function = "Using the die that Shiera made, I extended it to print the die in one color and the pips in the other on a dual extruder machine. \r\n\r\nYou need two extruders and one model for each. \r\n\r\nOne model is just the die; that one will print alone. The other is the pips, floating in air. Don't try to print that by itself.\r\n\r\nWhen combined, the printer should print one extruder for one model and one for the other."
