function = "It's a toy tiger. Printed on a makerbot replicator.\r\n\r\nI started with the grande yellow cat source, but ReplicatorG couldn't render it to gcode and print, so I used rhino to clean up the model and remove the grass base that's on the model but not in the original picture.\r\n\r\nTail is still too thin to print properly. Printed with 50% infill with raft and full support."
