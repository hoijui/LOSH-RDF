function = "Holder for two Microsync Digital transmitters.  They discharge the battery if the base contacts are bridged.  Considering they don't come with a cover or holder, it's an issue to deal with.  They are tiny and easily lost so I made the holder for two and put a ring on it for a ball chain or tag to keep them from getting lost."
