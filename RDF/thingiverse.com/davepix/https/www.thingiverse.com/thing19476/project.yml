function: It was a joke, it is an adapter to make your MK8 Dual Extruder Replicator into a sasuage maker.  Upon realizing that it would make a great Dual Right Angle Vuvuzela for your next first date at a football match I decided to publish it and not let all that work go to waste.  You can play your Dual Right Angle Vuvuzela to your heart's content and never have to take your eye off your date.
