function: This is a bracket to hold a Swann POV camera on the back of my bike, attached to the wedge pack under my seat.  It is inserted through a loop on the back and held at the top by the velcro holding it to the seat.  There are holes all over the bracket to allow elastic bands to be strung through which adds some shock absorbing properties to the bracket.  Also it can be used just to mount to stuff since it has lots of holes.
