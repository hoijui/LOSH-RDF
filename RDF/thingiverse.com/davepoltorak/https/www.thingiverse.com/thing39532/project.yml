function: "Designed for my house mates as a Christmas present, this is a King's Plectrum (As so designated by the crown the plectrum is wearing!) Also attaches to a key ring.\r\n\r\nStarted life as a simple design for a 1.2 mm plectrum with a tapered base and top section (For smooth strumming). It is fairly flexible and actually pretty good for playing with.\r\n\r\nAfter initial prints I started to scale by 30% to make it into the same size as a standard plectrum."
