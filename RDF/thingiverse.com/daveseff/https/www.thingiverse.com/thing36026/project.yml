function: "This is a quad copter I built. The body, arduino mount, and motor mounts are all printable. \r\n\r\nUpper body was a derivitive of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24638 as I needed to adapt an arduino base to my upper body mount. \r\n\r\nI have marked this as a work in progress as I tweak the designs, but the current version should be good to go flying! :)"
