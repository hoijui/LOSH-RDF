It's a case for an iPhone5.  There are many important differences between this case and others on Thingiverse.  The most sensitive part of an iPhone is the edge of the glass.  (The face of the glass is also sensitive, but we can't cover that!)  Other cases do not offer much protection for the edge of the glass.  Also other cases have a sloppy fit.  This case solves both problems.\r
\r
This case is made from two halves that slide onto the phone and snap together.  When it snaps together, there is a strangely satisfying click!  The two halves fit together very tightly, and will not accidentally come loose.""" ;
