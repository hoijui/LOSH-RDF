function: "Creates a flat truss from cylinders, automatically creating a triangular support structure based on the length and height of the truss desired. Takes a long time to compute, please be patient. Also, if you desire to use my point-to-point my trigonometry might be a little off. :-P\r\n\r\nEDIT: I got rid of the $fn variables that increased the resolution but increased the render time even more. Supposedly this improves printing as well."
