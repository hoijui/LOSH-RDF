function = "Using my space truss module, creates a \"platform\" with user configurable length, width, and height. Automatically generates the (possibly hundreds of) cylindrical members and does all the trigonometry for you!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Using changes to my space_truss() module suggested by qharley, the SpaceTrussBridge files have more diagonal members crossing in both directions.\r\n\r\nI also removed a bunch of translate()'s from the sub-modules in the hopes of speeding up the program. Some are still necessary to move parts to the origin to rotate them because Openscad seem's to have ignore the v=[...] parameter in rotate( a=[...], v=[...] ), which would allow rotating around a specified origin instead of the default."
