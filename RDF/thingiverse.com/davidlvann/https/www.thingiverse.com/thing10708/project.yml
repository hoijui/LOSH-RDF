function: "Combines the latest versions of my truss modules with my interlocking connectors (flush version) to create a truss that (in theory) can be printed out and multiple pieces snapped together to create lengths that can't be printed.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Updated code for calculating the length of the truss. You specify the \"max length\", which is the distance you want to span, and it makes sure the length of one connector is taken into account, under the assumption that the overlapping ends are recessed into the connector on the next truss. Or if you want to think of it another way, half of each connector is taken into account, assuming you leave them the same size.\r\n\r\nEDIT: The solid truss .scad and V3 .stl have the connectors rotated so they are printable without crazy bridging and filing down. Trusses now interlock alternating with every truss connected at 180 degrees rotated along the truss axis from it's neighbor. To connect them, I press them finger tight (about halfway inserted) then lay them flat on a table and hammer it home with my fist. :-P So far, they seem to be impossible to separate without breaking the truss, and even then I haven't actually separated them. Which was sort of the idea of a locking connector."
