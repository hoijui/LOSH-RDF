function = "I borrowed two extruder gear designs ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10538 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13286 ) and use plater.py (included with pronterface) to make a plate with 4 large and 4 small extruder gears so I could have some spares. I repaired it with netfabb basic, but I think there were errors in the original files that netfabb couldn't handle. Slic3r didn't complain though."
