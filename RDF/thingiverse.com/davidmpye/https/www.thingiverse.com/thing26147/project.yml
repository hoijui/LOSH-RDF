function: "Like Nespresso coffee but fed up with having capsules everywhere?  Think the commercial capsule holders are far too expensive?\r\n\r\nThis thing is a parametric Nespresso coffee capsule holder, so you can make a holder for as many capsules as you like (limited by the size of your build table!)\r\n\r\nThe capsules are dropped in from the top of each row, and are removed with a simple pull and lift movement from the bottom.  \r\n\r\nPlease note: This is *NOT* endorsed by Nespresso."
