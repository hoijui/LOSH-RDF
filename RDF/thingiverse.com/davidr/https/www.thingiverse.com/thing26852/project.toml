function = "This is my version of bwevans's X endstop design. I removed the overhang that was rubbing against my X motor belt mount and designed the switch to be mounted directly to the top of the endstop. Also, I made it a tad bit wider (no sanding needed to mount) and added a tension screw to prevent any movement."
