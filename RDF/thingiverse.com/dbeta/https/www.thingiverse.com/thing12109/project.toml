function = "This compact mount is designed to be customized to any touchscreen smart phone. The phone clips in and out from a simple double C shaped cross. The hooks on either piece of the cross can be adjusted to match your phone in sketchup. Included is an example of a long C for a phone that has a hump. \r\n\r\nPart C may be too large for your bot, so turning it diagonal in will probably give you enough space.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the plastic used by the Makerbot is too hard to create a suction cup, so you will have to provide some yourself. I found a bag of them at my local hobby store for about $4. Hot glue is an optional step to create a more permanent bond and stable bond, but I haven't used it yet."
