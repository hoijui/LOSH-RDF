    okh:function """This compact mount is designed to be customized to any touchscreen smart phone. The phone clips in and out from a simple double C shaped cross. The hooks on either piece of the cross can be adjusted to match your phone in sketchup. Included is an example of a long C for a phone that has a hump. \r
\r
Part C may be too large for your bot, so turning it diagonal in will probably give you enough space.\r
\r
Unfortunately the plastic used by the Makerbot is too hard to create a suction cup, so you will have to provide some yourself. I found a bag of them at my local hobby store for about $4. Hot glue is an optional step to create a more permanent bond and stable bond, but I haven't used it yet.""" ;
