    okh:function """This car mount has been designed to work with practically any phone and any case. It only uses 1 screw(3M that came with my makerbot) and 1 suction cup. The entire rest of the process is printed. There is a possibility of using a 2nd screw to completely secure the "Pressure Spinner" and a couple of rubber bumpers for really tall phones.\r
\r
It holds very solid if printed to the right size and is rock stable. This is probably the closest you can get to a factory mount off your printer.\r
\r
I would love some derivatives of this, as it took quite a bit of work to get where it is, but I still feel like it could be much improved.""" ;
