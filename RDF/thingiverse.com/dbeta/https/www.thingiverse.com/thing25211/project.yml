function: "This car mount has been designed to work with practically any phone and any case. It only uses 1 screw(3M that came with my makerbot) and 1 suction cup. The entire rest of the process is printed. There is a possibility of using a 2nd screw to completely secure the \"Pressure Spinner\" and a couple of rubber bumpers for really tall phones.\r\n\r\nIt holds very solid if printed to the right size and is rock stable. This is probably the closest you can get to a factory mount off your printer.\r\n\r\nI would love some derivatives of this, as it took quite a bit of work to get where it is, but I still feel like it could be much improved."
