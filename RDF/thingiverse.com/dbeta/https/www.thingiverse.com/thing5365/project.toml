function = "This is the basket to sit your phone in for a car mount. I'm still working out the specifics of the car mount point. I am using two part disconnecable mounting system from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4382 as soon as I figure out how to attach my phone to my car.\r\n\r\nIdeally this should fit any smartphone that is wide enough and no thicker than a Galaxy S Vibrant or i9000's hump section. I would like to make it a little more generic but I also don't want to get in the way of the screen with tabs holding it in place.\r\n\r\nThe bottom is open to allow access to bottom facing usb ports, but it is not tested, so it may need to go further back. Input would be very welcome. If you have a Galaxy S you might find that the top tabs come a little too high and block access to the power and Vol- buttons, this was discovered after printing :(. I'm working on a fix."
