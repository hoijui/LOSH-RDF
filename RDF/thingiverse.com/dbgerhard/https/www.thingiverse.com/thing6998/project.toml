function = "After literally tens of minutes of of development, I think I have a good process for making alphabet shaped cookie cutters (or any shape cookie cutters for that matter)\r\n\r\nTo build one of these in sketchup:\r\n - Make a shape and extrude it to about 1.5 or 2 cm (3/4\")\r\n - Use the offset tool to make 2mm (1/8\") line around the perimeter of the shape.  Holes in letters are problematic, you may have to draw by hand.\r\n - push the new smaller shape back to 1/8\" less than your original extrusion.  this makes a \"floor\" and \"walls\"\r\n - sharpen the walls\r\n - push \"holes\" in the base so you can get the material out after you cut\r\n \r\nNote, this is an upgrade from my previous cutters, thing 6979\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6979"
