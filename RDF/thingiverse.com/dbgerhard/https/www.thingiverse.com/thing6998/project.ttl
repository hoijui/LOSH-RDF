    okh:function """After literally tens of minutes of of development, I think I have a good process for making alphabet shaped cookie cutters (or any shape cookie cutters for that matter)\r
\r
To build one of these in sketchup:\r
 - Make a shape and extrude it to about 1.5 or 2 cm (3/4")\r
 - Use the offset tool to make 2mm (1/8") line around the perimeter of the shape.  Holes in letters are problematic, you may have to draw by hand.\r
 - push the new smaller shape back to 1/8" less than your original extrusion.  this makes a "floor" and "walls"\r
 - sharpen the walls\r
 - push "holes" in the base so you can get the material out after you cut\r
 \r
Note, this is an upgrade from my previous cutters, thing 6979\r
