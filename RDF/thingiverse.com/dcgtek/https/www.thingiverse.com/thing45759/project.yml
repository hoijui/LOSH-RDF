function: "This is a simpler version of an existing 40mm fan mount found here.  When we first got our printer running, there were no fans blowing directly at the extruder and the original design had a hard time printing cleanly. \r\n\r\nThis is a simpler version which should print just fine without fans or supports.\r\n\r\nI updated the original design with Blender, so the .blend file is attached.\r\n\r\nIt attaches to the fan mounts on the X-Carriage (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18657).\r\n\r\nWe ended up with a 10mm thick fan and a standard 20mm thick fan on either side of the extruder."
