\r
I also reduced the height of the side walls, as it will be left open.\r
\r
Lets you adjust the stepper pots if you need and keeps the PCB open to allow for better airflow.\r
\r
We did add a 60mm fan on a clip above the base.  We tried adding the fan mount to the base, but had problems with the fan mount parts not being strong enough.\r
\r
We'll revisit that at a later date.""" ;
