function: "I liked the original thing, but thought it would be better to use the base only and add a couple of mounting lugs to secure the case directly to the 2020 rail on the rear of the printer.\r\n\r\nI also reduced the height of the side walls, as it will be left open.\r\n\r\nLets you adjust the stepper pots if you need and keeps the PCB open to allow for better airflow.\r\n\r\nWe did add a 60mm fan on a clip above the base.  We tried adding the fan mount to the base, but had problems with the fan mount parts not being strong enough.\r\n\r\nWe'll revisit that at a later date."
