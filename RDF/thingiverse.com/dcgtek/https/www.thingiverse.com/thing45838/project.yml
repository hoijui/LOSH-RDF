function: "The printer we'd bought came with a y-stop but no way to actually activate it as the bed moved in the y-axis.\r\n\r\nI took the clamp that attached the bed to the t-belt as a template and modified it to have an arm that sticks out and can hit the y-stop switch.\r\n\r\nBased on http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30394"
