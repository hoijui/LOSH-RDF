function: "These are modified printed parts for the MM2 beta kit extruder.\r\n\r\n3 parts include filament guide, a handle extender, and support plate to snug the hot end to the extruder.\r\n\r\nWhat's changed:\r\n1) On the filament guide I lowered the nipple box so it's flush against the support plate and won't twist when the spring is applied. Also, moved the nipple forward and angled top corner to allow more depression of the spring.\r\n2) Support plate cutout for hot end was increased to be more snug. Also brought the holes in a tad so they line up with the aluminum holes better.\r\n3) Created a handle with thumb cutout for depressing the spring when changing filament."
