function: "The slicer was totally influenced by bohnded's cheese slicer - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9683 (thank you for the inspiration bohnded!)\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend spotted his and asked me to print one but I wanted to make it a little different by enlarging the handle and tidying the wire away if possible.\r\n\r\nI used 5AMP fuse wire as this is what I had around and knew it could handle the tension.\r\n\r\nI had to print raftless because of size so it warped a little."
