function = "Wanted to find a way to mount my 30A flat pack ebay power supply. This bracket is designed to mount the power supply on the underside of the Reprap Prusa printer. \r\n\r\nThe bracket is made parametric to allow easy adaptation if you do not have right length screw.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The STL file provided is 32mm wide from the rod to the power supply. May not fit for some printers."
