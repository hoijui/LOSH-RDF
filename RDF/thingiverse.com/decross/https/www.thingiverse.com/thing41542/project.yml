function: "This is a rocket intended to use a cx-0 rocket engine. After launch, it should launch a finned bottle rocket.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\nThis has not yet been tested, and should be tested by holding lightly at center of gravity and spinning around. If the rocket is parallel to your body, add some weight to the nose. If not, you do not need to add any weight. This rocket has no parachute, so launch away from inhabited areas, but is so light it should not break upon impact with the ground."
