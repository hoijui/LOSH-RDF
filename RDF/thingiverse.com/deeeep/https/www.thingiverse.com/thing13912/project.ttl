\r
Some amazing designs came in, but we had no people available with CAD skills to convert these sketches into 3D models.\r
\r
My appeal to all of you in the thingiverse community is to see the sketches and convert some of them into workable printable 3D models, so that we can have them printed and put in the East and West coast Project Shellter aquariums. \r
\r
This would mean a lot to the kids who poured their imagination onto paper to help out the hermit crabs!\r
\r
Some other ideas were put up by some participants whose drawing skills were not as rich as their imagination: one girl wanted a shell in the shape of a plant-pot, which could grow seaweed for camouflage, another shell was in the shape of a piece of coral reef so that when the crab hides it looks like coral reef debris.\r
