function: "On Sunday 20th November 2011 we did a workshop for 30 kids about 3D printing and while they were there we asked them to draw out their ideas for a shell for the hermit crabs. \r\n\r\nSome amazing designs came in, but we had no people available with CAD skills to convert these sketches into 3D models.\r\n\r\nMy appeal to all of you in the thingiverse community is to see the sketches and convert some of them into workable printable 3D models, so that we can have them printed and put in the East and West coast Project Shellter aquariums. \r\n\r\nThis would mean a lot to the kids who poured their imagination onto paper to help out the hermit crabs!\r\n\r\nSome other ideas were put up by some participants whose drawing skills were not as rich as their imagination: one girl wanted a shell in the shape of a plant-pot, which could grow seaweed for camouflage, another shell was in the shape of a piece of coral reef so that when the crab hides it looks like coral reef debris.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso look at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14046 for a rendition by MagicDan..."
