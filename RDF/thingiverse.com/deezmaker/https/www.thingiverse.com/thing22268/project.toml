function = "The Bukobot Fly was originally made to test out some features of my Bukobot 3D printer prototype and experiment with thin layers. Then I got curious to see if I can actually make it fly..and I did!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst 3D printable hand glider?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot sure if it's the first flying 3D printable mini airplane, but I couldn't find one anywhere that was small enough to fit on 8x8 platform and didn't require motors.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bukobot Fly has a 9\" wingspan and 0.4mm thick wings.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERY CHALLENGING PRINT!!!  \r\n\r\nThis might be a tough print to do. It took me a few tries to get a decent first layer for the wings because the crappy PLA I had was very inconsistant in thickness... But if your platform is level and your material is good, it should work. Layer height should be set to about 0.1mm with a very flat platform and I recommend using PLA for the stiffness. Also, platform needs to be at least 7x7 inches to print at 100% size, not sure if it'll work any smaller, but should work bigger possibly.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted on a Bukobot 3D printer http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21746  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE!!! I got video of it flying!!!  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQsI0d0aw8Y"
