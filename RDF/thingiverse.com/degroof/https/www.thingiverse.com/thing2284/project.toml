function = "The insulator retaining ring on the Makerbot plastruder (Mk3 and Mk4) takes a lot of punishment. If it breaks, you can't print. With these instructions, you can make an emergency replacement that'll keep you going until you can buy / print a replacement. \r\n\r\nNOTE: This isn't a precision part. It's a quick hack to get you printing again. Using this as a permanent part isn't recommended. Your best bet is, once your printer is repaired, immediately print a replacement retainer and one or two spares."
