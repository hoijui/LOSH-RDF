Basically a mount for a little wire brush and piece of a silicone spatula so you can keep the nozzle tip clean.\r\n\r\nThe TIF image has an exploded view and bill of materials.  \r\nThe zip file contains the actual model parts. (Solidworks) \r\nThe STL is of the base. (The only part you really have to manufacture beyond cutting up a brush and a spatula.)"
