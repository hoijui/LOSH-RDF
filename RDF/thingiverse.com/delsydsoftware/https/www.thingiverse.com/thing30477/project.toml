function = "Update: I have added an improved version of the adapter which prints without supports. Version 1 is still available if anyone needs it, but Version 2 is much better.  \n\nThis is a simple adapter for attaching a 1.25 inch Shop Vac hose directly to a Bosch RA1181 router table dust collection port.  \n\nThis may be usable by other pieces of equipment that use a 2.5 inch dust collection port."
