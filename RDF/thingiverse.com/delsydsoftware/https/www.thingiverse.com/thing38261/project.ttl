    okh:function """Saturns are notorious for having issues with the manual shifter. Most of these problems revolve around a little rubber cap that holds the shift cable in place. A few solutions were offered in the aftermarket, including a steel bushing that was for sale on eBay for a while (and may still be).\r
\r
The steel bushing corrected the design issue, but introduced another issue. It has a tendency to put so much torque on the shift cable that the plastic end of the cable breaks off. This is a huge problem, because it means buying a $200+ cable and spending a few hours installing it, only to have the shift cable end pop off again.\r
\r
This happened to me a few years ago, and I decided to re-attach the broken end by drilling a hole in the steel cable and attaching the old cable end with a bolt and nut. (see http://www.saturnfans.com/forums/showthread.php?t=122577 for the original discussion). This fix worked for 4 years, until the shift cable failed at another place.\r
\r
After replacing the shift cable, the end popped off again. This time, I decided to design and print a replacement. My model is significantly stronger than the original, and seems to improve the feel of the shifter as well.""" ;
