function = "**UPDATE***\r\nIt looks like I had the wrong template uploaded, which didn't have the proper spacing at the bottom of the strip. I have uploaded the proper version.\r\n\r\nI've made a few magnetic knife strips using strips of wood and neodymium magnets, but I really hate laying out the holes for the magnets. This template is intended to make the layout quick and easy. I have provided instructions for making a magnetic knife strip using this template."
