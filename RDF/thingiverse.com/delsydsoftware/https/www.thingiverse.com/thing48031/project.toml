You can find it here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1558097\r\n\r\nI needed a place to keep my Trinitite collection, along with a couple tiny samples of uranium ore and uranium glass. The little plastic jar that I had was getting a bit too cramped. So, I decided to design something much bigger and fancier, with UV reactive ABS and an obnoxiously large trefoil on the top.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sure you could use if for non-radioactive things as well. :)"
