    okh:function """UPDATE: I have uploaded two new versions of the brackets. Both are based off of technical drawings rather than my hand measurements (which were still pretty close). One design is using a screw slot, and the other is using a plain hole. Fusion 360 files are provided for both files, if you want to modify the designs for your own purposes. The original files are still available, as well.\r
\r
I have a drawer full of spare blanking plates for PCI/PCIe slots, but I rarely actually use them unless I'm doing a major upgrade. I decided to model a couple different plates, so that I can free up some space in my spare parts drawer by only printing them when I need to.\r
\r
These are based off of the dimensions of the blanking plates in the CoolerMaster HAF 932 case, but I have tested them in 2 other generic cases and they work great. There is a plain blanking plate as well as one with ventilation holes. I provided copies of the sketchup files for both, if you want to customize the designs.""" ;
