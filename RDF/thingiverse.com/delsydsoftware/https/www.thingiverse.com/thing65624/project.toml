function = "**Update 2**  \nThese plugin changes were rolled into the Sailfish version of ReplicatorG a couple months ago, which can be found here ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32084 ). So, you should only need this plugin if you are using a non-Sailfish version of ReplicatorG.  \n\n**Update**  \nI have added the ability to limit the number of layers printed. See the last bullet point below for more info  \n\nThis is a replacement for the Fill plugin used in Skeinforge 50. It adds 4 useful features:  \n\n-The ability to disable the top layers of a model for printing out cups, vases, or other hollow objects without deleting lines from gcode manually  \n\n-An automatic solid surface thickness feature, which lets you set the thickness of top, bottom, and overhang surfaces in milimeters, instead of layers. This keeps top and bottom surfaces proportional, even when printing in thin layer heights. It results in much cleaner top and bottom surfaces, even with ridiculously low infill settings and small layer heights.   \n\n-Forcing even/odd top layers. The fill patterns on the top layer of a surface are different, depending on whether there are an even or odd number of solid surface layers. I prefer to see the even layers, which use vertical lines. Odd layers tend to use slanted lines, which print more slowly and can be a bit messier. You can now choose whether you want the final layer to be even or odd.   \n\n-You can now determine how much of the object to print using the 'Object printing percentage/layer limit' feature. This lets you print 1 layer of an object, which can be handy for printer calibration. It also lets you print a custom percentage of the object, or a custom number of layers. This feature is disabled by default, and is ignored if you have Disable Top Layers enabled."
