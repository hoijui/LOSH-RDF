function: "So there are plenty of cases out there for purchase, however, when we found one that we wanted in particular it was out of stock.  So we took it upon ourselves to try to make the case we wanted on our Replicator.\r\n\r\nThis case is based on the acrylic laser cut case by Adafruit.  Actually it is their laser cut file extruded 1/8\" (3mm) to match the thickness of acrylic the design is based upon."
