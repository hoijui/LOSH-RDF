function = "This thing replaces the clip that keeps a folded umbrella stroller folded. Ours was lost in luggage land.\r\n\r\nThe STL is for 10-11mm diameter frame rods, which seems pretty standard for North American umbrella strollers. Both sides snap tightly onto the rods, but I added a channel for a zip tie to prevent history repeating itself.\r\n\r\nI banged it out in Sketchup, complete with manifold/watertightness errors; the STL is fixed in Netfabb Basic."
