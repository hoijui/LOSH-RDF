function = "This extension is designed specifically for 1.75 mm ABS filament sold by Zen ToolWorks on Amazon. It is designed for MakerGear M2's filament wheel holder, so it is nice and thick for structural purpose. I also made a thinner extension for keeping filament from falling off the cardboard wheel."
