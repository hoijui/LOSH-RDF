function = "We develop a lot of free applications dedicated to 3D printing to explore and facilitate the use of 3D printers by many. The first Image2stl, allows the creation of 3D object from a 2D base (jpg or png). Associating the colors to values â€‹â€‹extrusion, the program detects differences in color level to translate the 2D to 3D. Thus, an image composed of a gradient from black to white gradient will create a volume.\r\n\r\nThis application has been designed by the Design Association The Future Now and developed by JoÃ«l Belouet.\r\n\r\nMore infos: \r\nhttp://dothefuturenow.org/ressources/2-ringmaker-imaginer-designer-et-imprimez-vos-bagues/"
