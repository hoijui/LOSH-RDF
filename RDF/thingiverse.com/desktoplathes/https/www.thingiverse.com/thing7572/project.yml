function: Loc-Line style modular hosing is used in many ways but mainly it is configured to deliver coolant to CNC cutting tools during machining operations.  This "thing" is a first stab at making a printable version for the non-wet variety of uses.  Snap several of these together and it will form a re-positionable wire conduit (say for an LED) or arms for a helping hands tool.  Another use might be to direct cooling air to an adjustable location near the extrusion nozzle.  This version isn't nearly as strong or tight as real Loc-Line but it does hold its position reasonably well, and has a continuous hole through the middle at the maximum angle.  I can't imagine it would hold water though :-)
