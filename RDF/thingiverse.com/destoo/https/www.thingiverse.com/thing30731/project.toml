function = "This is the plan for a set of pan pipes.\r\nThe other models found did not take into account that a tube less than 7 times the width of the opening will not make any sound.\r\n\r\nA 2mm thickness of the pipe will prevent any \"leaks\". \r\nThe parametric version allows you to change the notes used.\r\nI cheated a little using numbers in inches converted to 10 milimeters each (where a C pipe should be 6 inches long, it's 60mm on this model)"
