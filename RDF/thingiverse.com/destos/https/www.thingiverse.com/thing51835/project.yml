function: "Some deets: http://patrick.forringer.com/2013/02/3d-printable-coffee-cup-with-built-in-iphone-stand/\r\n\r\nThe design has been uploaded to shapeways as a ceramic print, but not tested. So I wouldn't purchase it from there yet.\r\n\r\nI've added the source SolidWorks file for any that would like to edit it.\r\n\r\nI'll try to get a picture with how the iPhone sits in the cup arm."
