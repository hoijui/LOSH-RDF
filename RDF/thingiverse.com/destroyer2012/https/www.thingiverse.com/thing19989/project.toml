function = "Formins are proteins that regulate actin filament formation by staying attached to the growing end of filaments and stepping along as new monomers are added to the actin polymer. They protect the growing filament from capping protein, a protein that blocks the formation of unwanted filaments. This is the FH2 (Formin Homology 2) domain of bni1p, a yeast formin (1y64 on pdb).\r\n\r\nCheck out my blog for more http://pdbprint.blogspot.com/"
