function = "EDIT: Uploaded dodecahedral enzyme from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, 1b5s\r\n\r\nThis is a complex which forms the catalytic core of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme. The structure is made of 24 copies of a single protein; three copies make up each vertex of the cube. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is an enormous enzyme that connects the process of glycolysis, by which sugars are broken down, to the process of aerobic respiration.\r\n\r\nThis enzyme is actually from the bacterium Azotobacter vineladii; the human version of the enzyme forms a dodecahedron. Read more about it here http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=153\r\n\r\n1eaa in the pdb."
