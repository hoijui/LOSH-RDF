function = "The ribosome is the enzyme that translates genes into proteins. All life on earth is dependant on ribosomes, and unlike most other enzymes, the active site (as well as most of the enzyme structure) is made of RNA! Learn more here http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=121\r\n\r\nThis ribosome is from the pdb structures 2wdk and 2wdl. I painted the tRNAs in the A, P, and E sites red, green, and blue, respectively."
