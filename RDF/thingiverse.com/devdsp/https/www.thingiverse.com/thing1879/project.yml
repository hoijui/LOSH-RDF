function: "A parametrically scalable traffic cone built in OpenSCAD. I've added an example STL file of a 9x9x12 cm cone which should be printable in a CupCakeCNC as long as you centre your build platform before printing.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I shrunk the cone down in OpenSCAD and re-exported the STL file. I hadn't left enough room for the raft or the top layer. It should be printable in the CupCake now."
