\r
The attachment point was designed so I could pick and choose where to mount it - wasn't sure where I'd be putting them.  These work with the Medela bottles we have, and also have a good friction fit for the Philips Aventi feeding bottles we've got.  Works ok on a few other types, although they're too large for the Ameda bottles we have.""" ;
