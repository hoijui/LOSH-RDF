function = "Warning: not yet printed (and I don't have a printer yet!)\r\n\r\nOpenScad script to generate parametric gear racks. Only one important parameter.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 required parameters:\r\n\r\n* module: the most import parameter of any gear. Two gears (or a gear and a rack) of the same module will mesh. Determines the tooth height and this value is the pitch circle diameter in mm. Common gear modules: http://www.beltingonline.com/gears-366/spur-gears-367/metric-0-5-to-8-mod-375/\r\n* number of teeth: this parameter together with module determines the length of your rack.\r\n* width: the width of the rack in mm.\r\n* rack bottom height: the height of the rack below the teeth in mm.\r\n\r\nThe pressure angle is 20 degrees. This is not configurable since normally all MOD gears have a pressure angle of 20 degrees.\r\n\r\nWhen you print this thing please give me feedback.\r\n\r\nChange log\r\n\r\n2011-09-18: Cleanup unused code + echo length of gear rack + center object + appropriate rotation for printing + added bevel to top of teeth"
