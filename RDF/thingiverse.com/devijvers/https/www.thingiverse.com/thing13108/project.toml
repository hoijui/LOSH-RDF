function = "Here is the STL file, I've unfortunately accidentally deleted the SCAD file, will have to start over again.\r\n\r\nThe bottom (lower) part is screwed on the threaded rod (open M8 nut inside, one M8 washer and one M8 nut below). The top (higher) part is screwed on the motor shaft with one M3 nut and one M3x10 screw.\r\n\r\nBoth parts are attached with 4 M3 nuts and 4 M3x10 screws.\r\n\r\nWith this design it should be possible to assemble/disassemble multiple times without damaging the printer parts. Warning: I haven't printed these parts yet."
