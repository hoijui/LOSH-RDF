function: "I have recently built RepRapPro Mendel, and installed OpenSCAD to learn how to design physical objects. I have decided to start from something small, so this is the first model of mine: a steering arm for a mini RC toy car. How small is that? It is about 9 x 12 X 4 mm. From now on, in case if your child accidentally steps on one of their favorite RC toy car, and steering arm is broken, you can print a replacement part (of course if the broken car is the same as the one on a picture).\r\nIn mine case the left steering arm was broken, but I have also prepared STL for the right part (left steering arm is SteeringArm_l.stl, the right one is SteeringArm_r.stl)."
