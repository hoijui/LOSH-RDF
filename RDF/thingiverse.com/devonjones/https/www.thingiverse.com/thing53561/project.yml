function: "NOTE: This was an early experiment for me on dungeon tiles.  I suggest looking at [OpenForge](http://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones/collections/openforge), my newer design.  \r\n\r\nThis is a set of roleplaying tiles that can be customized using the makerbot customizer to creating printable rooms to improve your gaming experience.  \r\n\r\nThis set can be used with the customizer to create any rectangular area up to 10x10, with the ability to select different styles for the walls and floor.  You can choose be randomized stone (16 different stone faces, randomly selected every time you render the stl), horizontal & vertical wood and smooth.  All of the attached stl files for walls, tiles and segments can be generated (and more) with the customizer.  \r\n\r\nThe set was designed with a number of goals in mind:  \r\n1) expandability, the set has numerous features for attaching things like doors, staircases, angled walls, etc.  \r\n2) The ability to recreate maps from modules.  Unlike most of the dungeon tile sets, this one is based around 5 foot sections, giving the GM the flexibility to recreate most maps.  \r\n2) The ability to create more then just dungeons  \r\n3) The ability to spruce things up by having multiple styles  \r\n4) Simple ability to extend with openscad code.  \r\n5) I wanted the walls to be shorter, so it was easier to move the miniatures.  \r\n\r\nThis set is compatible with the tiles (but not the walls) from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3195.  I've included as ancestors all the projects that I feel influenced this design.  \r\n\r\nProject code and stl files are also at: https://github.com/devonjones/dungeon_tiles"
