function: "This is my 1st concept to print project. I've printed lots of stuff from thingiverse so I figured I should give back a little.\r\n\r\nThis adapter fits the older Etrex (yellow, 12 channel) GPS. I needed this so I could connect the GPS to my kenwood D710 for use with APRS. I like this GPS cause they are inexpensive and I don't mind having it dedicated to APRS."
