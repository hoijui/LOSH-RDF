function = "[update: 03/12/12] - I'm deleting the old .stl's as the new ones fix some of the flaws the first version had so if you want to print these, you want to use conn5.stl and hook1.stl\r\n\r\nI've designed a hook system for hanging grow lights on a shelf using the honycomb holes in the shelf above to attach the light for the shelf below\r\n\r\nThese hangers were designed to fit the Lights of America brand of grow lights which are available for around $10 at your local large discount mart. But they should adapt easily to any brand of light which has the \"keyhole\" shaped connections for hanging.\r\n\r\nThe shelf unit that I am using is a Plano model 9524, 4 shelf unit.\r\n\r\nThe round plugs are designed this way to allow you to adjust the height of the light easily. IE, remove the plug, raise/lower the string, replace the plug\r\n\r\nI added some action shots for clarity"
