function = "[ I've uploaded the new design which compensates for the weight causing the vent to close. The vent still closes, but the slope of the face leaves the phone at a viewable angle ]\r\n\r\nThis is a vent mount for an iPhone that fits the vents for a 2006 Dodge Ram 1500\r\n\r\nThe phone case is from Thing:4382 ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4382 ). Kudos to aylr for such a great design. I am using his iPhone Bike Mount but wanted to be able to leverage that case with a mount for my truck\r\n\r\nMy files do not include the case. You will want to download aylr's case and print it for use with this vent mount"
