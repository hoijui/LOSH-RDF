A year later I went back to build mine and found it to be incomplete  \n\n\nThis is my version of a semi-completely printable spherebot drawn using google sketchup.  \n\nI started out with the intent to make it completely printable, but Easter is coming and at the rate I'm going, I would be lucky to have it done in time for drawing on Christmas ornaments,so I've abandoned the \"completely\" printable part and used 1/4\" rods for the frame and M3's for mounting the steppers and 5/16 bolt for the egg cup holder.   \n\nIf you download the \"Spherebot all files\" file, you get the sketchups, STL's, Gcodes all in one  \n\nI have printed it as seen in the pics, however, I have already detected a potential flaw in that I'm only using 3 1/4\" threaded rods for the frame and that missing 4th corner is causing my egg to skew a bit when mounted. My problem is, if I add a 4th rod, it interferes with the position of the pen ...   \n\nI think I can work around the 4th corner missing so I've spent most of my time trying to figure out what's wrong with my wiring cause the best I can get is the egg spinning and the servo lifting/dropping the pen ..."
