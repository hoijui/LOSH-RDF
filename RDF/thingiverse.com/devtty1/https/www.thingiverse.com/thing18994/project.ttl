UPDATED 03/07/13 - thank you to all who "liked" my project, but if you are serious about building one, you really should consider building this one: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20398  

It's a great "Thing" and is complete. A year later I went back to build mine and found it to be incomplete  


This is my version of a semi-completely printable spherebot drawn using google sketchup.  

I started out with the intent to make it completely printable, but Easter is coming and at the rate I'm going, I would be lucky to have it done in time for drawing on Christmas ornaments,so I've abandoned the "completely" printable part and used 1/4" rods for the frame and M3's for mounting the steppers and 5/16 bolt for the egg cup holder.   

If you download the "Spherebot all files" file, you get the sketchups, STL's, Gcodes all in one  

I have printed it as seen in the pics, however, I have already detected a potential flaw in that I'm only using 3 1/4" threaded rods for the frame and that missing 4th corner is causing my egg to skew a bit when mounted. My problem is, if I add a 4th rod, it interferes with the position of the pen ...   

I think I can work around the 4th corner missing so I've spent most of my time trying to figure out what's wrong with my wiring cause the best I can get is the egg spinning and the servo lifting/dropping the pen ...""" ;
