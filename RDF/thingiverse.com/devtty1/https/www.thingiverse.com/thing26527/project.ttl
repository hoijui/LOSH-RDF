    okh:function """This is a camera mount for a GoPro camera designed to fit into the top of your walking stick (after you drill a hole that is the right size). I made it for the person who runs www.justtrails.com as he uses the GoPro to take lots of pictures for the hiking enthusiasts that use his web site.\r
\r
There are 2 styles in this thing. The bigger one requires a very long M4 bolt which goes thru the shaft and into the body of the camera mount making it *very* sturdy and not likely to break unless you find that you need to fend off a bear or your mother-in-law or something in which case I make no warranty as to the strength of the mount. I will, however, print one for you if you happen to break yours while fending off a bear. I'm jus' sayin' ....\r
\r
The second and smaller of the two is probably sufficient for most people and is pretty strong. I did find the support material very difficult to remove so I decide that it will function as a "key" to keep it from rotating in the hole (rather than admit I have a design flaw).\r
\r
When I ran the STL thru my slic3r, I got the infamous errors that basically tell me I'm not an engineer (go figure) so I ran the STL thru netfabb (http://cloud.netfabb.com/) and had them fix it for me. The files that have been fixed have the word "fixed" in the file name.""" ;
