function = "This is for the Franklin outdoor sports kit which includes 2 telescoping poles for holding the badminton net.\r\n\r\nI bought this set at a yard sale. Primarily because my wife keeps winning at bowling and I'm looking for some way to restore my self respect so I figure .... badminton ... surely I can beat her at badminton. Granted, I am a right-hander bowling left-handed with one eye closed using a ball designed to fit the fingers of a very small 4 year old ... but still, she wins at bowling and I can't let it go at that.\r\n\r\nwell, short story long, it was a complete set in very good condition for only $3 ... sorry, wrong story ... so I get the kit home and discover the retaining pins for the telescoping poles were broken, all except for one. I uploaded a pic of a good pin with a broken pin so you can see exactly what I'm replacing. \r\n\r\nRecognizing that she is able to beat me at bowling and can probably do the same on the badminton court since I have to play left-handed on the side of the yard where the dog does his business, I demonstrate my 3D printing prowess and commence to design/print replacements for the broken pins.\r\n\r\nField tested, mother approved, these pins work great and will help provide you with hours of family fun in the backyard (or weeks of humilating defeat in my case).\r\n\r\nNow, if I can just get the Olympic committee to add 3d printing as an officially recognized sport, I will finally be able to beat her at something."
