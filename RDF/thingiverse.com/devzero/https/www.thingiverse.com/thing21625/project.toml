function = "So years ago, I lost the top to a green alien lava lamp, rendering it less nice-looking. Now that I have a RepRap and green translucent PLA, I figured I could make my own Lava Lamp topper, so I whipped out OpenSCAD and a few minutes later I was printing a replacement part for the first \"useful\" thing I've every printed.  The alien head DXF is derrived from a Wikimedia SVG that is also CC licensed."
