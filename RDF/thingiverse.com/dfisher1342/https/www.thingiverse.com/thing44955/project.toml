function = "This is a millinery hat block, the foundation for all hand made hats. After it is printed out, a velour hat body would be steamed and stretched over it, and left to dry. Once removed, it will keep the shape of the block.\r\n\r\nMade some recent edits to separate the brim and crown blocks onto a single printable surface and added a top piece which reinforces the depression on top of the hat."
