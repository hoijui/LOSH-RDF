function: "The D-Track is a versatile, printable robot designed for both teleoperation and autonomous behaviour. Its unique design, inspired by the 4-Track by Jon Goitia [1], preserves all the advantages of wheel and track-based motion while overcoming some of its disadvantages: the articulated tracks allow the robot to handle difficult surfaces and overcome obstacles that would limit the motion of simpler wheeled vehicles. \r\n\r\nYou can find a demonstration video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeIoDcqjSoo\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13298\r\n\r\nThanks to LeemonBaird for the involute gear library: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5505"
