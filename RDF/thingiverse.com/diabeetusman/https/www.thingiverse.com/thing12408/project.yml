function: "Parts for a name sign for someone's baby.\r\n\r\nUnless your desired sign is an anagram of these letters, I doubt that they'll be helpful, but you never know.\r\n\r\nThey were just thrown together quickly in Sketchup, but I think they'll do the job.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think that all of the holes are the same size due to various scalings.  I do think the letters are the same size, though."
