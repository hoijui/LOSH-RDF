function = "iPhone 5 Car Mount Panel.  Uses M3 bolts to mount with.  The spacing for the bolts was based off an existing Griffin Universal Phone mount similar to this one: http://store.griffintechnology.com/smartphone/windowseat-3-handsfree-car-mount-for-iphone\r\n\r\nThis is only the panel part.  I plan to design a separate printed part to replace the existing Griffin part (while maintaining the same bolt spacing). I also plan to make a mount that clips into the dash's defrost vents, however this will be very car specific, but I'll add it anyway."
