    okh:function """This is my first experiment with openscad and my first thing in thingiverse! Just uploaded a test export. It should definitely be printable, but not very useful without any attachments :) Suggestions regarding the dimensions to standardize on for the attachment slot are welcome. I will add the option to put opposing magnets as a locking mechanism.\r
\r
Update: Put up a prettier export, and a pic with the new color theme available in OpenScad.\r
\r
Update: The .scad file is up! I tried to comment the code to be as useful as possible. Ask if you don't understand something, or if you disagree with some design decisions.\r
\r
Update: Put up an export with better dimensions for the interface slot.\r
\r
Update: Corrected the scale, it was off by a factor of 2. Added the magnet slot. Now you can import the slot shape from the file to add it to your mount or mountable.""" ;
