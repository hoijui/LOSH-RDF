function: "This is a mockup of a mount for a phone like gadget, parametrized and made with openscad. It is supposed to be attachable to the wristmount (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1748).\r\n\r\nThe only file for now is a test export with dimensions meant to fit an iphone. Not really printable as is without support material, and likely not very functional, though there is a chance it could be made to work with an actual iphone :) \r\n\r\nI have no acces to a 3D-printer atm., so can't test.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Uploaded an export that uses the great rounded.scad script: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1790\r\n\r\nUpdate: Decided to just upload the unreleased version of the openscad script. Will hopefully improve it once I get the Helsinki Hacklab mendel running."
