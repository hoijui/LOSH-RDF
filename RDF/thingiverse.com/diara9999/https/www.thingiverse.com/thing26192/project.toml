function = "This is a replacement part for the ubber basket/rack in a dishwasher (Rosenlew IIRC). The original ones are crumbling away, the material seems like something out of an SLS machine :) Maybe it was chosen to create a good bearing surface, but it reeks of designed obsolescence. Anyway, the machine is old but otherwise working well enough to warrant this small repair.\r\n\r\nThis is only the roller, but I will probably need the pin/hub holding the roller to the basket, as they are in almost as bad a shape as the actual rollers, although made from a more robust type of plastic.\r\n\r\nSimilar parts:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25386\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14213"
