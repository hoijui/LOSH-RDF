    okh:function """This is a replacement part for the ubber basket/rack in a dishwasher (Rosenlew IIRC). The original ones are crumbling away, the material seems like something out of an SLS machine :) Maybe it was chosen to create a good bearing surface, but it reeks of designed obsolescence. Anyway, the machine is old but otherwise working well enough to warrant this small repair.\r
\r
This is only the roller, but I will probably need the pin/hub holding the roller to the basket, as they are in almost as bad a shape as the actual rollers, although made from a more robust type of plastic.\r
