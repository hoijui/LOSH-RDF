\r
Anyway, on to interesting stuff:\r
I've refactored the code, making the parametrization better, and added a roll holder so that a label roll can sit inside the dispenser. Currently the size of the roll is limited somewhat, I intend to refactor some more to make allowances for bigger rolls. Support for packing tape might come too. A handle is planned, and I have some vague ideas to mechanize it, in the spirit of packing tape dipensers. If anyone can link pics of the inner workings of one, it would be useful ;)\r
\r
Update: Added a guard that should keep the roll in. Handle might be coming next...\r
\r
Update2: Refactored the code so that now it can be adapted for bigger rolls automatically, see image. I'm mostly pleased with the code now.\r
\r
Update3: Added a handle!\r
\r
Update4: Added holes for some proper two-handed label dispensing action :) Now the label strip can be pulled from under, behind the handle. This is in preparation for making it (semi) automatic soon.""" ;
