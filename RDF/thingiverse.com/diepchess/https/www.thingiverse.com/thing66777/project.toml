function = "Modified existing design. Added 2 more attachments to frame for more solid attachment. Moved motor upwards a bit so that the Y-belt is reasonably horizontal, as i had a 0.8 micrometer difference each millimeter caused by attachment to printbed being higher located than the wheel. Made holes saving out plastic a tad smaller for stronger object. Wasn't luxury.\r\n\r\nAlso made part a tad larger as the original which was 70 mm, it didn't fit. This one is 72 mm. So first measure whether that's the distance you need, as 72 mm means screwholes are based upon 70 mm distance between the extrusions. Note some plastic gets underneath extrusion. This isn't a problem for the default Mendelmaxes as it already rests onto plastic, otherwise modify it in the openscad file also attached here. The original part would mean you need 68 mm between the 2 extrusions which is a weird number. Not sure how that could've worked for anybody, but well there is many incarnations of mendelmax!"
