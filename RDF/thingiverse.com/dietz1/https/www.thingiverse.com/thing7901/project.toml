Drop IN!\r\n\r\nI downloaded this file from Sketchosaurus in Google 3D Warehouse.\r\n\r\nhttp://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/search?viewer=15593598158642524994&scoring=m\r\n\r\n\r\nI then cleaned it up using Netfabb online and scaled it for printing on the Thing-O-Matic.  It prints out pretty nicely with an MK6, kind of a cool piece to try out your reversal values and new nozzle settings.  The beams and overhangs can be printed without needing cleanup, depending on your settings.  I was pretty surprised by that."
