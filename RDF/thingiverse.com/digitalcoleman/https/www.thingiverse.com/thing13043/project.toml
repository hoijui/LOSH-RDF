function = "This was created in reaction to the New Museum challenge and the simple question - what could we make that would make life easier. My partner replied \"something to make sure your bathroom stall doesnt pop open and is also a hook for hanging a purse or jacket.\"  The great features of the design are:\r\n- it folds up for portability\r\n- the weight of the purse or jacket is what keeps it in place and provides the locking power\r\n- it can be printed in one build\r\n- you can add words to the side if you want to mark it occupied in a personal way\r\n\r\nThis was not a derivative, but instead an original design.  It is an attempt to solve a common problem with steel doors and their insufficient locks in public bathrooms.  The very low expense means that it is affordable for all, and it can be scaled for your most common everyday situations if needed. (for instance if your office restroom has extra thick doors)  The design includes a beveled slot so that it should adjust to most door sizes."
