function: "This is my graphical equivalent of \"Hello World\" whenever I learn a new language. It is a great way to learn how to draw in the graphics primitives and usually involves some good math...\r\n\r\nI've ordered a Prusa Mendel kit and learning OpenSCAD is part of the adventure. I've opened this in repsnapper with no problem, but have no idea if it would print. If you print it, and it comes out nicely, PLEASE send me a picture :)"
