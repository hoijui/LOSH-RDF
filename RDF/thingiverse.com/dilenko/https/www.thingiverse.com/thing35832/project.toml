function = "This trolley coin is just like all the other trolley coins on thingiverse BUT it comes in one pound / one euro flavour AND its got a tail with a round thing to facillitate easy removal.\r\n\r\nThe idea is this coin lives in your wallet without the risk of it being used for currency (which always happens with my other coins)\r\n\r\nYou could put it on a keyring as well but I wouldn't...\r\n\r\nHope it comes in handy!\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nEsta moneda es para insertar en el carro de la compra.\r\n\r\nLlevala en tu cartera para cuando la necesites :o)"
