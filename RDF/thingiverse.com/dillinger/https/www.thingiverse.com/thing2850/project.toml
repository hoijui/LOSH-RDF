function = "ENJOY HUMANITARIAN RODENT RELOCATION!\r\n\r\nJoining in on the mouse trap craze is the Flaptrap.\r\n\r\nThe theory is simple. Door opens from one way.\r\n\r\nThe trap comes in three parts.\r\nThe Door which slides into the body and tightly clips on to a solid hinge.\r\nIt will open when small pressure is up on it but is blocked from opening on the opposite side.\r\nThe body houses the animal obviously. It includes a built in clip as seen in the pictures. This inserts into end of the unit with liners on each side to allow for smooth placement and more security of the animal. Simply press down on the the clip to remove the end from the body and release the trap without harm to creature. The flaptraps end piece also includes a small baiting shelf to make sure the animal reaches the end allowing the door to close.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit is certainly makerbotable. Though I have not tried it yet."
