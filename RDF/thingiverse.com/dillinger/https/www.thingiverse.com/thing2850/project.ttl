\r
Joining in on the mouse trap craze is the Flaptrap.\r
\r
The theory is simple. Door opens from one way.\r
\r
The trap comes in three parts.\r
The Door which slides into the body and tightly clips on to a solid hinge.\r
It will open when small pressure is up on it but is blocked from opening on the opposite side.\r
The body houses the animal obviously. It includes a built in clip as seen in the pictures. This inserts into end of the unit with liners on each side to allow for smooth placement and more security of the animal. Simply press down on the the clip to remove the end from the body and release the trap without harm to creature. The flaptraps end piece also includes a small baiting shelf to make sure the animal reaches the end allowing the door to close.\r
\r
\r
Unit is certainly makerbotable. Though I have not tried it yet.""" ;
