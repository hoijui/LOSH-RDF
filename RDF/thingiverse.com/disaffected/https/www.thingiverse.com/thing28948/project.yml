function: "This is a replacement for the center plastic wiper pivot for a Nissan 200SX S13 (nb: may also fit an S14).  The mount can and does fail over time and is the source of the squeak you often hear from the wipers.  It's especially prone to breakage when you attempt to remove it to fix a problem with the wiper connecting rods (which is what happened to me).\r\n\r\nABS is probably the best material for the job - cars get hot and PLA with its lower melting temperature is likely to warp."
