function: "i seem to always need a project box so i decided to make one, i get my bread boards from seed studio, i use the 7cm X 9cm the most often so i decided to make it for them. i have embossed on side some openings so that they should be a little less trouble to cut out. so i hope any how. i have up loaded the stl files, i hope one of the lid and box seperatle, the the collada file and skp file should have them both in there \r\n\r\nyou can find out more about my other projects here http://mike-mack.blogspot.com/"
