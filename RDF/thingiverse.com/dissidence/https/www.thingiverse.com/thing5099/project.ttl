\r
each of the stright pieces is 150mm by 100mm with a 50mm overlap i am not sure if that is a bit big or not, but at the time it seemed like a good size to work with.\r
\r
update \r
\r
i have finished the frame so i wanted to know what people think of it please let me know.\r
\r
i up loaded one more file that is smaller the pieces are 80mm X 120mm this one you can print on a mendle with out any trouble. it is also at a 120deg so that with this one you will only need the 2 pieces to make the whole thing.""" ;
