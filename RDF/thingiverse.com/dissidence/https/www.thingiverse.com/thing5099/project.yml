function: "today i had this idea so i thought i would try to get the basics of it modeled, it is not done yet, and i would like to see what people think of it, i think it could work, so i welcome the feed back.\r\n\r\nhttp://mike-mack.blogspot.com/2010/12/crazy-idea.html\r\n\r\neach of the stright pieces is 150mm by 100mm with a 50mm overlap i am not sure if that is a bit big or not, but at the time it seemed like a good size to work with.\r\n\r\nupdate \r\n\r\ni have finished the frame so i wanted to know what people think of it please let me know.\r\n\r\ni up loaded one more file that is smaller the pieces are 80mm X 120mm this one you can print on a mendle with out any trouble. it is also at a 120deg so that with this one you will only need the 2 pieces to make the whole thing."
