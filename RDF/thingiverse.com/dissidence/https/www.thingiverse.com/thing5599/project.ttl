\r
you can see how it is supposed to look by looking at the other one in my profile, i like the idea i just need to do some more work on it still.\r
\r
in the picture there the 4 pieces are 1 corner piece 1 of the straight pieces , the other 2 are going to be rod holders, the one with the parts sticking out is for the top of the y axis and the other one there i am still trying to get my angles right on so that i can make sure it is printable i will be for the x axis rods but i still have more work to do with him.""" ;
