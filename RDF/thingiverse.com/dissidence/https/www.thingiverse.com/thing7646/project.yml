function: "this is a little model i made, it is a copy of one i made years ago in school, in welding class, i called it #1 because it reminded me of the old oil rigs i see in photos.\r\n\r\none fellow told me it looked like the old #1 oil derrick so thats how i ended up giving it that name. \r\n\r\ni know with the top it will not be easy to print, but i do hope to try to print it some day. this is more or less a personal challenge, but i thought i would share it."
