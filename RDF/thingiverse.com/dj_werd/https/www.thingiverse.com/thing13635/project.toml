function = "This is a case that is designed to make an iPad2 drop proof.  The iPad2 is being used to teach a young autistic person communication skills.  The idea is that the two halves \"slide\" together and lock in place with the dovetail.  This is rev 1 and has been dropped already.  The case suffered the brunt of the impact and cracked as was intended.  Rev 2 will include features to improve gripping ability."
