function = "This piece is meant to be used to allow smooth linear motion in a light duty cnc or printer.  \r\nI designed this based on a method I saw somewhere on the web for mounting 608 bearings to a piece of angled aluminum.  If i remember where i saw it i will update with a link. The idea is that you turn a square tube 45 degrees, and this will roll along the top of it. You could also use a piece of angle iron too, laying on its hypotenuse.   There are mounting holes that allow you to mount something on top of it.  I have not printed this yet as I am still awaiting a heated build platform. Comments are welcome as this is my first thing.  \r\nImage is of the Angle aluminum version.  The advantage of printing this is you get precisely positioned holes, and a flat surface on top with mounting holes."
