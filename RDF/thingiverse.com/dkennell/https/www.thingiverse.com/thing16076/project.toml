function = "This MendelMax inspired printer is compact, lightweight, and totally self contained.  Nothing protrudes beyond the frame.  Z axis motors are mounted low, and thrust bearings carry the weight.  Note that the z axis uses the aluminum extrusion for a guide, saving space and expense. The linear bearings and belt and pulley upgrades give high quality prints.  All dimensions are chosen so that you can use 4 smooth rods and 2 threaded rods, plus all other parts from you mendel.  \n\nAll parts are easy to print without support. The 60 W onboard power supply runs the motors and extruder heater.  The heated bed used a 120 vac and a solid state relay.  The extruder is very accessible. The heatsinks on the extruder are optional, but help keep thing cool when printing ABS.   \n\n\n\nSee BOM and exploded veiw of X axis below  \n\n\n\nI added a pdf of an exploded frame drawing 1/19/12  \n\n\n\nWire clips and T-slot cover for Misumi extrusions are at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16344  \n\n\n\nBelow is a zipped archive of all the Inventor source files.  \n\n\n\nFull BOM added per several requests.  \n\n\n\n.stp files added.  \n\n\n\nSee video of this printer at http://youtu.be/JysNv3Hi67k"
