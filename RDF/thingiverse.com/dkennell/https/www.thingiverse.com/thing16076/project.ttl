    okh:function """This MendelMax inspired printer is compact, lightweight, and totally self contained.  Nothing protrudes beyond the frame.  Z axis motors are mounted low, and thrust bearings carry the weight.  Note that the z axis uses the aluminum extrusion for a guide, saving space and expense. The linear bearings and belt and pulley upgrades give high quality prints.  All dimensions are chosen so that you can use 4 smooth rods and 2 threaded rods, plus all other parts from you mendel.  

All parts are easy to print without support. The 60 W onboard power supply runs the motors and extruder heater.  The heated bed used a 120 vac and a solid state relay.  The extruder is very accessible. The heatsinks on the extruder are optional, but help keep thing cool when printing ABS.   



See BOM and exploded veiw of X axis below  



I added a pdf of an exploded frame drawing 1/19/12
