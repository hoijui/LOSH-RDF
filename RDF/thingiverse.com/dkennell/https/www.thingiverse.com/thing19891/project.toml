function = "This printer won't quite fit in your pocket, but it is very easy to take with you.  I designed the printer around two constraints. First, the high mass motors and extruder are stationary.  This allows smooth high speed printing, as only the print bed moves.  This keeps the forces on the slides low as well.  This will also allow dual extruders on a very lightweight printer. Second, the  slides are all integrated, using PLA bearing surfaces running on the extrusions. I wanted to try this on all the axes of a printer since it works so well on my Aluminum Mendel.  It is self-contained, with power supply on board. It is very robust, and makes top quality prints. I made this printer to test the above constraints, but it works so well I decided to publish it.\r\n\r\nThe print volume is 120mm W x 100mm D x 65mm H.  This could be expanded a little by getting longer extrusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPocket Printer on Marlin - http://youtu.be/lAwCmbKS-yQ\r\n I have comb activated, so it travels around the cord cutout on this iPhone dock at a very rapid travel speed.\r\n\r\nWatch this printer and my Aluminum Mendel http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16076 print side by side here http://youtu.be/JysNv3Hi67k\r\n\r\nI posted a video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tpOokI6_Z0\r\nI wanted to see if it could print vertically.  It is printing a stretchy bracelet - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13505.\r\n\r\nI hope this inspires others to expand on this design."
