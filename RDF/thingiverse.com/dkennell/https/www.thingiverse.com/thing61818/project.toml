It can be mounted to a vertical x axis with 70 mm spacing or can be mounted to a horizontal axis using the hot end mounting bolts.  It is for the MakerGear hot end with the standard mounting pattern.  The shaft is really milled rather than hobbed, which gives a much better \"bite\".  It uses steel gears from Misumi which give a 5/1 gear ratio. The aluminum mounting plate acts as a heat sink, so fan cooling is unnecessary.   \n\nThis extruder/carriage is about 1/2 the weight of the original on the Aluminum Mendel, allowing for faster prints and smoother operation.  \n\nSome weight comparisons to common extruders:  \n\ngearExtruder -  311g (11 oz)  \n\nWade extruder - 549g (19.3 oz)  \nMakerGear 5 /1 - 457g (16.2 oz)  \nMinebea PG35L w/fan - 178g (6.3oz)"
