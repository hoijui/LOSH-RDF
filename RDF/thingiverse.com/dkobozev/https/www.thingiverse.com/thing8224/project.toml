function = "A stand for a Craftsman multimeter that I own. The multimeter has its own stand, but it sucks, so I made my own by extruding a dxf drawing using OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nI'm pleased how it came out - it's stable and looks kinda cool. Because the contact area with the surface is quite small, it can skid a little on hardwood tables."
