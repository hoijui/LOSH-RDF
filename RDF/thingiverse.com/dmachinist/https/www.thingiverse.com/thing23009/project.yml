function: It's nice to be able to print at night without having to light up the room. I had an old power supply and my Nephew gave me some 12v LED strip lighting. On the sides I just zip tied it to the existing wires, then the brackets just clip on the extruder carriage. The Makerbot lights are cool but I couldn't see right under the extruder when the print started.
