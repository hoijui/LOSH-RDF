function: "I was power sliding in the front yard and hit the curb, snapping off the rear wheel.  I had cracked the hub that hold the bearings for the rear axle.\r\n\r\nAlthough I glued the pieces back together, I figured that I might as well model the part and make it available here.  :)\r\n\r\nI just did a test run in the street, and the car runs great!  Woo hoo!"
