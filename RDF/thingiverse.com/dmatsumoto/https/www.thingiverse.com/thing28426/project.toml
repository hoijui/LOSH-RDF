function = "I have several Gorilla Racks in my garage that I wanted to slide, but they won't budge without assistance from furniture sliders.  My two gripes about furniture sliders is that 1) they are expensive at $10 for a set of four, and 2) you can't butt two racks up against each other because even the smallest pads are too large.\r\n\r\nI decided to try to print something that would give the corners of the racks a little more surface area, be easy to install, and also enable me to put racks next to each other."
