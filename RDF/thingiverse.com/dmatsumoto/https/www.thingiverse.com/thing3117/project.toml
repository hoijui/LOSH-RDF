function = "My kids want to wipe their mouths on the hand towels in the bathroom after brushing their teeth, which is gross.  I wanted them to start using facecloths, but they are so small they always fall off of the towel bar.  This clip attaches to the facecloth and then clips onto the towel bar.\r\n\r\n**UPDATED 2010-05-18**\r\n\r\nRobertHunt sent me an optimized STL file.  I skeinforged it and did a test print to make sure it worked okay.  Everything looked great (see uploaded picture of part on the MakerGear heated build platform -- it's Robert's).  I recommend that you download that file since it's *way* smaller!"
