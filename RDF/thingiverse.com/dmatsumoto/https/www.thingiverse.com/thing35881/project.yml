function: Our new dryer has an annoying thin screen that allows too much lint to bypass it, and we have to constantly try to vacuum it out.  But the attachments I have for the Dyson don't get into the nooks and crannies, so I came up with an adapter that would allow me to use an ordinary plastic hose.
