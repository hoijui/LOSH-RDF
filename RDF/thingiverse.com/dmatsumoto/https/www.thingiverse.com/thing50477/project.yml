function: "Ok, I forgot to get a card.  But I did order flowers, so I didn't need to print some.  Well, I whipped up a quick \"I Love U\" model and printed it out.  I think it'll be good enough!\r\n\r\nThe rendering here is flipped, likely because I modeled it that way.  The heart has a recessed area to give it a little more depth, and the letters are slightly raised."
