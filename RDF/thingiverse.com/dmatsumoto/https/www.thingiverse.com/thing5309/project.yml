function: "Ever have a dinner party where you don't want to roll with the Dixie + Sharpie?  Your guests invariably get their cups all mixed up, and just create extra work for the dishwasher (you).\r\n\r\nI came up with a simple idea, which is to make a ring with an embossed section for the name.  My first attempt was just the ring and I wrote my name in sharpie.  The improved version was inspired by Tony Buser's Parametric Name Tag (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2055).  However, I wanted to use a specific true type font and therefore couldn't use his work, so I based my approach off of example008 in the OpenSCAD examples folder.  I didn't like the ring-around-the-middle-of-the-glass approach, so I changed the parameters so the ring just sits on the table (but you're still free to change it!)\r\n\r\nThis was my first piece with OpenSCAD, and boy do I love it."
