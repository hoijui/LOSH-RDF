function: "We have a Crate and Barrel media center that has two doors that open outward.  There isn't any ventilation and I'm too lazy to cut holes in the back and mount fans, so we leave the doors propped open with a stuffed animal.  The problem is that our baby likes to pull the stuffed animal out, or worse, lean against doors (which means pinched fingers).\r\n\r\nI designed a prop piece in OpenSCAD that grabs onto each door, and keeps it a specified distance from the media center frame.  I added holes to the posts so I could put a #6-32 screw in for reinforcement (that's all I had readily available in the garage)."
