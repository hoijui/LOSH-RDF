function = "Two problems exist in my household: 1) my Comcast DVR is on the lower shelf of our media cabinet, and the door frame blocks the IR receiver, and 2) in the master bedroom we have our set-top boxes stacked, so anything with ventilation on top can overheat.\r\n\r\nI designed this parametric foot pedestal so it could be altered for use with (hopefully) any set-top box.  I hope it works for you, too."
