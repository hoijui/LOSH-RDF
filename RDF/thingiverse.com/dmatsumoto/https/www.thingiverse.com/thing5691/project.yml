function: "I have an LCD that requires level shifting before I can connect it to my PC.  I purchased a Sparkfun PRT-00133 RS232 level shifter for this very reason, but it doesn't have any mounting holes (and the LCD doesn't anyway).\r\n\r\nThe solution I came up with was to print a carrier, and then I could attach the PCB to it, and then double stick tape everything to my LCD.  The PCB attaches to the carrier via the included jackscrews."
