function: "(taken from my blog post: http://matz-make.posterous.com/whuzzat)\r\n\r\nIt's funny how something that started out as a simple toy replacement turned into... Whuzzat?  My son loves Ben 10, and has that Omnitrix toy that's a huge watch that's impossible for a kid to put on himself.  My goal was to create something that made him feel sort of like Ben Tennison, but also something he could put on himself.  Thus, I came up with this design.\r\n\r\nI made it with OpenSCAD because I wasn't sure if I would get the dimensions correct, or if I'd need to make small changes to make the wristband fit more comfortably.  I modeled it in such a way that I could specify the wrist width and thickness, since these are pretty easy measurements to take.  Then of course, you would want to specify the thickness of the band, as well as its length.  There also needs to be an opening on one side in order to put on the band.  With those parameters, I created Whuzzat.\r\n\r\nBy now you're probably wondering how a Ben 10 wannabe toy could be called something like Whuzzat.  Well, when I thought about this design, it was more than just a simple Omnitrix.  It was also a simple bracelet that you can print for your daughter.  Using tricks from Tony Buser's parametric nametag (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2055), or the the OpenSCAD code for my Parametric Cup Name Tag (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5309), you can put a name on the bracelet!\r\n\r\nMy wife uses a hook in the closet to hold wet towels on a hanger if there isn't enough room on a towel bar.  Well, by modifying the parameters for the Whuzzat, you can have one, too!\r\n\r\nHow about Halloween decorations?  Narrow the \"wrist thickness\", lengthen the \"wrist width\", thicken the band, and narrow the \"opening width\", then print a bunch of Whuzzats in black, and you have a chain!\r\n\r\nWhat about cable organization?  Why buy an expensive cable track, when you can print a few Whuzzats that fit inside of each other?  Screw the smaller one to your desk, then snap the larger one over it!\r\n\r\nIt's amazing how such a simple design can be used in so many different ways.  Can you think of any others?  If so, please post your derivatives!"
