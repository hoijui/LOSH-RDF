function: "I wanted to be able to make my own base using StefanHH's ball socket part, because the ball in BallSocket fits well in the socket, but the ball in his BallFlange part doesn't.  I'm planning on adding Lego-compatible features to it.  So I borrowed an ME's workstation and modified the SLDPRT and here it is.\r\n\r\nAs a test, I imported the SLDPRT into Alibre Design 2011, and I was able to add a test boss feature to the base.  I think it'll work well for everyone!"
