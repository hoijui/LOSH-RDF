function: My wife picked up this really cool popsicle maker (http://bit.ly/g7Yz7u) from Zoku.  They also sell a stand that holds several pops, but it's pretty expensive.  She asked me if I could make her a cheaper stand, as she didn't really need the cover anyway.  It works very well!  I'll post pics w/ pops the next time we make some.  :)
