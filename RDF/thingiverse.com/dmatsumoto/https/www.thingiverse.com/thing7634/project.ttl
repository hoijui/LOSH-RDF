I made a mistake on the first print, and the hole for the mini USB connector is too small.  I had to open it up all of the way so that the plug can mate closer to the board.\r
\r
The design also precludes any need for support material, since the hole for the mini USB plug is open, and I have a 30 degree angle in the slot that holds the board in place.""" ;
