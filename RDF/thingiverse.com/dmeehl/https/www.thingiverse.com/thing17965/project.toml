function = "This is a bracket used to mount a dial gauge to the extruder body. I've got mine mounted on a Greg's Hinged, but it should be mountable on other extruder bodies. \r\n\r\nThe bolt hole for the extruder is sized for an M4 or similar bolt. The bolt hole on the dial side is size for an M5 bolt and is slotted which makes it trivial to add/remove the dial itself.\r\n\r\nNote: The photo of the bracket by itself on the table is an older version. The version actually mounted in the other photos is much beefier to prevent flexing."
