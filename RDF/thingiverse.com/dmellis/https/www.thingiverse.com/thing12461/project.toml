function = "For programming the AVR ATtiny45 and ATtiny85 microcontrollers from Atmel without any additional circuitry or components.  This acts like a USBtinyISP (http://ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/) but provides an 8-pin socket for placing the ATtiny45/85 directly into the programmer.  The firmware is a combination of USBtiny (http://dicks.home.xs4all.nl/avr/usbtiny/) and V-USB (http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html)."
