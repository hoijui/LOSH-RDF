function: "The MakerBot Watch (The Makerwatch) is a great platform for developing new directions in open source electronics. But Bres current laser cut watch housing leaves something to be desired (sorry dude :). And, not everyone is up to the challenge of cutting steel or modeling in 3d to make a new housing.\r\n\r\nThe SSG design framework, developed by Dominic at the Humblefactory, breaks an object down into different functional layers -- skin, skeleton, and guts. The exciting thing about this separation is how it makes the process of making derivative objects, or entirely new remixes much easier. All you need to know to make a new SSG watch is how to sew, and where to buy some fly fabric. The skin gives most of the style, and some of the function (clasps, pockets, pen-loops -- you decide!)\r\n\r\nOr, if you are slightly more adventurous, you can model a new skeleton using the blender template provided. Then, stitch up a new skin, and get ready to share an entirely new watch form factor -- I included a pocketwatch skeleton to get your brains pumping, but think about what else you might make. \r\n\r\nBest of all, the SSG framework gets more makers involved in the iteration process -- My goal is to get as many revisions of this watch living in the wild as possible. I would LOVE to see additional sensors, etc built onto Bres basic bits. Maybe a pedometer? Temperature logger? Dangerous Noise Level Detector???\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, be sure to share your derivatives. Every new design within the Makerwatch SSG ecosystem makes everybody's watch more valuable. Take a look here for more inspiration about SSG:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.humblefacture.com/2010/08/ssg-framework-for-more-sustainable.html\r\n\r\nHappy Making,\r\nDominic\r\n\r\nPS - The current file is not makerbot-able cleanly, due to overhangs. However, I am working on a two-halves mod which should make it come clean on the bot. If anyone wants to jump on this before me, I am kinda busy with a sewing machine bike... http://www.humblefactory.com/search/label/ProductionCycle\r\n\r\nPPS - Big ups to Matt and the crew at Metrix Createspace in Seattle, as well as Andy Davidson, who helped a flustered maker to pull this puppy together with epic speed. Finally, Mark Ganter at OPEN3DP was instrumental in getting me prints of the skeleton before my makerbot was online."
