function: "Building on the Makerwatch SSG that I published a while back, I wanted to create a solution for people building Arduino prototypes, so they didn\\'t have to resort to beige boxes. This skeletal piece allows users to create flexible SSG cases for their arduino projects by clipping on skeletal supports, and covering the skeleton with a skin. In fact, this skeletal piece can work with any circuitboard, though minor adjustments to the mesh must be made, depending on the width of the board.\r\n\r\nThe compared to an injection molded housing, this system is much cheaper to make in small runs (especially if users make their own skins). Additionally, the system can be adapted to a variety of configurations modular board chunks -- as you can see, there is a transparent area of skin covering a touch screen. The screen works, as demonstrated in this explanation video:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JtB_P1oORI\r\n\r\nThe SSG design framework, developed by Dominic(me) at the Humblefactory, breaks an object down into different functional layers -- skin, skeleton, and guts. The exciting thing about this separation is how it makes the process of making derivative objects, or entirely new remixes much easier. All you need to know to make a new SSG object is how to sew, and where to buy some fly fabric. The skin gives most of the style, and some of the function (clasps, pockets, pen-loops -- you decide!)\r\n\r\nI will be updating this description as I complete more tests to the design. Stay tuned, and in the mean time, give it a test yourself!! You can find all the components linked below, or roll your own with boards and shields you have laying around. I\\'m particularly interested to hear what sort of sensing you might do with a \\\"Tricorder\\\" -- chime in in the comments, or send me an email @ The Humblefactory."
