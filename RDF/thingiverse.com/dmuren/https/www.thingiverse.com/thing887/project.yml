function: "This is my skull. I know it's not the first skull on Thingiverse, (see here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:827) but I thought I'd back it up just the same, in case I needed another copy someday:) \r\n\r\nI extracted the mesh from an MRI that I had done as part of a friend's research project at Princeton University (although I have had success getting MRIs from the doctors office too). The MRI comes as a hdr file, which is basically a stack of high dynamic range images of slices of my head. I used Osirix ( http://www.osirix-viewer.com/ ) a free, open-source viewer to read and convert the file, which I exported as an OBJ, and imported into Blender. There was a SIGNIFICANT amount of cleanup necessary, and lots of finessing of the mesh to make it watertight and manifold -- in order to reduce my work, I selected only the better half of the mesh, and mirrored it, so that's why it's erily symmetric. I swear I have a pretty normal looking head, even without editing. \r\n\r\nTeeth proved a problem -- they have a different water content than bone, and didn't all get caught by the scan -- so I just left them out.\r\n\r\nI also joined the mandible to the skull to facilitate printing. Otherwise, that joint gets really thin, and you would have to print out multiple parts.\r\n\r\nI'm releasing this under a attrib, CC, share-alike license. I would love to see all kinds of weird stuff derived from it (even commercial stuff is OK) -- just drop me a line of you make something awesome!!"
