function = "This is my updated version of the RepRap Mendel Y Pulley.  Designed to bring the belt teeth out beyond the stepper mount and still have plenty of pulley on the shaft to insure the rotation is true.  Unique is the second part that is glued (use a little Super Glue) to cap the end of the pulley and capture the belt."
