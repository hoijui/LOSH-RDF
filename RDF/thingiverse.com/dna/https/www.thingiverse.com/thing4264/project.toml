function = "I saw MBI cork board last night and immediately thought it was a good idea. I had almost completed my purchase of them when I realised that the postage was going to be more than the item. So I left it in my cart for when I buy something else.\r\nAs an idle thought I fired up SW and tried to design one. I'm not sure that dimensions are totally accurate as I could only find the Imperial dimensions for the NEMA 17. \r\nSo, this is a work in progress. It will be updated once I have printed one and installed it.\r\n\r\n(I take no responsiblity for any damage you might cause to your bot, self or small pets in the area.)"
