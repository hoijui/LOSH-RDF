This implementation uses a cover which rides in a sliding dovetail joint.\r\n\r\nFor other implementations, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12279 (cover is sandwiched between the wood and a plate) and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16415 (cover slips onto the screws which need to be loosened a little to again remove the cover)."
