function = "The definition of the English word \"egg\" ready to print on your very own egg (with an Eggbot, of course).  A great visual aid for those learning English!\r\n\r\nThe concept for this design was inspired by a similar design by Tim Docker.  And, BTW, doing this design was my impetus for writing the Spiral Text Eggbot extension for the Eggbot.  So, foreign language speakers out there: you too can render your language version of this design using that extension."
