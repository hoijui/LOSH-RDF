function = "Sine and Lace is an Inkscape extension intended for use with the Eggbot.  It may be used to draw sinusoidal and lace patterns with periods a multiple of the document size.  Two curves drawn with the extension may be selected and have a third curve drawn such that it is bounded by the first two curves.  In short, the extension is intended for generating some fun patterns for drawing on eggs."
