function = "Ever need a maze generated for OpenSCAD?  If so, then this puppy is for you.  It is a Python script which generates a random N x M maze and outputs a 3D description of it as an OpenSCAD program.\r\n\r\nThe number of maze cells as well as the maze's physical size can all be controlled with command line arguments when running the Python script.  The Python code can even be modified to generated non-rectangular mazes.  (Hint: just throw up non-removable walls in the initialized maze data.)\r\n\r\nBTW, the Python code here is derived from the Eggbot Maze generator, Eggmazing, which is distributed with the Eggbot software and is an Inkscape extension.  I wrote that extension for the Eggbot in the Fall of 2010 and want to again thank W. Craig Trader for the assistance he provided with that effort.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n9 June 2012: Corrected invalid commenting style in line 1 of OpenSCAD output\r\n9 June 2012: Added warning when wall thickness (-t) is explicitly set to be thicker than one-half the cell's width or length."
