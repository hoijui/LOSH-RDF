\r
And, it would be REALLY COOL to mod this somehow for dualstrusion to produce AWESOME contour plots.  For example, print every fifth layer in a contrasting color.  The one in the photo was done manually using the Jetty Firmware's "Pause at Z-height" and changing out the filament in a single extruder.\r
\r
At any rate, be the first carbon-based life unit on your block with a Lego(tm) set which includes\r
\r
z(x,y) = cos(sqrt(x^2+y^2))/(1+x^2+y^2)\r
 \r
Or, print your own doll house washboard with\r
\r
z(x,y) = cos(|x|+|y|).""" ;
