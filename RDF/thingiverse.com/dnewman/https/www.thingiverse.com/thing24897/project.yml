function: "Could there be anything more fun than drawing 3D surface plots? Yes, you can 3D print 3D surface plots and hold them in your own hands!  (Indeed, I wrote this OpenSCAD program in 2011 for a math teacher who wanted some tangible 3D plots for a blind student.)\r\n\r\nAnd, it would be REALLY COOL to mod this somehow for dualstrusion to produce AWESOME contour plots.  For example, print every fifth layer in a contrasting color.  The one in the photo was done manually using the Jetty Firmware's \"Pause at Z-height\" and changing out the filament in a single extruder.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, be the first carbon-based life unit on your block with a Lego(tm) set which includes\r\n\r\nz(x,y) = cos(sqrt(x^2+y^2))/(1+x^2+y^2)\r\n \r\nOr, print your own doll house washboard with\r\n\r\nz(x,y) = cos(|x|+|y|)."
