Orchids further benefit from pots with lots of holes around the pot's side.  Unfortunately, most of the commercial orchid pots with such holes are medium to large in size (120mm in diameter on up).  Hence this design which can be used to make small, highly aerated orchid pots.\r

The supplied OpenSCAD file is fully parameterized allowing for the size of the pot and the number of circumferential holes to be adjusted.""" ;
