___This is version 6 of Thing #24808___  \r
Libre Graphics World has a nice write up by Alexandre Prokoudine of this extension at http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/inkscape-gets-openscad-converter   \r
This Thing is an Inkscape extension to export Inkscape paths to OpenSCAD.  There has been at least one prior Thing attempting this, Thing #9376.  However, it only handled a small subset of SVG.  This extension handles SVG arcs, clones, circles, ellipses, groups, lines, paths, polygons, polylines, rects, and splines.  It also follows document transforms as well as viewports. Either an entire document or just the selected portions of a document are processed.  \r
SVG text must first be converted to a path within Inkscape using Inkscape's "Path > Object to Path" menu item.  \r
Note that another approach to importing SVG into OpenSCAD is to save the SVG to DXF from within Inkscape.  Then use OpenSCAD's import() function to import the DXF.  [Older versions of OpenSCAD used import_dxf().]  \r
Much of the core code in this extension is derived from work done by myself and others while developing the Inkscape driver for the Eggbot.  \r
___15 June 2012:___ Added support for a single level of polygon nesting.  I.e., subtract from a polygon the polygons contained within it AND from the same Inkscape path.   This works well for most fonts.  You can tell Inkscape to combine multiple polygons into a single path by selecting the polygons and then using "Path > Combine".  (You do not need to do this for text converted to a path: Inkscape already does the proper combining.)  \r
___15 June 2012:___ Corrected Windows issue with handling of Unix-style file paths.  \r
___21 June 2012:___ Correct a typo in the extension.  Would not affect content generated by Inkscape but might have affected SVG content generated elsewhere and loaded into Inkscape.  \r
___9 May 2013:___ Modified the code to remove non alphanumeric characters from the strings used to generate the OpenSCAD module names.  Some SVG paths had non alphanumeric characters in their path ids and those ids were being used to generate OpenSCAD module names.  OpenSCAD doesn't allow that.  \r
___29 May 2013:___ Corrected an issue whereby the converted could exit with an error when attempting to warn about images embedded in the SVG file or Inkscape drawing.  Images are not allowed and the converter cannot convert them.  However, it should gracefully warn about the issue and exit normally.  \r
___30 May 2013:___ Fixed a bug in the v4 version.  \r
___16 Aug 2013:___ Possible workaround to Inkscape bug experienced by some users, "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error' what(): basic_string::_S_construct null not valid\"""" ;
