function: "Hocus Pocus! You present your audience with six colored blocks, each one with a hole through its face.  Your audience inspects the blocks as well as the box you will place them in and the pin you will pierce them with.  A volunteer selects two of the six blocks.  After placing all six blocks into the box,  you pierce the box and all the blocks with a pin.  Waving your hand over the box, you say a magic word.  Turning the box upside down, the lid falls off and out drops the two chosen blocks!  But wait the pin is still running through the box with the remaining blocks still pinned in place!\r\n\r\nSee the demo video http://youtu.be/pmZhGH7pSUo\r\n\r\nPrint this magic trick along with Thing 24719,\r\n\r\n  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24719\r\n\r\nand put on an impromptu magic show!  You'll be sure to amaze your friends and family."
