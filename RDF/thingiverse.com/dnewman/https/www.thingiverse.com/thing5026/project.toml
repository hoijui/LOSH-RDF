function = "I rendered Matt's artwork on an egg using an Eggbot. This required resizing the original artwork in Inkscape. To make the egg drawing appear more similar to Matt's original, I further stretched the drawing horizontally with the amount of stretch given by the secant of the latitude. (I.e., it's stretched more and more as you approach the egg's poles.)"
