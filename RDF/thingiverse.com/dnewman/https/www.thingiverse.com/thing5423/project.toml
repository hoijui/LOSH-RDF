function = "More Eggbot plots.  pattern2-767.svg is the nicest of the three.  It was generated to be 1125 pixels high and then vertically shrunk to 66.667% of its original height.  That then gives an egg-suitable aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nThe other two plots, pattern2-800.svg and pattern2-1000.svg are, respectively, 800 and 1000 pixels high.  They are more appropriate for plotting on spheres as they have 1:1 aspect ratios.  The supplied Python program generates the 800 pixel high variant.  Change the HEIGHT variable setting for a 1000 pixel high plot."
