function = "This is a four color geometric pattern for plotting on eggs with the Eggbot.  The SVG drawing has a height of 800 pixels and has an aspect ratio appropriate for plotting on eggs.  To adjust for plotting on spheres, rescale the vertical size to a height of 1200 pixels.  Then remove rows so as to obtain the desired vertical height (e.g., 1000 pixels).\r\n\r\nPlotting this drawing successfully requires a high degree of plotting accuracy (e.g., to prevent unwanted registration problems).  So, be sure to carefully load your egg with the correct tension. \r\n\r\nThe included Python file is the Python code to generate the basic drawing with dimensions 1200 x 3200.  In Inkscape, I then rescaled the vertical dimension by 63.333% so as to get an aspect ratio suitable for drawing on eggs.  (66.666% might seem more apropos, but I wanted to be a tad shorter than 800 pixels and hence 63.3333%)"
