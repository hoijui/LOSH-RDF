function = "This is a monochrome geometric drawing for plotting on eggs with the Eggbot.  The drawing is 800 x 3200 and has an aspect ratio appropriate for eggs.  To plot on spheres, rescale the image vertically to a height of 1200 pixels and then remove rows to obtain the desired height (e.g., 1000 pixels).\r\n\r\nDrawing this plot requires a high degree of plotting precision.  You can remove a column to  prevent any poor seams from appearing and still have a pleasant plot.\r\n\r\nFWIW, at a pen speed of around 220 steps/second, this plot takes about 30 minutes to draw.  I've had success drawing it at faster speeds (300 s/s); however, with the pens I use, I like the slower speeds for achieving better color saturation."
