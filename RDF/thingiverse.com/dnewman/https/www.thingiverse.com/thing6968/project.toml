function = "Another geometric tiling for the Eggbot.  This one somewhat reminiscent of Op Art.   This drawing is in a 3200 by 800 pixel template.\r\n\r\nGenerating this and similar images is fairly simple.  For example, this image was generated by drawing an isosceles triangle.  Then it was \"twisted\" using the contributed \"twist\" extension under Extensions > Eggbot Contributed.  The result of twisting was then cloned & tiled using Inkscape's Edit > Clone > Create Tiled Clones... tool."
