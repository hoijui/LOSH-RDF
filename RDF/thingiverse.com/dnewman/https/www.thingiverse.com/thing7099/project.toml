function = "And another geometric tiling for the Eggbot. This one somewhat reminiscent of Op Art. The drawing is in a 3200 by 800 pixel template.\r\n\r\nGenerating this and similar images is fairly simple. For example, this image was generated by drawing a square, then splitting the square into two triangles.  Each triangle was then twisted using the contributed \"twist\" extension under Extensions > Eggbot Contributed. The result was then cloned & tiled using Inkscape's Edit > Clone > Create Tiled Clones... tool.\r\n\r\nSee also Thing 6968."
