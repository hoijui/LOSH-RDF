Then this drawing is just what you've been looking for! \r\n\r\nThis is a 3200 x 800 pixel plot intended for plotting with the Eggbot.\r\n\r\nP.S. The text was rendered using the new Hershey Text extension by Windell Oskay and distributed with the latest Eggbot software release.  It may be found in Inkscape under Extensions > Render > Hershey Text (after you update to the latest Eggbot software).  The utility of that extension is not limited to just the Eggbot.  Among other things, it provides nice, non-filled, single stroke fonts ideal for use in CNC and CNC-related applications."
