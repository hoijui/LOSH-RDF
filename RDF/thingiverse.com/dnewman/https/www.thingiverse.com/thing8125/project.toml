function = "...or \"omelette\" if you prefer.\r\n\r\nThese files are for plotting an omelet recipe on eggs using an Eggbot.  Use the file omelet.svg or omelet-1-serving.svg if you park the \"pointy\" end of your eggs at the egg motor cup.  Use omelet-flipped.svg or omelet-1-serving-flipped.svg if, like me, you park the fat end of your eggs at the egg motor's egg cup.  (Less slippage when you do that, eh?)\r\n\r\nNote that the text is sized such that you don't need a nano sized pen tip: I used a Sharpie Ultra Fine for the pictured egg.\r\n\r\nSo how many servings for omelet.svg and omelet-flipped.svg?  Those two files have a \"2 serving\" recipe which calls for two eggs.  If you desire a more self-contained recipe, then go with the \"1 serving\" variants.  And, if you need nutrition info, well just see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7232 and then mentally add in the 2 or 1 Tbsp of cream and 3/4 or 1/2 Tbsp of butter.  (Butter is about 100 calories per Tbsp and there's about 50 calories per Tbsp for heavy cream [the yummy stuff].)\r\n\r\nBon appetit!"
