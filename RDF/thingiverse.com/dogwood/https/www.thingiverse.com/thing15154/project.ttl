\r
Thinking that a adjustable pressure and a free wheeling follower would work better I printed out the http://www.thingiverse.com/14468 Shaputer modified version of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7113 Yet another extruder filament drive by Jag\r
\r
Definitely a step in the right direction, but now instead of stripping the filament would fatigue and start wrapping around the driver.\r
\r
In the comments on Jag's drive someone mentioned they thought the 1.75mm filament was just too weak, which it is, what it needs is more support, so I modified Jag's driver to move the plastic up as close to the driver as I could and still get good pressure on the filament.\r
\r
Here's the results, I'm just finishing a print of the Snow Flake as I type this, I wasn't even able to get half way through before even with the Jag drive.\r
\r
I also made the nut slots a big bigger to try and save some time.""" ;
