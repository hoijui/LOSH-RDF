function = "This is a printable linear slide rail for Pandelume's printable Unicorn Pen Plotter www.thingiverse.com/thing:4200. The rail takes advantage of the smooth bottom surfaces of things printed on a heated build platform. the smooth surfaces allow the slide and rail to slide easily without catching on any ridges. These pieces were printed using a MK5 plastruder and heated platform with stock MakerBot unsanded kapton. I have no idea if this will work on sanded/taped platforms.\r\n\r\nSTL and SolidWorks 2010 model files are included."
