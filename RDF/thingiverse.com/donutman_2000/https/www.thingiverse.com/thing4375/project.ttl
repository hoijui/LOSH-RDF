    okh:function """Okay so it isn't really a cube, but that doesn't make it any less awesome. This nifty little thing was created by Kris Pister at UCLA and basically tells you everything you ever wanted to know about silicon (from a microfabrication standpoint) i.e. different crystal planes, etch rates in various solutions, crystal structure, etc. The original is made out of paper and meant to be glued or taped together, but after an unfortunate incident involving a falling textbook I have discovered that it is not very robust this way. \r
\r
On the off chance that you don't actually care about silicon but want to print it anyway, it makes a nice Christmas tree ornament!\r
\r
I've included a hollow box version with a lid, a braced box version, and a full-blown solid version, depending on how much plastic you want to use.\r
\r
Update: I uploaded a letter-sized version of SiCube.pdf (the cube itself is still the same size). I also uploaded new pictures since I totally made the first one wrong =(.""" ;
