function = "This bracket mounts your flash unit to a standard 1/4\" tripod for wireless lighting applications. This was designed to fit a Metz 50 AF-1 flash, but should also fit other units that have a standard hot shoe mount. This is useful if you have a flash unit that can be triggered as a wireless slave using your camera's built-in flash, or if you use wireless triggers and mount your flash to the receiver, and the receiver to the bracket.  \n\n\n\nAlso functions as a protective cover for your flash's electrical contacts."
