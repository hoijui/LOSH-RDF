function: "This is a mash-up of the spindle from \"Heavy duty filament spool - for mendel by watsdesign\" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11447) and  \"Snap-In Mendel Filament Guide, with diagonal slot by toomanyplugs\" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11521)\r\n\r\nI needed a filament guide after printing the heavy duty spool, I seemed to me that I would be even better if the parts were combined.\r\n\r\nSince both source files were in different formats I combined the stl's in openSCAD. The edges may be a little rough where I had to clean off the protruding edges."
