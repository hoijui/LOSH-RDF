function = "This thing is a bar clamp for the Orca 0.3 (0.4?) or any other application where you need to fix a bar to a plate.\r\n\r\nI drew this as it seems to be the only printed part for the Orca that I cannot find an STL for. However the SCAD file is fully parametric so I sure there are lots of applications for such a part.\r\n\r\nThe SCAD file is configure to scale the part based on your print setting. (0.45mm layer height would seem optimal)\r\n\r\n**V2 of the SCAD file improves the form with musch bigger sizes"
