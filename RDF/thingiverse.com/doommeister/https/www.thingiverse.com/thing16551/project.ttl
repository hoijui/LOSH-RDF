\r
I drew this as it seems to be the only printed part for the Orca that I cannot find an STL for. However the SCAD file is fully parametric so I sure there are lots of applications for such a part.\r
\r
The SCAD file is configure to scale the part based on your print setting. (0.45mm layer height would seem optimal)\r
\r
**V2 of the SCAD file improves the form with musch bigger sizes""" ;
