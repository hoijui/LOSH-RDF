function = "Simple SCAD script that generates a duct plate & length of duct for mounting to a small DC fan (25mm - 120mm).\r\n\r\nYou can generate square, conical, or round ducts.\r\n\r\nI tried to make the design printable without support although you must be carefull if using the cone setting not to make an unprintable overhang.\r\n\r\nI have included 4 sample STL outputs but you will have to generate your own to suit.\r\n\r\nIve not made this a library style file (yet)."
