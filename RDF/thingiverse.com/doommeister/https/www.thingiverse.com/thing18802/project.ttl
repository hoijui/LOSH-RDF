Pipe with an incorporated fitting\r
90Â° elbow\r
Equal T\r

N Way manifold\r
Blanking cap\r
Single reduction\r

With either solvent weld type ends or a clamp type end.\r

This a first iteration work in progress that may well be expanded and defiantly needs the code re factoring. I am doubtful that any of the fittings will print without support material but this is becoming much less of an issue.\r
\r
One interesting use outside of the obvious that occurred to me was for some one with more l33t SCAD skills than me to use anumation features of SCAD to make a version of the old windows pipes screen saver. Now that would be cool.\r
