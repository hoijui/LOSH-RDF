function: "This is an OpenSCAD library to generate round ducting / pipe, and assosated fittings. The file will generate\r\n\r\nPipe\r\nPipe with an incorporated fitting\r\n90\xC2\xB0 elbow\r\nEqual T\r\n4 Way T\r\nN Way manifold\r\nBlanking cap\r\nSingle reduction\r\nN Way T\r\n\r\nWith either solvent weld type ends or a clamp type end.\r\n\r\nThis a first iteration work in progress that may well be expanded and defiantly needs the code re factoring. I am doubtful that any of the fittings will print without support material but this is becoming much less of an issue.\r\n\r\nOne interesting use outside of the obvious that occurred to me was for some one with more l33t SCAD skills than me to use anumation features of SCAD to make a version of the old windows pipes screen saver. Now that would be cool.\r\n\r\n**\r\nWARNING - No warranty is given regarding the fitness of these parts to convey pressurised \r\nmedia if they are fabricated by any means. The user takes all risk in terms of safety and material choice. \r\n**"
