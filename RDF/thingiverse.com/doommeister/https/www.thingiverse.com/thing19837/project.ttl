    okh:function """V3/4 cuts some unneeded material out to save a little weight/plastic/print time, it also addes the option to print a pair of holders so you can use extruders other than the MP V9/10 (Gregs Wade for instance)(note - This will only work with groove mount or other hot ends that don't require the 30mm retaining strap).\r
\r
 V2 adds some chamfers and a retained nut for the belt clamp so the pillar does not foul on the Z lead screws\r
\r
Yet another X Carriage for the Orca V0.3. This one is fully agnostic as to what type of timing belt you use as the belt is retained by straps.\r
\r
This design uses 3 of my LM8UU bearing carries and 2 of the straps from my Y belt tensioner. The extruder base and the bearing carriers are all retained by captured nylock nuts.\r
\r
The advantages of this design (I think) are\r
Use any type of timing belt (small enough)\r
Belt clamp is a simple design\r
Belt is attached to the double bearing side\r
The extruder motor is placed to the back (assuming like me you want all the other motors at the front) \r
You do not loose any Z height, by adjusting the car_thickness parameter in the SCAD file you can gain Z height""" ;
