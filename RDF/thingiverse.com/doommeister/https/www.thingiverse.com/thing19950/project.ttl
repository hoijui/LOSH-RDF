\r
This is a complete set of printed parts to convert your Orca V0.3 to use LM8UU linear ball bearings. The set includes bearing holders for the X, Y and Z axis's, new Y axis bar clamps so you can gain a little (approx 8mm) Z axis height, Y axis belt clamps, X carriage, and end stop holders for Hall O end stops. I would also highly recommend replacing the MP v9/10 extruder with a Wades derivative (I am using the emaker/Reprap Pro one).\r
\r
Where ever possible the idea is to clamp the side of the LM8UU against the aluminium plates thus removing as much of the tolerance of the printed parts as possible. I have also shaved as much as possible of the Z stack so the Z print height should be up to 175-180mm (depending on the length of your hot end).\r
\r
The SCAD file is parametric to some degree.\r
\r
 v7 adds anti backlash (spring loaded) Z nut holders.\r
\r
v8 adds an extra nut to the abl Z nut holders (takes out some slop) and a 5th axis bar clamp. This is needed to drop a short length of M8 studding to hold the Z end stop. The X carriage now compiles properly in the SCAD file to generate a full plate (but requires the SCAD source to do so).""" ;
