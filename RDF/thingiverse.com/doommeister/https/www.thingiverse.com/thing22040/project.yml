function: "Anti back lash Z nut holders for the Orca v0.3. The STL is sized to suit an ORCA with LM8UU linear bearings, the SCAD file can be modified to suit any offset from the Y carriage though. \r\n\r\nV6/7 was inspired by the lead screw holders on the Emaker/Reprappro Huxley.(The stl has been deleted but you can generate it from the SCAD file if you want this part)\r\n\r\nV8 adds another nut as depending on the compression of the spring this part can introduce some slop in the Z axis (as the spring compresses the Y axis carrier can move up and down).\r\n\r\n user Barrychuck http://www.thingiverse.com/barrychuck PM'd me to say that a second nut was required for the anti-backlash, I would disagree as the sping itself removes the backlash by keeping a single face of the threads engaged as lead-screw reverses. The point is moot however as the original design can be subject to some sloppiness and 2 are better if your spring is not strong enough"
