function = "This is a simple spool spindle to mount a printed filament spool on an Orca 0.3 3D printer, I am not sure if it will work (without drilling) for any later variants of the Orca printer. Of coarse the part will work with any flat surface, printer side, wall etc if you are willing to drill 2 3.5mm holes at 20mm (19.8) spacing.\r\n\r\nThe spindle is for use with Heavy duty printable filament spool(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10219)by Rotoscan and any of its derivatives of which there are may.\r\n\r\nI have uploaded the SCAD source but it will not be that usefull as it not parametric and just modifies the spindle from Watsdesign's  Heavy duty filament spool - for mendel\r\n(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11447)"
