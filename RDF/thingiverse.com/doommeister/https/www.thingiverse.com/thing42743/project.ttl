    okh:function """I am currently making some new X ends for my Sells Mendel using trapezoidal threaded lead screws, I have made the nuts for myself in a traditional fashion by machining and tapping the threads. However I started thinking about if the nuts could be printed, turns out they can but I always have trouble cleaning the threads. This is no problem if you have a tap but trapezoidal taps are expensive.\r
\r
This thing is intended to suggest a method that you can produce your own Ghetto reamers to clean out printed threads.\r
\r
I am marking it work in progress as I have not tried this, disregard the .stl as this is not a printed object (print it if you want to/can though).\r
\r
Bear in mind that most threaded rod is soft, you could not fabricate a tap this way. This is only going to be suitable for finishing plastic parts.""" ;
