function = "Here is a design for a printable lead screw nut for use the Trapizoidal threads, the examples given are in TR10 x2. The STL's are generated from an Alibre Design Model, but I have re-made it in OpenSCAD using Syvwlch's thread library. I have also included a holder for nuts which you can use in your own designs.\r\n\r\nI initialy machined the nuts from Delrin but printed them just for the heck of it and on inspection I think they will be quite functional. You want the nuts to be the wear piece and not the threaded rod which is what seams to happen on my machines where I use a metal lead-screw nut."
