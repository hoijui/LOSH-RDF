function = "A construction kit similar to MeccanoÂ® but fully customisable and printable. Choose which bit you want, how big, how big your bolts are, tweak and print. If your a rep-rapper use all your left over M3 cap screws and all thread to build something awesome.  \n\nYou can print, flat plates, circle plates, L beams, angle beams and pulleys. I hope to add in time a bearing holder, and some self sizing gears.  \n\nAdd your own hardware to finish off.  \n\nv 1.01 - Hole size is now free entry so you can enter the metric equivilent of an SAE size, or use 10mm bolts if you choose."
