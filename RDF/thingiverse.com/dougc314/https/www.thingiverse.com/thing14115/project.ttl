    okh:function "This is a multimeter stand for a specific sized meter made by Cen-Tech and market by a large tool discounter. Width is 70 mm and thickness is 23mm. Length is non critical. I printed several first generation designs (not released) and have printed the one second generation shown here. The difference being all the holes to reduce plastic. The others I have printed have held up well to months of use in our lab at work. Included is the Alibre source and a step export as well as the stl." ;
