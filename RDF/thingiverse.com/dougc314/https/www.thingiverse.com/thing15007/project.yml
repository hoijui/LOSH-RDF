function: "This is a handle for holding the Fire while you read, watch, browse, etc. I bought my family (and myself) Fires for Christmas, and mine came early!. I quickly realized that its heavy enough that its hard to hold while using it for any length of time, without a handle. I designed this handle, and shortly after unwrapping the Fires I passed out the handles that I had printed last week. It gets rave reviews.\r\n\r\nThe feedback I get is that both the knob and the handle are useful, I was thinking perhaps only one is necessary. My prototype only has the handle, and I missed having an easier way to hold it in landscape position, so I added the knob to the subsequent prints.\r\n\r\nThe stls are the ones I printed, and I have included the design files, in native Alibre and as STEP files in the ZIP."
