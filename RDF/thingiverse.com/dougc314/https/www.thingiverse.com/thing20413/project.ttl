    okh:function "This is a modification to jonaskuehling's version of the famous Gregs Wade Extruder. I am participating in a 18 unit Prusa group build (using TOMs primarily to print the parts!) We wanted this version, but need both 3 mm and 1.75 versions. I noted as others that the filament path wasn't completly parameterized and that the guidler moves in Z. I believe I have solved the issue, you can read my comments, any code changed by me has a //DEC comment. I have printed a 1.75 mm version, and it seems correct. I also mover the guidler so that the three parts (body, washer and guidler) fits on a 100mm square build platform" ;
