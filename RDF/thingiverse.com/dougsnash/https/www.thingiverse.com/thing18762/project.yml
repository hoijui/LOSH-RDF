function: "These files are a breakdown of the larger parts from the MakerBot Clock, Thing 8214 (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18214)\r\n\r\nThe large parts of the clock have been broken down into sizes appropriate for printing on a ToM.  The smaller parts required to complete the clock will need to be sourced from the original clock page.     Please note that I have not finished printing these parts so modifications may be necessary to make them work with the original clock parts.   I have run these parts through NetFabb but there may still be a few issues.  Let me know if you find anything that does not work.\r\n\r\n Note: A hardware kit will be required to build the clock. The hardware kit is/was available from MakerBot as a limited edition.  While the $50.00 might seem a bit steep for the parts, the kit includes several small bearings which add significantly to the price."
