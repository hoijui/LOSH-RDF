function = "This is a snack dispenser perfect for peanuts or m&m's. A jar full of your favorite snack sits upside down on top of the dispenser body.  Hold your hand below the hole and turn the knob to receive your snack. \r\n\r\nThis design is based on a wooden version that belonged to my grandparents.\r\n\r\n12/28/2016 update:  I have never printed this, but now that I have a good printer, I will be printing it and modifying parts to fit properly, if needed."
