function: "I modified the dimensions to use 3mm Acrylic so it could be cheaper and faster to cut. I wanted to modify it so people could use hacker spaces and places like techshop laser cutters. Even at 40W you can still cut this in a single pass.  \n\nIf you don't have access to a laser cutter let me know and we can work something out."
