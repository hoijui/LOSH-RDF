function = "Along the same line as my Replicator hood kit I've now made a ToM version. This helps keep the heat in and prevent drafts from messing up your prints. It has a long gap down the center to allow air to escape and allow filament in and out. I also set the height to 6\" which is plenty of room no matter what extruder your rocking on your ToM.   \n\n\n\nOn the hood you will notice a 1\" square hole in each corner. These are there for anything you may want to add. For example a filament brush or guide.  \n\nIf you don't have access to a laser cutter let me know and we can work something out."
