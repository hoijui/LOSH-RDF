function = "I adapted stickoutrock's Crosslink Ellipse Gears to be printable on a 3D printer. It's similar to natetrue's version ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1538 ), but I created a completely new design in OpenSCAD, which uses a different type of joint, which should be more robust. The joints also do not stick out of the holes in the ellipse gear, avoiding the gears to get stuck during the rotation.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of this thing: http://vimeo.com/18244936"
