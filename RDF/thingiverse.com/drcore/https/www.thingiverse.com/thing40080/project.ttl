    okh:function """Preliminary design for a standrad Mendel Prusa printer. Design goals:\r
* Combine printer, PSU, RAMPS controller and LCD+keypad into on box.\r
* Allow printer to be easily put in and out of box (top bar can be unscrewed to allow printer to be taken out/in).\r
* High visibility on printing process (plexiglass windows surrounding machine).\r
* Easy access to print platform and end-stops (hinged flap on front, semi-attached flap on the back.\r
* As air tight as possible to keep toxic ABS fumes enclosed and stabilize temperature control.\r
* Don't use toxic air to cool PSU and controller.\r
* Integrate spindle holder on machine (with multi-extruder/spindles as option.\r
\r
Design was done keeping in mind standard wood pieces and plexiglass. FreeCAD is used to make the design.""" ;
