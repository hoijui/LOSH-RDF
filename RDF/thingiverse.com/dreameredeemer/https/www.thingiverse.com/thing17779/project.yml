function: "Update: it turned out this didn't actually work. What finally fixed the problem (only just recently!) was running the steppers with 24V, which also enabled them to run at their specified current (and more quietly/better sounding). I probably also significantly reduced voltage fluctuations in the process.  \n\nMy bot has had a real problem with the filament drive wheel slipping for a long time now, which would occasionally result in stripping, especially on long prints, and thus lots of frustration and wasted plastic. Jag's filament drive proved to have less slipping, but there was still too much. Fortunately his design has the advantage of being uncovered, so that some airflow can reach the filament and the drive components and escape from the other side. Thus it was a simple matter to print a mount for a small fan that could push air across the drive. This has almost completely eliminated slippage (huzzah!)."
