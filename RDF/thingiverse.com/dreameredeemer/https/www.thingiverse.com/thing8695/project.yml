function: Yet Another Spool. This was designed to leverage readily available and cheap materials in addition to 3D printabliciousness. In all likelihood this could be done with less plastic, shorter print times, etc. but as soon as I had a functioning spool for this 5 lbs. of PLA, it ceased to occupy any of my attention. In fact, I've been meaning to UL for a few weeks now, but have instead been not doing that. I had even thought of a few things which would qualify as fine tuning, but then I forgot most of them and ceased caring; what I could remember is now in the instructions, left as a challenge for You, my exceptional reader.
