function: Someone needed a mount for a Bell light, so I threw this together. The seatpost clamp design was borrowed from the typical reflector mount and could also be used for other stuff... like reflectors. The light mount can also be generated from the scad file with a tab to make it removable with those wedge tension clip things.
