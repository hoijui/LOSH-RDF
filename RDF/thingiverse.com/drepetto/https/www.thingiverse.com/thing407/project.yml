function: "This is a knockoff lasercutter version of:\r\n\r\nhttp://evilmadscience.com/partsmenu/68-bender\r\n\r\nWindell H. Oskay from Evil Mad Science and Zach 'Hoeken' Smith helped work out the laser cutter design on the thingiverse mailing list. \r\n\r\nThis is just a first try. I cut one in 3/16\" plywood and it's usable, but not ideal. It's clearly going to break soon. The biggest problem is the thinness of some of the walls. In the commercial version there's a recessed channel, rather than a cut out channel as in this design. That gives the tool more strength."
