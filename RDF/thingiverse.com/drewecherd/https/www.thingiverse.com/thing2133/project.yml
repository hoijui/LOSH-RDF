function: Got my school's Makerbot up and running last week and now I'm testing what it can do. I came up with this block of our school's letters, "LRMS." It is a 20mm cube. It pushes the Makerbot's limits on resolution. I also make a 30mm version. The only issues with it really are the "S\" isn't fully supported and the edge of the "R" droops a little too. Overall I'm pleased with the print!
