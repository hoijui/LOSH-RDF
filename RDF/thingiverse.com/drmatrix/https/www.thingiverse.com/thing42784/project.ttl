\r
Built my printer a PrintrBot LC , and found out can't print my object as it is presented, and the sizes are wrong, and has overhangs - all things I am aware of now - \r
\r
-I have uploaded new files RHPT_V2 has the head flipped over to print from the flat head up,  the mouth overhang is gone w/a nice slope for printing without support, and it is re-sized to really fit on a pencil top.  This simple print as taught me a lot,  The OpenSCAD file that prints version 2 is also uploaded""" ;
