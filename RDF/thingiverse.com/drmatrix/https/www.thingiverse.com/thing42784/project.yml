function: "newbie - not have a printer yet but learning - saw the instruction in Make: for TinkerCAD but wanted to learn in OpenSCAD so made one in that for a test - somebody please print - I won't have a printer for another month (or so) \r\n\r\nBuilt my printer a PrintrBot LC , and found out can't print my object as it is presented, and the sizes are wrong, and has overhangs - all things I am aware of now - \r\n\r\n-I have uploaded new files RHPT_V2 has the head flipped over to print from the flat head up,  the mouth overhang is gone w/a nice slope for printing without support, and it is re-sized to really fit on a pencil top.  This simple print as taught me a lot,  The OpenSCAD file that prints version 2 is also uploaded"
