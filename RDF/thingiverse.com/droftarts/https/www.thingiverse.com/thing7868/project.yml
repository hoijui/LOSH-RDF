function: "Firstly, this is NOT MY IDEA! It was published by Vik Olliver, Diamond Age Solutions Ltd. http://diamondage.co.nz. I have reproduced it here, assuming that it is public domain. However, I will be happy to remove it if the original author would like me to. His document says \"Documentation released under the GFDL for free reproduction.\" I hope that extends to his pictures!\r\n\r\nI am building a mrkimrobotics 1X2 reprap http://mrkimrobotics.com/ and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5773 from basic, locally sourced parts, and getting to the point were I need to create a hot end. I realised I needed a lathe for this, but don't have space or cash for a real one and all thingiverse lathes http://www.thingiverse.com/tag:lathe require some reprapped parts - but mine isn't built yet! Somehow I stumbled upon Vik's page and feel it deserves a wider audience.\r\n\r\nI built mine using a Bosch hand drill with handle adapter clamped in a Black and Decker Workmate for one end, and the chuck from my drill press G-clamped to a small vice for the other. I have only been playing around with this so far, and haven't got this working quite well enough yet to make a hot end, but it has excellent potential.\r\n\r\nVik Olliver: \"Why an 'Afghan Lathe'? Because I first saw this kind of technique being used by Afghan gunsmiths to produce counterfeit firearms with remarkable precision.\""
