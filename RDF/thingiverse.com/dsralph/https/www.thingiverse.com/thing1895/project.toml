function = "OK... so this is the very first thing I have come up with.  I noticed that there are no files to make a tank tread.  I am currently working on producing a complete set of tank treads but my extruder has decided to take a dive so I am rebuilding it.  \r\n\r\nIf there are any more files that are needed let me know.  This file was created in Sketchup and then exported to STL.  If you have any input please do what you will!\r\n\r\nThe only next thing that I am working on is a sprocket which will fit to turn the tread as a series!\r\n\r\nThanks!"
