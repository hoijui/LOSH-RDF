function: "So this is a case for the Bus Pirate v3 board from Seeed Studio found at http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/bus-pirate-v3-assembled-p-609.html?cPath=61_68\r\n\r\nv3 is much smaller than then v2 board that is found here.\r\n\r\nMods for the future are better accessibility to visualize the surface mount LEDs\r\n\r\nI also included the Sketchup File that I am using for any modifications.  Hope someone can enjoy it as much as I did.\r\n\r\nThis is a derivative of the following Bus Pirate v2 cases\r\nhttp://dev.thingiverse.com/thing:1716\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2135"
