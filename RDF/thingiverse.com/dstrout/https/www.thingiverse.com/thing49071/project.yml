function: This is derived from mpluma's "Filament spool holder for Prusa Mendel" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:48856 .  I needed a guide that would hang out to the side somewhat to work with my filamant spool, and really like the style of mpluma's spool holder, so I thinned it up from 15mm down to 10mm and closed off the end to keep the filamanet from jumping out.
