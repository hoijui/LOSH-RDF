function: "We made this mount for 2,4,5 & 6 GoPro's to film a 360\xC2\xBA Video Panorama.  \n\nUPDATE: I just uploaded a 6 GoPro spherical mount. You need to print the following   \n\n- newSphericalMount6GoPro.scad  \n- 6thGoPro.scad   \n- spacer100mm.scad  \n\nRequires 2 x M3 Bolts and 1x HEX bolt 1/4-20 UNC so as to fit with tripod bolt sizes.   \n\nSorry for the lack of documentation... i've put off putting this up for so long and figured it's ok as is :)"
