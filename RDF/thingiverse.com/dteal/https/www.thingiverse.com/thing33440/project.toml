function = "This is just an idea. I don't know how feasible it is, or whether it's worth building or calibrating. In fact, I don't know almost anything about it...\r\n\r\nIt's a somewhat different 3D gantry design based around a tetrahedron. There are three axes, belt-driven or what-have-you, and each is connected by a sarrus linkage to the end platform.\r\n\r\nI like it because it's extremely stable (tetrahedron) and every axis is exactly the same.\r\n\r\nHowever, (1) it needs complex maths, (2) there's a large footprint, and (3) nobody's actually tried it.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"
