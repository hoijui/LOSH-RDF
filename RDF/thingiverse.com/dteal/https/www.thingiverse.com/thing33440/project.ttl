\r
It's a somewhat different 3D gantry design based around a tetrahedron. There are three axes, belt-driven or what-have-you, and each is connected by a sarrus linkage to the end platform.\r
\r
I like it because it's extremely stable (tetrahedron) and every axis is exactly the same.\r
\r
However, (1) it needs complex maths, (2) there's a large footprint, and (3) nobody's actually tried it.\r
\r
Any thoughts?""" ;
