function = "suffering from z axis wobble?\r\n\r\nThis mod allows the Z axis screw to wobble without influencing the position of the nozzle. The Z axis nut is captured in a bracket that is not rigidly coupled to the X end brackets as with the regular Printrbot Plus.\r\n\r\nThis was created because I was having problems with z axis wobble. I saw some one using the Prusa Z Screw Isolator (thing:20147) and decided that there needed to be an equivalent for the printrbot plus. this may also work with the Printrbot LC however i have not been able to test this (if some one has an LC feedback would be apreciated))\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: new stl file to fix one of the parts not slicing properly.\r\nUpdate: new version with parts swapped so if you suffer from retraction issues they happen on the less important side of the print."
