function = "Super-simple, no assembly required, second spool holder for Replicator 2:\r\n\r\n-No frills; it's pretty ugly\r\n-Designed because other spool holders are too long/deep for the space where my Rep2 lives\r\n-No assembly, prints in one piece\r\n-Honey-comb pattern on bottom makes it easier to release from build plate\r\n-UPDATE v2: Changed profile to accommodate spools w/ 35mm opening (e.g. JustPLA)\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad.
