function: This is a one-man submarine that I have designed. It is dry atmosphere which means that you do not need to wear SCUBA gear inside of it. It incorporates a single center ballast tank, twin air tanks for breathing and buoyancy compensation, rudder controls for pitch/yaw, etc. It is propelled by twin contra-rotational, coaxial propellers driven by conventional bicycle pedals.
