function = "Light up the inside of your Makerbot Thing-O-Matic!  This mounting bracket supports an LED module that was originally designed to be used as a replacement for halogen (12VDC) lamps.  The screw holes on the brackets match the hole spacing of the \"unused / extra\" rod support on the top front of the Thing-O-Matic.  Inset nuts allow easy installation.  You don't even need to make holes in your Thing-O-Matic!"
