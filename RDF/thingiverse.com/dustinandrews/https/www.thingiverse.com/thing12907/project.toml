function = "My first variation got in the way of the ABP unless positioned just right. I kept looking at the front rod covers thinking they would be a good place to put the basket hooks. This thing replaces the two square covers on the front of the makerbot and adds arms to them.\r\n\r\nSomeone really needs to change my utilitarian supports into 3d hands!\r\n\r\nThe one on the left is the current design. The one on the right was a prototype and I think the arms are too skinny.\r\n\r\nThe included scad file has the cover plate as a module if you just want one of those."
