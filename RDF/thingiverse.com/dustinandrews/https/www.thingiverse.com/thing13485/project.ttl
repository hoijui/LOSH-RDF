\r
This is a re-designed set of train wheels for the toy train set. They are basically the same, but designed in Openscad and put on a plate for making 4 wheels at once. At 100% infill I like the way they print better than the originals.\r
\r
The Scad file isn't parametric, but it's really short so it should be easy to modify the wheels if you want. The uploaded version has some taper from bottom to top of the wheel to make them come out better raftless.""" ;
