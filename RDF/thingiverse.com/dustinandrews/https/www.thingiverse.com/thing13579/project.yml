function: "I printed a locomotive for my nephew when he turned two. His 4.5 year old sister asked what I brought for her. I told her that she was old enough to design her own toys if she wanted. She enthusiastically set to work with markers and scissors. Once we scanned the drawings into the computer I traced the drawings by hand in Inkscape and rendered them from DXF in openscad.\r\n\r\nSorry I didn't get a photo of the finished toys. When asked if she liked how they turned out she said \"I love them.\""
