function: "As RepRap has evolved it has acquired many tools and capabilities which have been developed and refined.\r\n\r\nMostly this has been concentrated around plastic extrusion but tools exist for paste, metal, ink etc \r\n\r\nThe next logical step in it's evolution would be to combine these capabilities to unlock further potential.  \r\n\r\nWork is already ongoing on lots of multiple extruder designs on a single carriage. This is one potential solution. \r\n\r\nHowever I propose a Tool Changer!\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress and I will add more info as and when I get time.\r\n\r\n**First test of head changing\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/-p9uMt9foKE\r\n\r\n**NEW Update nearly time to press print\r\n\r\nClose up of new extruder design and x carriage with sprung electrical connections.\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/2qtQg9IiP5Q"
