function = "I needed a way to attach a piece of glass (4mm thick in my case) the same xy dimensions (225mm x 225mm) as my platform below it (mdf) without cutting holes into the glass.\r\n\r\nThese are holders to do such a thing.\r\n\r\nThere are spots for m3 screws to level into and the glass slides into the sliders, with smaller m3 screws to secure it tight.\r\n\r\nStl files may be useful if you have pretty much the same setup with a 4mm glass and the same screw size. If not, you can use the scad files to edit."
