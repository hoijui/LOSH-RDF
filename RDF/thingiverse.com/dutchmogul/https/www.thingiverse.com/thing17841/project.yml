function: "Utilized by specialized technicians known colloquially as \"Doormen,\" the mysterious Omnishpheres allow travel between branes, the occupants hopping from one sphere to another. Affixed in multiple universes at the same time long ago by an advanced, long-extinct species, the Omnispheres are immutable and can neither be destroyed nor moved from their coordinates.\r\n\r\nThis model is scaled to be compatible with 15mm (1/100) miniatures."
