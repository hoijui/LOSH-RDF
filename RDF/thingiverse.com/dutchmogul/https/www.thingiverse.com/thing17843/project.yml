function: "A sentient, self-replicating species of artificial life, the robots known as the Servitors have been in Nexus City for time immemorial. It is speculated that they were built to maintain the city works, though even the oldest Servitor has no memory of the time before the Ascendance, the event that elevated the Servitors to sentience.\r\n\r\nThis model is scaled for use with 15mm miniatures and is approximately 35mm tall."
