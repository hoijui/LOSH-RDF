function = "Kind of a retro dieselpunk/raygun gothic robot, derivation of my \"Metal Pig\" model which can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26399  \n\n\n\nHe's much smaller than Metal Pig, but still fairly large depending on what scale games you play (assuming he'd be for that in the first place). The pics are him alongside some commonly used 15mm and 28mm scale models respectively.   \n\n\n\nNot a lot of changes made to the original model other than the head and scaling, though there;s some minor design alterations.  \n\n\n\nSculpted in Tinkercad.  \n\nhttps://tinkercad.com/things/ijoIF0MROa0-deco-dieselbot-multiverse25mm"
