Dynamic, tactical game play allows for quick resolution as players control treasure-hungry dungeon delvers vying for gold and glory.\r\n\r\nThis game has been designed with Pocket-Tactics in mind and the pieces and rules sets will be able to cross over and expand the depth of each range.\r\n\r\nFor the Pocket-Tactics stuff, head on over here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27257\r\n\r\nAlso, check out our blog for updates on our projects, contests and the like: http://illgottengames.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nAll models designed in the amazing Tinkercad: https://tinkercad.com/users/bHIdLANxoGl"
