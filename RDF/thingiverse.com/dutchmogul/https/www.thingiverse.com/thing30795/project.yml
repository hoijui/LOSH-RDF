function: "When I saw that someone had scanned the bust of Sappho (original here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14565), I figured, what better way to honor the 2,600 year-old poet than to turn her into a corny, towering, fantasy amazon warrior? I really couldn't think of anything else.   \n\n\n\nShe stands about 80mm tall, base is 45mm across. Model was uploaded to TinkerCAD and altered there.  \n\n\n\nhttps://tinkercad.com/things/hLtBtZ4Ccxz-amazon-warrior-sappho"
