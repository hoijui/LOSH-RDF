function: "Happy Holidays everyone!  \n\n\n\nThough I don't generally dabble in seasonal pieces, I figured I'd make a nice and secular ornament. Hang it from whatever takes your fancy! It makes a decent little statue any time of the year too, I suppose. Just clip off the loop at the back of his scarf.  \n\n\n\nThis guy is my one and only entry for the ProtoParadigm December Design contest. Jump on this if you get the chance. There's 3 days left! http://www.protoparadigm.com/blog/2012/12/december-design-contest-win-a-years-of-plastic/  \n\n\n\n-Dedicated to Joyce  \n\n\n\nDesigned in TinkerCAD: https://tinkercad.com/things/hG2ROxQ5iNK-steampunk-owl-ornament"
