function: "Diorama of a scene from a story I'm in the process of writing. Gotta love 3D printing....  \n\n\n\nOh, and for you tabletop enthusiasts, this was all designed in 28mm. The monster is  a little big, but I may reduce its size soon. The Circle-Tech guard however is right on the money. Just make sure you print him raftless, otherwise it might be difficult to assemble him.  \n\n\n\nModels were designed in Sculptris and TinkerCAD."
