function = "NAME: Frank Marcello  ORIGIN: Zuras  OCCUPATION: Private Detective  \n\n\n\nAs a young initiate in the order of Gaâ€™uum, Frank, then known by his birth name, Makaro, came to Nexus City on pilgrimige, a ceremony undertaken by all Agano peoples beholden to the â€œWanderer God.â€x9d During a trip to the Undercity, he and his fellow initiates were assaulted by gangers. Left for dead, Frank climbed out of the Undercity, vowing to take his revenge on the criminal scum that ruled the labyrinthine tunnels below. After changing his name and serving seven years as an officer of  Nexus Security, Frank went into business for himself, opening a small detective firm specializing in gang-related cases. Several gangs have tried to assassinate Frank over the years and, though all attempts have failed, he has sustained numerous injuries and mutilations including a missing finger and a hoarse, raspy voice as a result having his throat cut by a vibro-machete.  \n\n\n\nModel designed in TinkerCAD and Sculptris   \n\n\n\nhttps://tinkercad.com/things/lyUX9LAOLZl-frank-marcello-agano-private-eye-30characterschallenge  \n\n\n\nThis was my 2nd entry for the 30 Characters Challenge. Each day in November I designed and posted a new model. Each character was randomly generated using the Continuum Narrative Engine (an RPG system currently in the works here at the Ill Gotten Games headquarters). I've finally gotten around to converting them to 28mm scale and I'll keep at it, but for now you can see the WIP models here...  \n\n\n\n30characters.com/author/dutch-mogul/"
