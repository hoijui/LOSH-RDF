function = "Famed Trans-Universal adventurer and rationalist, the Professor. Though he appears at first to be a robot, in actuality the Professor is a hyper-intelligent plant in a robotic suit, a lost, living relic of the mysterious Geosian civilization.  \n\n\n\nProps to Dan Pettit for inventing the character. Lots of changes from the original model. Aside from being a lot smaller, his suit has had some more complicated designs implemented and he's been cut up to allow for a much cleaner print and modular positioning of all his bits. The og can be found hither: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26586  \n\n\n\nDesigned in the wonderful TinkerCAD.  \n\n\n\nhttps://tinkercad.com/things/9UehqSRsWnU-the-professor-multiverse28mm"
