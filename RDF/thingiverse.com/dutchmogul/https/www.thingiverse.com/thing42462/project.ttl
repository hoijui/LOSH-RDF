Props to Dan Pettit for inventing the character. Lots of changes from the original model. Aside from being a lot smaller, his suit has had some more complicated designs implemented and he's been cut up to allow for a much cleaner print and modular positioning of all his bits. The og can be found hither: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26586  



Designed in the wonderful TinkerCAD.
