function = "Introducing Pocket-Dungeons! A modular, competitive dungeon-crawl for two to six players.  \r\n\r\nWith modular, tile-based board design and randomized events, no two games will be alike. Dynamic, tactical game play allows for quick resolution as players control treasure-hungry dungeon delvers vying for gold and glory.  \r\n\r\nThis game has been designed with Pocket-Tactics in mind and the pieces and rules sets will be able to cross over and expand the depth of each range.  \r\n\r\nFor the Pocket-Tactics stuff, head on over here: http://www.thingiverse.com/dutchmogul/collections/pocket-tactics-sets  \r\n\r\nAlso, check out our blog for updates on our projects, contests and the like: illgottengames.blogspot.com/  \r\n\r\nAll models were designed in Sculptris and Tinkercad  \r\n\r\nProps to Thingiverse user Foolsgambit for his amazingly utilitarian trays. Don't play Pocket-Dungeons without them! http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:54865"
