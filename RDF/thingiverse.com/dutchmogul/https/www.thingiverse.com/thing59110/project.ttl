    okh:function """Introducing Pocket-Dungeons! A modular, competitive dungeon-crawl for two to six players.  \r
\r
With modular, tile-based board design and randomized events, no two games will be alike. Dynamic, tactical game play allows for quick resolution as players control treasure-hungry dungeon delvers vying for gold and glory.  \r
\r
This game has been designed with Pocket-Tactics in mind and the pieces and rules sets will be able to cross over and expand the depth of each range.  \r
\r
For the Pocket-Tactics stuff, head on over here: http://www.thingiverse.com/dutchmogul/collections/pocket-tactics-sets  \r

All models were designed in Sculptris and Tinkercad  \r

Props to Thingiverse user Foolsgambit for his amazingly utilitarian trays. Don't play Pocket-Dungeons without them! http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:54865""" ;
