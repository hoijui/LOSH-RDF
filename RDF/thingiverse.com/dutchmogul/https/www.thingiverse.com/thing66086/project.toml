Olimyoo in Nexus City are likely escapees from Tartaran enslavement.  \n\nPeaceful creatures by nature, the Olimyoo have the distinction of coming from the planet, Pakinare, a world in a distant universe with a 78% compatibility with Earth biology. It is widely assumed that the Children of Tartarus found this world by means of magical scrying while searching for a new home after their separation from the Galactic Neo-Roman Empire.  \n\nThe language of the Olimyoo is best described as being musical in nature. Olimyoo are incapable of speaking other languages, though may learn and comprehend them.  \n\nOlimyoo concepts by Jeremy Larsen, model designed in Sculptris and TinkerCAD."
