I found that with the original, the idler didn't pull in close enough to create enough pinch for a makerbot MK7 gear on the motor, so I have modified it to make the idler able to pull in closer to the drive gear. I also tightened the tolerance on the recess that holds the shaft for the idler, made it a little stronger on the top bolt mounts for the idler, and fixed the nut traps on the bottom for mounting it to the carriage""" ;
