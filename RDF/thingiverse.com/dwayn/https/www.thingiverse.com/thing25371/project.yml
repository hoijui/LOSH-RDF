function: "wildBill has made changes to the original that make the extruder much better now and it works great with the MK7 gear and the mini hyena\r\n\r\nGo here and get the better version: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24992\r\n\r\n\r\nI found that with the original, the idler didn't pull in close enough to create enough pinch for a makerbot MK7 gear on the motor, so I have modified it to make the idler able to pull in closer to the drive gear. I also tightened the tolerance on the recess that holds the shaft for the idler, made it a little stronger on the top bolt mounts for the idler, and fixed the nut traps on the bottom for mounting it to the carriage"
