    okh:function """So this was be SplitReactionâ€™s first project at Maker Faire 2010 NYC. We wanted to wow the crowd and build something awesome, a project that would inspire kids to become makers and engineers. Also it had to be fun to build so of course the best thing to do was to build a 10 x 10ft Mega Claw Game. \r
\r
A claw game would be challenging since it would have plenty of electrical work, construction and a lot of ideas to present at the fair and for the blog. It would also be tough because we wanted to build it bigger than anything weâ€™ve ever worked on, ten feet by ten feet to be exact.\r
