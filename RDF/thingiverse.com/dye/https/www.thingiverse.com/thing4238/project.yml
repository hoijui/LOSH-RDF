function: "So this was be SplitReaction\xE2\u20AC\u2122s first project at Maker Faire 2010 NYC. We wanted to wow the crowd and build something awesome, a project that would inspire kids to become makers and engineers. Also it had to be fun to build so of course the best thing to do was to build a 10 x 10ft Mega Claw Game. \r\n\r\nA claw game would be challenging since it would have plenty of electrical work, construction and a lot of ideas to present at the fair and for the blog. It would also be tough because we wanted to build it bigger than anything we\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve ever worked on, ten feet by ten feet to be exact.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMaker Faire Editor's Choice New York 2010"
