function = "UPDATE: im working on a new version of this with some improvements in terms of fit that will incorporate all thoughts from this object, corrected measurements and design-refinement\r\n\r\nfor those of you who can't wait (the cad files are ready just not verified by print) please use Aggresives parts in the meantime\r\ni gave them a shot and they made me realice i realy need to improve my version! -> linke to Aggresives Version http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27945\r\n\r\nIf you can wait one or two days check back here, ill post the new part refference here\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are replacement holders for the X and Y (and Z but in my eyes not necessary) axis of the Orca 0.40 and 0.42 Linear Bearings.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks with the LM8UU linear bearings i just couldn't stand the rattling (noise) any more. \r\nI had lubed them several times with grease and with oil none brought improvement.\r\nA good tip was to mount them so that always 2 ball lines run on the smooth rood (45Â° X alignment) but i still had rattling. So i first went for the printed LM8UU which really eased my pain (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16813) .\r\nNext logical step were IGUS slide bearings but they have a different outer diameter an length than the LM8UU so the original holders won't fit.\r\n\r\nThese holders should snap tightly to the RJMP 01-08 bearings and won't fall off during mounting (part that annoyed me on the original LM8UU holders).\r\n\r\nI've been printing with them now for a week and i love them.\r\n\r\nHappy more silent Printing ;)\r\n\r\nUpdate: Here's a video of them in action http://youtu.be/on6PA-QSfIc"
