\r
for those of you who can't wait (the cad files are ready just not verified by print) please use Aggresives parts in the meantime\r
i gave them a shot and they made me realice i realy need to improve my version! -> linke to Aggresives Version http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27945\r
\r
If you can wait one or two days check back here, ill post the new part refference here\r
\r
\r
These are replacement holders for the X and Y (and Z but in my eyes not necessary) axis of the Orca 0.40 and 0.42 Linear Bearings.\r
\r
After a few weeks with the LM8UU linear bearings i just couldn't stand the rattling (noise) any more. \r
I had lubed them several times with grease and with oil none brought improvement.\r
A good tip was to mount them so that always 2 ball lines run on the smooth rood (45Â° X alignment) but i still had rattling. So i first went for the printed LM8UU which really eased my pain (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16813) .\r
Next logical step were IGUS slide bearings but they have a different outer diameter an length than the LM8UU so the original holders won't fit.\r
\r
These holders should snap tightly to the RJMP 01-08 bearings and won't fall off during mounting (part that annoyed me on the original LM8UU holders).\r
\r
I've been printing with them now for a week and i love them.\r
\r
Happy more silent Printing ;)\r
\r
Update: Here's a video of them in action http://youtu.be/on6PA-QSfIc""" ;
