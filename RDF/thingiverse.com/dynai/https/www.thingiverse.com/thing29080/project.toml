I payed a lot of attention when I first assembled my printer, i leveled everything, starting with the desk where i built the machine on it.\r\nBut i allways had problems once everything was assembled or if everything was fine and i had to move my machine i had to start all over again...\r\n\r\nSo while i could bring it down to a point where i could print \"smaller\" parts i recently printed parts that needed the WHOLE printbed-area.\r\nSo i decided to put a finger on my problem which seemed to bee the 2 Y-Axis Guides not beeing 100% parallel, and to adjust this i designed these replacement for the fixed Smooth-Rod holder."
