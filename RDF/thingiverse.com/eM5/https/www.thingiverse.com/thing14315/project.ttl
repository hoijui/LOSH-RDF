I made the Block and Tackle - Pulleys by SteveWall with two variations -- instead of using wooden dowels, I made a second pulleyplate adding the "dowels" to it, making a male/female assembly. I also used a single 3mm x 22 cap screw in the center to fasten it together.   
I've now added the half-sheave as requested.""" ;
