function: "I don't know if this will be of any use to anyone else because it is so specific, but I thought it was an elegant solution and a perfect use for my Makerbot.  \nMy friend asked me for suggestions on a wobbly installation he had done.  \nHis daughter wanted a plastic storage box attached to the back rack of her vintage bike. As a college student in theater, she carries lots of materials back and forth on her bike, and a girlish basket she had just did not cut it.  \nMy friend had attached the box with wire and was not happy with the results.  \nSo I took some measurements and two versions later I had these clips.  \nThey're working well so far, and they look 100% better than the wire solution.  \n***UPDATE*** I was very fond of my solution here but the truth is that it did not work. It appears that the big box on the back of the bicycle was the first thing to hit the ground when the bike was dropped. Or it was used as the place to lean the bike. RESULT: the material could not take the stress so the clips break easily. Oh well! Time to re-work the design."
