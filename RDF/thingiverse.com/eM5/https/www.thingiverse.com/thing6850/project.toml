function = "I got the inspiration for this from Dmatsumoto's thingiverse.com/thing:1637 calibration piece. I was having all kinds of trouble with filled-in pieces, but my Cupcake would make beautiful single strand walls. \r\nSo I drew a single strand walled box to fit a set of business cards and I added a bottom. My version has square corners because I ran into trouble in Blender when working with the rounded corners, I think it was the way I added the bottom. (I could not open the exported stl file in ReplicatorG-23 -- just a slew of error messages.)\r\nAnother challenge was that Skeinforge (35) did not like the cutout part at the top edge that you can see on the top photo. I had designed the box with the cut-out but it would just stop building at the bottom of the cutout making it a shorter box. \r\nSo I just made a square box the full height and then cut out the design afterwards.\r\nThe top fits very nicely and the \"seam\" that runs along the one side provides enough friction so that it does not slip off.\r\nAt 95mm it is the tallest piece Iâ€™ve made so far!\r\nI'm also including the stl file with the cut-out design that I was not able to build, (BuinessCardBox-3.stl), maybe some of you will have better luck (or skill) than me."
