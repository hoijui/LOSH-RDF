    okh:function """All the STLs required to print an ecksbot.  

The ecksbot design is a sturdier and sleeker derivative of the Prusa 2 built on EckerTech innovations and putting a little more Sells Mendel back into the mix, making it a true and evolutionary RepRap.  

We do not claim this as our own new design but rather another small step in the evolution of the RepRap hobby printer. It is designed around the concepts and efforts of the RepRap core team and should be considered as an extension of the project.  

We would like to thank the RepRap core team for inspiring not just us but the entire RepRap community to design, redesign, innovate and think outside the box.  Without the core team none of this would be possible.  

Keeping with RepRap tradition the ecksbot is released on the GPL license making this a true RepRap 3D printer.  

For more information on how we improved the ecksbot design over the Prusa 2 design please visit, blog.eckertech.com  

UPDATE:  Added ETC_c-end-idler2-adjuster, NewBearingHousingInner and NewBearingHousingOuter.  The new x end has a hole to add a bolt for easy z height adjustments.  The new bearing housing requires only acetone for adhesion and fits together better than the old version.""" ;
