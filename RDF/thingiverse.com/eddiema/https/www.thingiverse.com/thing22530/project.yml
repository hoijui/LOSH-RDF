function: "XL10t_pulley increased to 26mm around the screw hole. The original looks OK but they have been spiltting near the screw. Note that this probably won't work for the X pulley because of the \"ZEST\" screw. A normal pulley with lots of fill may be the best thing here.\r\nI've added a second part here - the \"r\" version has a 6*3mm recess for the screw head.\r\nThere is still a problem if the screw is too long.\r\nBased on http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6822 but redrawn in sketchup."
