function = "A kit of parts to join tubes to make an A-frame.\r\nMine is made from fibreglass tent poles which are a bit under 13mm in diameter. These just happened to be on special at $4au for a set of four (plus other bits).\r\nOtherwise I would have used 16mm curtain rod (which is tube actually). \r\nIt should be possible to re-scale the parts for other sizes.\r\nMy printrbot sits in a bamboo serving tray which has inside dimensions of 300*475mm.\r\nThe poles are 700mm long so the angle at the apex comes out close to 24 deg.\r\n\r\nThe parts are over engineered and are overkill to support a few kilos of plastic.\r\n\r\nI have left some early versions of parts in the SU file."
