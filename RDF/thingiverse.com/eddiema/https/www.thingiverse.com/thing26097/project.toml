function = "Some 3d printed parts for my ebike.\r\nThe bike is a HASA comp3.0 mountain bike fitted with a magic-pie-2 motor.\r\nThing one is a 3 piece junction box which clamps around the handle-bar neck. It is not IP-anything but better than leaving the wires dangling in the wind and rain.\r\nThe neck has \"saga\" printed on it, the neck angle is 100 degrees and the neck tubes are about 35mm OD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second thing is micro-switch mount to sense the brake lever home position. \r\nLevers with switches were supplied with the motor but the bike has combined gear and brake levers so I had to roll my own solution. \r\n\r\nThing-3.\r\nA mount for the cruise control switch. At least that is what golden motor call it. A bit like calling a nail a coat hanger.\r\nIt is a throttle lock which does not attempt to hold a set speed.\r\nPushing the button locks in the current throttle setting and it is cleared using the brake switches or pusing a second time. \r\nThe orginal part would not have mounted in this convenient position.\r\nPhotos of the older ebike are here.\r\nhttp://nerdipedia.com/tiki-index.php?page=magic+pie"
