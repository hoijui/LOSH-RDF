function = "Some parts I modified for my printer.\r\nThese are replacement parts. Add-ons can be found on some of my other thingyverse pages.\r\n\r\nOne difference to the orginal parts is the motor-mount and idler have holes for screws to lock the rods and bearings in place. This might help reduce the wobble a bit but don't expect miracles - the main problems are else-where. \r\n\r\nI've added the option to mount the x limit switch at the bottom. This is untested as I have mine on the side.\r\nThe usual top mounted X adjustment is fine for most people. The only advantage of the low position is you can take the extruder mount off without moving the adjuster screw. \r\n\r\nI do not have the back mounted z adjuster. \r\nI had nothing but trouble with original one and have mine at the front and with a locking mechanism - it works very well. \r\nIt is part of the new idler and\r\nI have an addon version - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23481 - you can find the knob etc there.\r\n\r\nAll your base (R belong to us).\r\n\r\nThere will be several.\r\nV1 is simply the orginal with the Z motors brought in .5mm so they should line up better with the Z lift nuts."
