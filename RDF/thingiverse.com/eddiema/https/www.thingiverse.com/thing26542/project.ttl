These are replacement parts. Add-ons can be found on some of my other thingyverse pages.\r
\r
One difference to the orginal parts is the motor-mount and idler have holes for screws to lock the rods and bearings in place. This might help reduce the wobble a bit but don't expect miracles - the main problems are else-where. \r
\r
I've added the option to mount the x limit switch at the bottom. This is untested as I have mine on the side.\r
The usual top mounted X adjustment is fine for most people. The only advantage of the low position is you can take the extruder mount off without moving the adjuster screw. \r
\r
I do not have the back mounted z adjuster. \r
I had nothing but trouble with original one and have mine at the front and with a locking mechanism - it works very well. \r
It is part of the new idler and\r
I have an addon version - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23481 - you can find the knob etc there.\r
\r
All your base (R belong to us).\r
\r
There will be several.\r
V1 is simply the orginal with the Z motors brought in .5mm so they should line up better with the Z lift nuts.""" ;
