function: "The basic plastic printerbot frequently produces bands on the sides of the prints which match the z-threaded rod pitch. This is most obvious on prints using .2mm or thinner slices.\r\nIn order to find the source of the problem I made custom parts to lock the bearings and rods in place. I also made an external bracing.\r\nThe source of the banding appears to be a rocking in the z-motors.\r\nThis causes uneven z-lift which in turn causes some layers to be squashed and buldge on the sides.\r\nThis is easiely fixed with a few wedges but the other parts may be of some use for people wanting a more rigid bot or to re-purpose for something else.\r\n\r\nAlso the z-motors are .5mm too far out on my bot. This is an error in the orginal CAD files. \r\nI have a corrected but untest version here. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26542\r\nI will be publishing more modified parts when I find time.\r\nI have done the CAD for a modified base with extra motor support but this is overkill for most people.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28557"
