function = "A step drill is a handy tool to have beside your 3d printer. They are a bit hard to turn in your fingers and an electric drill is overkill for sizing a hole.\r\nThis thing takes my step drill so I can turn it easily by hand. \r\nThe hex shaft looks pretty standard so you can probably use screw driver bits in it. \r\nOr maybe you can use a hex drive extender with it.\r\nNo doubt it has been done before.\r\nI'm posting two versions. \r\nOne has a hex hole right through and the other has the hole blocked off. \r\nI added a screw hole to lock the bit in.\r\nMy print was too tight but I put the PLA thing in hot water and the drill shaft slid in with no effort. It is stuck there now which is OK with me."
