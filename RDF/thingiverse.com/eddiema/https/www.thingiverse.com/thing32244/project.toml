function = "A thing to sit on a 6V latern battery. Sized to press fit onto a panasonic battery I have. It has holes for the spring terminals to poke through and a pair of slots which can take paperclips or similar as a low cost terminal contact.\r\nIt is nothing fancy - just something I can glue some electronics too."
