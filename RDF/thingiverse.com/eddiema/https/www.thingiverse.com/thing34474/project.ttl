    okh:function """A teaching aid for explaining the operation of an autogyro/gyrocopter.\r
A simple rotor head which uses one or two plastic rulers as a crude aerofoil.\r
I haven't gotten it to auto-rotate yet and maybe it won't - it is experimental.\r
This is not intended to ever fly.\r
\r
I don't know what the critical things are to achieve auto-rotation that is partly why I've made this. \r
\r
Obviously making a windmill is easy but that problably isn't the same thing.\r
\r
I'm lacking a good wind source for testing ATM. \r
My current feeling is the blades will need to be sanded to a better shape. \r
This is a very low priority project so it may take some time.\r
\r
There seems to me to be contradictory information on the web regarding blade pitch.\r
\r
It looks like slightly positive pitch is the norm for fixed pitch rotors.\r

Update1:\r
I tried the zero pitch rulers in front of an industrial fan and seemed to get some auto-rotation.\r
It was weak and the swirling uneven air-flow may not be causing true auto-rotation.""" ;
