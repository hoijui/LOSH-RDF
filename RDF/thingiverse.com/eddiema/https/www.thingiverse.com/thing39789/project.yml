function: "A cable chain bottom link which screws onto the printrbot  left Z motor mount.\r\nThis is for the basic plastic version with my improved stepper mounts/bases.\r\nI've made many variations and left them in the SU file. \r\nI really had to loop the chain to the side because other positions confict with my custom framing. \r\n\r\nThe chain is now in use but having used it I think an open (non-enclosed) system may be better (printing one ATM)."
