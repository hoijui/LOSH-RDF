function: "I just finished designing and building  \n\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39789   \n\nThe pain with enclosed cable chains is you can't easily rewire them or replace a link.  \n\nHere I've made a set with a U section instead of enclosed. It is also easier to clip these open links together than the closed ones.  \n\n\n\nExtras.  \n\nI've added some \"45-x\" part which can bend back 45 degrees as well as forwards.   \n\n\n\nLikewise the \"22-x\" is 22.5 degrees and \"9-x\" is 9 degrees"
