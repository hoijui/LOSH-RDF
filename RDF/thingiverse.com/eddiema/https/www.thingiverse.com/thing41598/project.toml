function = "The power case makes the phone much larger and heavier. It also means the standard cases don't fit.\r\nIf you have a S2 without the power case this mount will be way to big - scaling it down a little may work but that is an exercise for the reader.\r\nThere seem to be more than one model of case so YMMV. What I have is called \"Samsung Galaxy SII 1600mAh Power Case\".\r\n\r\nThis started as a belt mount but I've done a wall mount first."
