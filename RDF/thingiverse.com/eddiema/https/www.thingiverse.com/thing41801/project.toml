function = "Similar to my wall mount but takes a 32ish mm belt. \r\nIt is not a \"clip\" - the belt is fully captive. \r\n\r\nThis mount fits my power case - S2s without the case won't fit. Other makes of the case may or may not work.\r\n\r\nI used it in earnest today and it worked very well. The phone sits a little higher than it did using the leather belt clip case and the new position is better when pedalling a bike.\r\n\r\nThe corners can be a it sharp so I've done beltthing2 with them rounded. It slices OK but I haven't printed it."
