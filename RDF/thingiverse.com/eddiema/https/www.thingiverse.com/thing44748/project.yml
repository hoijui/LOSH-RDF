function: "A cable chain mount which includes mounting for a DB25 connector.\r\nI have included some versions which I can't use because I have external bracing on the bot. \r\nI will be using version C.\r\nThis mates with\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40918\r\nor\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11978\r\n\r\nThe chain sticks out on the left side of the bot and the connector is on the front. Mine will have the mating plug/socket with the cable pointing up."
