function: "This is the crystal structure of the human rhinovirus found at pdb.org. The x-ray crystal structure was transformed using Pymol and MGL tools. A course surface was placed over the atoms.  My goal is to print a bunch of these for use in teaching a class on viruses.\r\n\r\nPrint one and throw it to someone so they can \"catcha cold\" :)"
