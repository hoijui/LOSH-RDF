function = "Proteins are polymers of amino acids. The primary sequence of amino acids conveys to the protein the ability to fold into particular structures in three-dimensional space.  Thus a protein is a series of 3D domains strung together to give a protein a particular set of functions. For example, if death and EF hand domains are part of the same protein, the protein may trigger cell death with a rise in cellular calcium levels. New proteins are selected by evolutionary pressure when different domains are mixed and matched. I have uploaded a second version of CFP that is easier to remove the support material"
