function: "I was having problems printing PLA with my TOM, after a period of time the heat would conduct through the stainless steel pipe and melt the PLA near the drive gear (causing it to bind up and stop extruding).\r\n\r\nI tried to solve the problem by adding some heat sinks made from coins with an 8mm hole in the centre but on long prints (2+ hours) the PLA was still melting. \r\n\r\nI had a 40mm fan lying around so I redesigned the back part of the acrylic Stepstruder support to accomodate a fan that blows air directly on to the SS pipe. I stuck a thermometer on the top of the pipe and it's now at a temperature of 26C so no way close to melting the PLA."
