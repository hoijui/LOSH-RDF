function: "Are you a college student?\r\n\r\nDo you have a Nexus One?\r\n\r\nDo you wish your Nexus One mounted to your bedframe? (Note, I know this works on *most* beds at CMU and Elon Universities, you might want to check yours to make sure they have 3/8\" metal pins in the risers to hold your bed at any of a number of 3\" separated heights.) \r\n\r\nThere is a convenient hole for the LED indicator, and you should be able to reach all the soft buttons on the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\n*No responsibility will be taken for lost sleep because of text messages, emails, or internet wanderings on your cellphone now conveniently located next to your head.  You're in college, you don't need sleep.*\r\n\r\n**If you use your Nexus One as an alarm clock, no responsibility will be taken for you missing classes because your alarm clock is now located conveniently next to your head, making it easy to turn off and go back to sleep.  You're in college, you don't need to go to class.**\r\n\r\n***Sleep and going to class are both Good Things.***"
