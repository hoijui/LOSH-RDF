    okh:function """Improved version of the case for the the LC-100S inductance/capatitancy meter. This instrument is readily available at very low cost (approx USD 30) on ebay and elsewhere, but comes as a bare PCB without a case.  

This new, improved version is based on the improvements made to my original version by linearchaos in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:376273 . It is tuned even more, and also adds a real button for the "Func" key.  

There is one variant for the 4-button and one for the 3-key version of this meter.  

See build instructions for useful hints. (The picture shows the old version)  

Note: If you consider buying this meter, you should also look at the meter in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:641003 as an alternative. It can test quite a few more types of components.""" ;
