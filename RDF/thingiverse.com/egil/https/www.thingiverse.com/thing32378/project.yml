function: "Improved version of the case for the the LC-100S inductance/capatitancy meter. This instrument is readily available at very low cost (approx USD 30) on ebay and elsewhere, but comes as a bare PCB without a case.  \n\nThis new, improved version is based on the improvements made to my original version by linearchaos in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:376273 . It is tuned even more, and also adds a real button for the \"Func\" key.  \n\nThere is one variant for the 4-button and one for the 3-key version of this meter.  \n\nSee build instructions for useful hints. (The picture shows the old version)  \n\nNote: If you consider buying this meter, you should also look at the meter in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:641003 as an alternative. It can test quite a few more types of components."
