function = "In order to reduce z wobble I wanted to move the z rod bushings further apart.  By putting a bushing holder on the bottom clamp plate the spacing between the bushings is more than tripled.  This should reduce the impact of any play in the bushings.  I basically took the bushing mount from the original idler mount part and spliced it onto the clamping plate.  I made this for my MendelMax and it is working great for me.  I don't know if there is room for it to work on other models like the Prusa."
