function: "This is a newly made glass clip to hold 8\" by 8\" regular window glass you can buy at the hardware store to the bed of a Printrbot +.  For some reason the clip this is descended from didn't clip it tightly enough.  This is made from scratch but I got the idea from the other glass clip.  \n\nEdit: This was designed to work on a Printrbot + V1 with the bed leveling springs addon.  I don't know if it'll work with the V2 or without the springs as the size of the clips might interfere with other screws."
