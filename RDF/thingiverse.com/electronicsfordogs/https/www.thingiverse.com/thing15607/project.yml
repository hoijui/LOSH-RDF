function: "This thing has moved to Yumagine: https://www.youmagine.com/designs/jumbo-2-1mm-power-connector  \n\nWhen making up 2.1mm power connectors, I've always found it's really hard to fit the cable into the plastic cover (even if you remember to thread it onto the cable before you get the soldering iron out!).  \n\nThis part is a small case that fits over a 2.1mm power connector, but can house a really big cable (the cable in the pictures has an overal size of 4x8mm). In this example, we've soldered the cable to the tags on the connector and applied a bit of insulating tape.  \n\nMore things like this (and more about this) at http://electronicsfordogs.com."
