function = "This is a holder for a Whale GP1002 water pump and an optional liquid sensor. It keeps the pump upright, and the inlet as close to the bottom of the tank as possible, whilst leaving a small amount of water below it in attempt to leave any sediment behind.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a project to build a rainwater toilet, but may find uses elsewhere that these little pumps are used. The liquid sensor allows for the power to be switched off when there's no water available to pump.\r\n\r\nThe \"water-pump-float-holder\" variant is the same design, but with space to hold a Gentech LCS-01 horizontally mounted float switch."
