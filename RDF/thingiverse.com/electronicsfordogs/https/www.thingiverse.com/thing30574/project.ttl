This is a network socket that you can put on a shelf or desk. It means you don't need to fiddle about behind or under furniture looking for the wall or floor socket. Instead, you can put the socket wherever you want it and just plug in a patch cable and away you go!  

I got the idea from some hotels which have a similar sort of thing on the desk in the room.  

Someone said to me "just use a bit of velcro" - yeah, you could, but where's the fun in that?""" ;
