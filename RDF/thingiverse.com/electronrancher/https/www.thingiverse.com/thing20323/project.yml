function: "Tinker toys for big kids!  \r\n\r\nThis is a small printable cube that is used to construct frames and build objects using 5/16\" all thread rod.  5/16\" is the SAE size that will conveniently hold a 608 skate bearing.\r\n\r\nThe uploaded stl has holes through all 3 axes with one captive nut embedded in the sidewall.  This holds your rod/nut in place as you tighten the other nut on.  If you'd prefer captive nuts on both sides of each hole, then simply uncomment the noted line in the openScad file.\r\n\r\nThe location of the three axis holes and depth of captive nuts have been tuned to make roller bearings for 1/2\" black iron pipe using standard 608 skate bearings.  Bring your weird machines to life with dirt cheap all thread rod!"
