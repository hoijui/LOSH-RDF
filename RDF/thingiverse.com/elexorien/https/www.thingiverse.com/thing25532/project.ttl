\r
I found my old wooden one and decided it would be a great way to learn OpenSCAD.  I tried to make it as parametric as possible, and the default settings will print one the same size as my original wooden one.\r
\r
Included is my first ever attempt at OpenSCAD and pre-rendered STL's for both a single plate (139mm x 120mm) and individual pieces using a 13mm width.\r
\r
Originally I designed this from scratch.  Then I searched here to see if one was already uploaded.  I decided to make this a derivative of relet's Parametric Burr Puzzle Module as that is the closest thing to this puzzle, and I think you could make this one from his module.\r
\r
UPDATE:  FIxed the STL's so they are sitting on the origin plane and not under it. (Not sure if that makes a difference for anyone)""" ;
