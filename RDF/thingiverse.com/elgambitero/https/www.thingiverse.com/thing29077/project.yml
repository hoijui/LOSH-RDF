function: "This is a (so far) printable Enderman made in OpenSCAD. I wrote it looking at screenshots of Minecraft.  \n\n\n\nPrinted at 133% scale, it can hold calibration cubes.  \n\n(though the cube may weight so much and the Enderman falls on its face)  \n\n\n\nIt is printed upside down, and feet are made wider so it can stand.  \n\nIt needs no support material, and if you have your printer carefully tuned, there would be no problem.  \n\n\n\nThe mob itself is so skinny so printing it may be challenging.  \n\n\n\nEDIT: Enderman_holding feet are made bigger, so it can stand when holding nothing (at least)  \n\n\n\nEDIT (2): Idle Enderman's feet made bigger like the Enderman_Holding, and put in some Enderman 5.3 files."
