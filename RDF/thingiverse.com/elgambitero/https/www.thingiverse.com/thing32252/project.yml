function: "MOOOO!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Half unfeeling machine, half raging horned devil. This walking nightmare has a rocket launcher for an arm and will definitely reach out and touch you.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't heard nothing about Doom here in Thingiverse, but there has to be someone who faced this thing at least once! Where are all the Doom fans?\r\n\r\nThis was my first attempt on making something with Sculptris, and at cutting abstract geometries to make them printable, so this is the result.\r\nIt was modelled in Sculptris, looking at the game sprites; posed, corrected, and cut in Blender, and repaired with NetFabb Basic.\r\nThen it was painted by a friend of mine, with miniature paints.\r\n\r\nThis is a High Poly model, so if Slic3r takes 5 minutes to slice it don't worry.\r\n\r\nBy the time being, it doesn't stand on its feet, unless you put a piece of paper on its left hoof. My plan is to make a pedestal specially designed for it, with a \"Cyberdemon\" hellish sign being displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blender file with armature for posing is not provided by now because it is 150MB big, and I don't know if the server can bear it."
