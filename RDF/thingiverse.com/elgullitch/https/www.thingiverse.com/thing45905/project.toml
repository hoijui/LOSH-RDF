function = "Want to add slick transparent side panels to your Replicator 2 like those on the 2X?  Just print 4 of these clips for each side and cut yourself some polycarbonate sheet.  They'll snap firmly in place but are easily removed when necessary.  Good for reducing drafts and dust in your build area."
