function: "Inspired by rlspell's http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17194, this drop-in has been modeled from scratch to fit all 8020 Series 10 extrusions.  This nut can be dropped in and locked in place with a #10 screw.\r\nSafety Disclaimer: \r\nThis is only for non-structural applications such as attaching panels or connecting self-supporting frames.  Do not use for weight bearing structures (like shelving).  Genuine 8020 hardware is readily available from distributors or on ebay (look for 8020inc) and I use it extensively."
