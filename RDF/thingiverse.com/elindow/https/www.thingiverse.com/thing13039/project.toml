function = "These risers will provide about 5\" of clearance between the bottom of the TOM with the electronics and the parts that do the printing. This is enough (for me, at least) to work fairly easily on just about any of the individual pc boards to check voltages, swap cables, etc.\r\n\r\nThese risers are designed to work in conjunction with the excellent large and small TOM feet designed by Deltatgear: http://www.thingiverse.com/deltagear and Fillibar: http://www.thingiverse.com/fillibar. Thanks to the two of them for those original designs.\r\n\r\nThis combination makes a nice stable support for the printing mechanism, enough so that I probably won't remove them even when I stop fooling around with the electronics, if that day ever comes."
