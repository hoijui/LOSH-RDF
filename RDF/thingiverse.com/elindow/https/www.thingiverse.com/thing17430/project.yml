function: "A corbel in architecture is a protruding bracket used as a support. In other words, a form of shelf bracket, usually with a curved piece spanning the two legs. Some are quite ornamental, but these are a simple mixture of rectangluar solids and an arc.\r\n\r\nThese brackets could be useful for building small shelf units such as spice racks, for modelling buildings (dollhouses, model railroads, etc.), or pretty much anywhere else you need a small support.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSCAD file is fully parametric, so many sizes and variations can be created, as shown in the photo."
