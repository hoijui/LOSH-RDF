    okh:function """This is a set of pieces from which a model of a Doric order Greek or Roman temple can be built. All the pieces are easily printable on a ToM or equivalent, and the parts can be fitted together without glue to create a full, stable structure (kind of like the Greeks and Romans did thousands of years ago, but in plastic instead of stone.) \r
\r
Because all of the pieces have been created using OpenSCAD, infinite variations are possible. For example, with a little time it would be possible to build a pretty good model of the Parthenon.\r
\r
The sizes of the parts are all based on the diameter of a column (the 'modulus' of Vitruvius), so in openSCAD there is a single parameter that can be used to control the overall size and proportions. Individual proportions can also be modified as desired. The supplied .stl files are more or less attuned to the 'golden rectangle'. (Note: I am not an art historian and make no claim that the proportions or even the pieces themselves are exactly as they should be. Anyone with more expertise than me is more than welcome to suggest improvements of any kind to this design.) \r
\r
While I did this primarily for fun and to improve my skills in openSCAD, there are more than a few possible uses for these parts in architectural, dollhouse, and railroad modeling. The fluted columns might serve well for wedding cake layer dividers or anything else that deserves truly classic support. \r
\r
These parts also could be useful in education, both for studying proportion in art and design classes, and as part of a study of the Classical world in general.\r
\r
Or, of course, you could just  build your own little shrine to your god or goddess of choice:)""" ;
