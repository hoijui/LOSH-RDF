function: "This item is intended to  solve a familiar problem for anyone who uses small bottles of paint, glue, or other volatile or messy liquids; i.e. to provide a solid support for these bottles so the danger of tipping when using a brush, toothpick, eyedropper, etc. is greatly decreased. These holders also have small vertical supports around the edge for small items.\r\n\r\nSince the design is parametric it can easily be customized for pretty much any sized bottle that will fit your printer's bed. The design is optimized to use as little plastic as possible while still providing a solid support."
