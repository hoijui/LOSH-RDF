I found the great looking design by jpmurph didn't quite work for me when printed on my Replicator.  I was able to fix up the STL file in Blender and now it works great!\r
\r
The bug I found was that the hex nut hole was 20% too small and not far enough recessed to allow bolt to solidly connect with it.  I also shortened the base a bit, to be more minimal and snug.\r
