function = "This servo holder is made to hold HXT500 type servos (5 gram micro servo in any kind of R/C vehicle or other machine that needs servos. I designed it to hide the servos evenly in the wings of my R/C airplanes (used as aileron or flap servos on my scratchbuilt foamies). \r\n\r\nThere is a \"left\" and a \"right\" version (mirrored) - use whatever fits your needs best. For mirrored applications (such as in R/C plane wings) you might want to use both versions.\r\n\r\nThe showed holders are printed in silver coloured PLA plastic. \r\nWeight of each holder (in PLA silver) is about 3 grams.\r\n\r\nThe servo can be found here: \r\nhttp://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewitem.asp?idproduct=663&aff=141728\r\n\r\nEDIT 1:"
