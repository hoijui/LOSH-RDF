function = "This is a case for the GoPro Hero HD Camera. I printed this in soft PLA material. It was designed to be mounted on a R/C model airplane. The ribs on the front side are for shock absorbing in case of a crash. There are openings for the knobs and for the direct A/V-Out. Like this it is possible to use it as FPV camera.\r\n\r\n--> FPV: First Person View; more info on: \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Person_View"
