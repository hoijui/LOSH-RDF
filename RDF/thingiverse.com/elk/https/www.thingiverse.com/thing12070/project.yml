function: "This is the largest printing project I designed so far... we call it the ScoopLamp! It is a lamp made of only printed parts, it doesn't need any tools to assemble (if well printed) and no glue or screws (only a piece of steel wire or a cable tie to fix it on the bulb holder). \r\n\r\nThe Lamp on the photos is printed with a 0.5mm nozzle. I used PLA silver for the segments and white ABS for the rings. One element took about 7 hours to print on my setup :)"
