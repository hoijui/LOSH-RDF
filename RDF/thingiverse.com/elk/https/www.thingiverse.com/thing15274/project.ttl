    okh:function """This is a frame vertex for Mendel / Prusa Mendel using less material than the solid version. I know there are other attempts of vertexes - so this is just an additional one. \r
\r
There is a version with feet and one without. \r
For a Mendel / Prusa Mendel, 6 vertexes are necessary. You can print two without feet and four with feet\r
\r
Comments are welcome!\r
\r
--> Please mind: this is for M8 rod!\r
\r
Comments after the first print:\r
The vertex without feet weights 12 grams.\r
I printed it in ABS with 4 shells, 0.35mm nozzle, and with relatively coarse infill (you can see the infill on the picture of the vertexes while printing). \r
If I calculate that weight back to filament length it tells me that it takes about 1650mm of 3mm feedstock to print one of these.\r
\r
Comments after the second print:\r
Printed the version with feet now. \r
Again in ABS, this time with 2 shells, 0.35mm nozzle, same coarse infill and they are 11 grams. They feel really robust but I did not screw a frame together yet so still needs to be tested if two such thin shells are ok.""" ;
