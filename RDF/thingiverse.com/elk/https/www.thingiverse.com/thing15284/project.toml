I just made some minor adjustments (cosmetics / reinforcements / easier sliede-in of bearings...):\r\n\r\n- Rounded screw-surface (a bit less material used)\r\n- Beveled attachement (minor reinforcement)\r\n- Bevel for better slide-in of bearings\r\n\r\nComments after the first print:\r\nPrints nice! Made with a 0.35mm nozzle, ABS, 2 shells... see pic. The print was not reworked - except the drilling (pierced through with a file...)."
