function: "Just a derivate of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17455 that is printable without support material. It has one additional part. Highest part is 94mm high (a bit less than the original due to possibilities of my mendel...). There are two different sizes of the membrane holder... smaller one works, bigger one still printing printed and working even better than smaller one. due to greater membrane diameter, it seems to work better with lower ferquencies... I would suggest to try the 30mm version.\r\n\r\nthe picture shows my print in clear PLA (oops some black found its way out the nozzle too...) with the smaller membrane housing.\r\n\r\nIf you like it, you can check and comment my other designs here: http://www.thingiverse.com/elk/things"
