function: "I was thinking about making my own t-shirt artwork eversince, but silkprinting needs much equipment that I didn't want to buy to just make two or tree shirts for my own...\r\n\r\nSo I invented another Idea: The 3D printable t-shirt (or textile) artwork. PLA will melt at about 60\xC2\xB0C - fair enough to be ironed-on to any kind of fabric. I tested it with some bags I am sewing to organize my luggage for holiday... :)\r\n\r\nedit 1: added some more critters to experiment with.."
