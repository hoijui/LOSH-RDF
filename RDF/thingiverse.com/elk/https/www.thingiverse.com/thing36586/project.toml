function = "If you want to fit a Denon DL-110 cartridge (instead of a Rega cartridge) to your RB-300 tonearm (on a Rega P3), then you will need a spacer because the Denon cartridge is higher than the Rega cartridge. \r\n\r\nThis spacer will not need another nut (will just fit) to fix the tonearm.\r\nThis spacer is 3.70mm high which I found the best choice for the Denon DL-110 Cartridge. If you need a different height, let me know and I'll upload one...\r\n\r\nEDIT1: Added 2mm spacer for Nagaoka 110 (needs verification)"
