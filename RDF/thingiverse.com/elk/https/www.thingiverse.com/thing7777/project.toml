function = "This is a clip to fit the M8 studding / rods of a reprap mendel machine and hold any wires / cables down to the rod. \r\nIt can be used instead of zip ties (I had to cut many zip ties again during my mendel build). The CableClippy can be re-opened with ease and helps to keep your cable chaos neatly arranged :)"
