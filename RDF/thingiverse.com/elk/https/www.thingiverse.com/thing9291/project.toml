function = "I had some difficulties to get the wade screw ready properly. I tried the tap-method but was not successful so I decided to try the teeth version. This \"thing\" will show a method to get a desired amount of teeth into the bolt and how to divide the surface of this screw into exactly same sized teeth.\r\n\r\nYou will find all about the wade extruder here: \r\nhttp://reprap.org/wiki/Wade's_Geared_Extruder\r\n\r\n...and here on Thingiverse:\r\n http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1794\r\n\r\nCan actually also be used on other similar extruder designs."
