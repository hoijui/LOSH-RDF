function: "I really did not like how the extra cooling fan mounted on the Mosaic.   The big thing that I hated was that it blocked the view of the build!   I like to watch!  So here is a design that mounts the secondary fan on the side, and it has a nozzle that moves the air near the extruder.   \r\n\r\nIt may be a bit of overkill just because I am still learning up the tool chain, and I may refractor the nozzle/fan air chamber as one part at a later time.  \r\n\r\nI will also post just a side mount fan mount without the nozzle on another post(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13881).  It is far simpler if you are just looking to move the fan out of the way."
