function = "My 2 year old loves to play pilot, so I decided to make her some wings to look the part. There are 3 types. the wings themselves are the same, the shield that sits on them is different. 1 is a circle, 2 is a rounded bottom shield and 3 is a pointed bottom sheld. the trek version has the Starfleet Delta on the shield. i always imagined Starfleet having a fighter wing. So I had to give in to my fantasy. Feel free to add emblem variants as you see fit. I will upload a pic of the test prints after I get them painted. my machine is still new so while it had some problems a fully dialed in machine shouldn't have any problems at all."
