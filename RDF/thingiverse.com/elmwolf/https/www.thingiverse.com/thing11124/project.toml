function = "I freely admit to being a Trekie, and ocassionaly I feel the need to don my old Starfleet Uniform. Since I got my Printer running it was only inevitable that I would find a way to trick out my geekdom with Starfleet Rank Pips. Attached you will find several versions. The Provisional Ranks seen in Voyager, The Standard Ranks Seen in TNG and DS9 and even the Future ranks seen on the crew of the U.S.S. Relativity Time Ship. The Magna pip and the back for it are intended to use 8mm(dia) rare earth magnets that i found at a local hardware store. I haven't figured out how to wear the others Hence these will remain a work in progress. enjoy."
