function = "I have seen several ring designs on Thingiverse, Heck the first model I built was a ring that i am still trying to get a printed model. These are the next evolution of my rings. I started with a Ginormous blockey ring. While wearable it looked rather dorkey. Then I created the square head ring which I will eventually make a new version of as it is a very nice looking ring. Finally I came to the smooth rounded rings. These rings are very close to what I am wanting. I am trying to build a ring to replace my old class ring that got broken a long time ago. so here ya go. My next step is going to be to dress up the sides of the ring much more like an actual class ring."
