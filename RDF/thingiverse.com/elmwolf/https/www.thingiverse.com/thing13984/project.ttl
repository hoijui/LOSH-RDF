I am a geek, through and through, and this coin explains that. The Face of it is a decent melding of Star Trek, Star Wars and Stargate, the Back has the simple and elegant word GEEK emblazoned on it. It screams that I am a Sci-Fi Bi Geek. ;c) And to top it all off it's printed on a 3d printer. What could be geekier." ;
