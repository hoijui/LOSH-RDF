function: For quite a while I have been trying to find a way to answer that question, What makes me, Me? I came to the realization that this was the final answer. I am a geek, through and through, and this coin explains that. The Face of it is a decent melding of Star Trek, Star Wars and Stargate, the Back has the simple and elegant word GEEK emblazoned on it. It screams that I am a Sci-Fi Bi Geek. ;c) And to top it all off it's printed on a 3d printer. What could be geekier.
