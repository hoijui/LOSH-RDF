function: My 3 year old is in love with a TV Show called the Octonauts. It's new here in the US and has been out in England for a little longer. She has to watch it every day and since it started airing she has constantly being running around the house pretending to be one of the Characters. So after not being able to find any toys or anything else here in the US I promptly designed it myself.
