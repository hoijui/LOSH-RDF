function = "My Parents bought my daughter a little fishing pole to learn how to cast with and teach her the concept of fishing. Of course the first thing she did was tear off the casting plug it came with and promptly loose it. Sooo I created this. Print it as densely as possible. I printed mine with my \"large object\" print setup which makes it have very large gaps. as a result it's light as a feather. But it is Functional and just needs to be printed again to make it fly a little farther when cast."
