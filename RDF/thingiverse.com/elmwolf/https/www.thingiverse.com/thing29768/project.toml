function = "As a former Boy Scout Leader I am always looking for ways to uphold the scout motto of \"Be Prepared\", so when my 3 year old asked me why Batman is the only super hero to have a Utility Belt of \"cool stuff\" the only answer I could come up with was that the other hero's didn't really need the cool stuff because they had powers and Batman didn't. So she then promplty replied that she needed a utility belt of cool stuff. What you see here is the first step to that utility belt. Small cylinders that can contain things and are lightweight, and easily produceable. As a Scout leader I can see these replaceing the 35mm film canister as a place to carry your matches. My daughter sees them as something to conceal a couple gold fish or a tootsie roll in. \r\nI would love to see what kinds of things the rest of us can use these for. In the mean time I will be working on a \"cool\" way to carry them on a belt."
