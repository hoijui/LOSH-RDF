function = "REVISED:  Larger sides for the bolts, more accurate with the holes, but smaller holes.\r\n\r\nI have bragged on my ToM so much that it was bound to get my co-worker's request for his missing wrist joint for the right hand on his puppets.  (Bre may be interested in this.)  My co-worker has always just used the left-handed wrist joint, but this makes the right hand slightly cattywhompus.  This thing #7716 should fix him up.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  New picture shows painted thing #7716 in place and working beautifully."
