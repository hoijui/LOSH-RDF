function: "I've had some problems getting my prints to stay flat on the build plate and / or stick to the build plate with my Makerbot Replicator 1.  I know that others have to and that solutions have been difficult to find.  My solution is to create a custom slicing profile with these raft settings.  \n\nThis method takes longer and uses more plastic for rafts but works consistently.  \n\nI have an updated version that works better: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:102619"
