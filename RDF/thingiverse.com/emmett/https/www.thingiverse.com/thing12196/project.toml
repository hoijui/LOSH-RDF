function = "The screens on the windows in my apartment are held on by crappy little plastic clips, most of which broke off long before I moved in.  Duct tape was all the held up one of those screens and a couple days ago I came home to find it had given way.  \r\n\r\nMakerbot to the rescue!  I printed 9 replacement clips at once, fixing not only the fallen screen, but the rest of the screens in the house that had one or two broken clips.  It's hard to even tell the difference between these and the originals, except I think the printed ones are actually stronger."
