\r
Makerbot to the rescue!  I printed 9 replacement clips at once, fixing not only the fallen screen, but the rest of the screens in the house that had one or two broken clips.  It's hard to even tell the difference between these and the originals, except I think the printed ones are actually stronger.""" ;
