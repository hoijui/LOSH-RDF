function = "UPDATE: There is a new version of this design which is more reliable to print and easier to assemble. I highly recommend you use it instead: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:243278  \n***  \nAt last, here is the much-requested 100% printable heart gears.  No more ugly bolt holes!  This was designed along the same lines as the screwless cube gears: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10483, and in fact uses the exact same center block (though the pins are slightly shorter).  \n\nUPDATE: If you lack a 3D printer, you can now buy these from CarryTheWhat at http://www.etsy.com/shop/CarryTheWhat.  \n\nThe size has been increased a bit from the previous version to accommodate the printed pins, so it now measures 100mm across when assembled.  Since everything is now printable, it should be easy to scale this design up or down as you see fit.  At this size it took me ~6 hours of printing time on my TOM."
