function: "I was recently interviewed on a local radio station (99.9 KISW, Seattle) for BJ Shea's Geek of the Week series.  I brought my Thing-O-Matic down to the station and printed out some custom designs based on their show's logo.  \r\n\r\nYou can watch the interview here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=4Yf6ZXlodvA, or if you'd prefer, there's also an audio-only version here:  http://www2.kisw.com/listen/bj-sheas-geek-nation-geek-week-2."
