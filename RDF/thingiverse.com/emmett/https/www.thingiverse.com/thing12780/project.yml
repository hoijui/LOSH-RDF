function: "Many bracelets exist already here on thingiverse (one of my favorites is MakeALot's:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7354), but most are rigid shapes.  This design bends smoothly around the wrist and clasps in a secure, yet smooth and unobtrusive way.  The intent is also to show how any bas relief design can be turned into a unique flexible bracelet.  The pattern shown here is simply a pleasing combination of sinusoids.\r\n\r\nThere are several levels of personalization available, depending on how much effort you want to put in.  The easiest is to scale the file to fit your wrist (the current design has a circumference of 17.1cm with two pieces).  Any number can be joined to form a larger circle.  By adding M1 commands to the Gcode you can switch colors at different heights to highlight certain features (as shown).  And finally, you can modify the OpenSCAD file to turn your own design into a segmented, flexible bracelet."
