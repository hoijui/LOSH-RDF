function: "The Ouroboros is an ancient symbol of a serpent eating its own tail.  It is often said to symbolize the cycle of death and rebirth, but I think it applies just as well to the way new ideas and designs are derived from old ones in a collaborative environment such as Thingiverse.  In any case, my girlfriend likes it.\r\n\r\nPart of this thing's purpose is to show an example of personalizing the flexible bracelet design to a sculpture of your choice.  The head of the snake is actually http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1466, simplified in MeshMixer."
