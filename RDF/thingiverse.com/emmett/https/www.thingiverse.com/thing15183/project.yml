function: "This is a Cassegrain antenna dish, due to the convex secondary reflector.  The optics have been calculated appropriately, such that if you somehow managed to smooth out the surfaces and make them shiny, this would focus a far away light into a small spot in the center of the dish (where the receiver would be).  \r\n\r\nUPDATE: The files have been updated to make this easier to print."
