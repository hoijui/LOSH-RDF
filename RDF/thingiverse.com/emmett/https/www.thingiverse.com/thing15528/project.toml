function = "This moon rover is pretty simple; the real point is the treads.  The idea of turning my Stretchy Bracelet into tank tracks is thanks to BenRockhold.  Turns out it works really well: if you push this around on a slightly grippy surface like carpet, the tracks roll easily.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the track keys into the wheels so well, this could probably be used as a timing belt or chain."
