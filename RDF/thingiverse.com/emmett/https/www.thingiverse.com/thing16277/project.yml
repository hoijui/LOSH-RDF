function: While playing with my Moon Rover tread, I found it zipped into itself pretty well.  This is an adjusted version that can zip into both sides.  It's flexible in several dimensions and easily layered.  It's quite fun, and I'm curious what uses or interesting shapes you all can come up with for it.
