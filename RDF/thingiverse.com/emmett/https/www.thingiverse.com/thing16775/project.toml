function = "My girlfriend challenged me to make a hand soap dispenser that is cooler than anything we could buy at Crate & Barrel (or similar stores).  The result, after a number of design iterations, is this bottle which now inhabits our bathroom.  \r\n\r\nThis dispenser is designed to reduce waste in a number of ways.  First, it is easily refillable, and so can be used for many years.  Second, as the pump is turned, liquid soap spills from the spout back into a hole in the bottle, thus recycling any drips.  Third, this design makes it easy to get as much or as little soap as you want, while commercial soap pumps often dispense more soap than necessary with a single squeeze."
