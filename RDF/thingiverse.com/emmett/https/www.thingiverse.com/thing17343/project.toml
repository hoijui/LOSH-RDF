But, hey, reproduction is sexy, right?  \r\n\r\nThanks to Wikipedia and the hard work of many scientists to measure tiny molecules, this is an accurate 35,000,000:1 scale model of DNA.  It's a playset because you print out copies of the four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) and snap them together into whatever sequence you like."
