Everyone seems to love showing off their powder printers by making these, so I decided to see if it was possible to make one on a Makerbot.  Turns out as long as the scale is small enough, these overhangs and bridges print quite well with no support.  \r
\r
I was printing these dualstrusion gyroids at the Seattle Mini Makerfaire on my new Replicator (they only take about 30 minutes).  There's also a couple of single color versions included.  You can stack these in all three dimensions to form a continuous surface.""" ;
