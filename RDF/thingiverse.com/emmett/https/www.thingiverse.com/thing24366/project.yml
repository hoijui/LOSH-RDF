function: "The Gyroid is a periodic minimal surface discovered in the '70s.  Everyone seems to love showing off their powder printers by making these, so I decided to see if it was possible to make one on a Makerbot.  Turns out as long as the scale is small enough, these overhangs and bridges print quite well with no support.  \r\n\r\nI was printing these dualstrusion gyroids at the Seattle Mini Makerfaire on my new Replicator (they only take about 30 minutes).  There's also a couple of single color versions included.  You can stack these in all three dimensions to form a continuous surface."
