\r
I've included both left and right versions, though you may need to try both to see which you like better.  My left-handed girlfriend likes the left version, but so do I, even though I'm right-handed.  That's probably just because I hold my pens weird (see pix).  In any case, it makes a nice desk ornament.""" ;
