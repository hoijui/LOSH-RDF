function: "I designed this pen out of Sublime/mraiser's propeller and was pleased to find that it resembles the quill pens of old, so I designed an upright base to stand it in.  I find it is quite a natural shape to hold in the hand.\r\n\r\nI've included both left and right versions, though you may need to try both to see which you like better.  My left-handed girlfriend likes the left version, but so do I, even though I'm right-handed.  That's probably just because I hold my pens weird (see pix).  In any case, it makes a nice desk ornament."
