function = "These rhombic dodecahedra are unconnected, yet inseparable. They have been specifically sized for the Dual Replicator, in such a way that both extruders can be used at once (using JoeyC's script), to print different color interlocking polyhedra. \r\n\r\nThis thing turns out to be pretty fun to play with; it makes a decent rattle and I enjoy the game of hanging onto one end and trying to swing it to make all six modules stack upright."
