function: "This chain of 40 interlocking rhombic dodecahedra forms a loop that covers nearly the whole Replicator build platform. It's not quite big enough to be a necklace, but it can work as a crown or other decoration. It's quite fun to play with.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSCAD file is parametric, so if you have a different size build platform, you can adjust the dimensions of the loop by changing the number of modules in the straight section and scaling the whole."
