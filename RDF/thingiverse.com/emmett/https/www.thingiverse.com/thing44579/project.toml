function = "UPDATE: I have new a much better version of this design here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1221494\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed Eric Young's design of his Secret Heart Box, but I didn't relish hunting down all the required parts to put it together. One thing I learned from designing the Blossoming Lamp is that it's entirely possible to 3D print complex, preassembled mechanisms without breaking the 45-degree rule. I took it as a challenge to show that it's possible even with something as seemingly complex as this locking heart box. See the video here: http://youtu.be/PPqLB-bv4gY  \r\n\r\nUPDATE: By popular demand, I've modified the customizer code so you can now add words to the top of the heart. Make sure your valentine knows it's just for them.  \r\n\r\nA big Thank You to the good people at Makerbot and the bot farm for printing 100 of these as favors for my wedding. It's good to have a friend with a factory."
