\r
I really enjoyed Eric Young's design of his Secret Heart Box, but I didn't relish hunting down all the required parts to put it together. One thing I learned from designing the Blossoming Lamp is that it's entirely possible to 3D print complex, preassembled mechanisms without breaking the 45-degree rule. I took it as a challenge to show that it's possible even with something as seemingly complex as this locking heart box. See the video here: http://youtu.be/PPqLB-bv4gY  \r
\r
UPDATE: By popular demand, I've modified the customizer code so you can now add words to the top of the heart. Make sure your valentine knows it's just for them.  \r

A big Thank You to the good people at Makerbot and the bot farm for printing 100 of these as favors for my wedding. It's good to have a friend with a factory.""" ;
