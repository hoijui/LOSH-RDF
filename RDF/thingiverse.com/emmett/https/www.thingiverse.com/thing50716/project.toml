function = "UPDATE: This design has been superseded by my newer version, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:213946, which has better pins. I highly recommend you print that instead, as it prints more reliably, assembles much easier and holds together better.   \n***  \nI figured it was high time I updated my cube gears to use my newer pin library, and while I'm at it, why not make it customizable? The new pins fit in much easier than before, and if you have any trouble, you can change the tolerance and get new pins from the customizer app.   \n\nThis cube gear has different numbers of teeth than my original, which means you have to turn it more to get back to a cube. The customizer also has the original gearing as an option, as well as one with fewer teeth (good for making it small).   \n\nI also put in the ability to put words on the faces of the large gears. This way you can make a personal gift, or maybe a silly game where different word pairs come together as you turn the cube. I'd like to see what you come up with."
