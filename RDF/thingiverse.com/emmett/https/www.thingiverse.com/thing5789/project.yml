function: The bearing on the Plastruder Mk5 on my Thing-O-Matic fell out a couple of times on me.  Seemed tight enough, but the vibration would eventually knock it loose.  This was my ~30 minute fix to the problem, which is working splendidly.  Hopefully now it will only take the next person 10 minutes to fix.
