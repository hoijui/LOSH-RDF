function = "This is a surprisingly difficult puzzle for a lot of people, both to assemble and disassemble (provided you have a good friction fit between the parts).  I was inspired by a similar wooden puzzle that was given to me, but that one had different types of pieces with a key block that made assembly quite easy.  I realized no key was necessary, so I made this version and changed the shape slightly."
