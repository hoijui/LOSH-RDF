function: 'Now that you have a planetary gearset that functions as its own bearing, what else can you do with it? How about a large reduction in a small package: This drive gives a 91:1 gear ratio. It''s much more convenient to print than the last version, and the only assembly required is placing the output ring onto the upper planets of the input.'
