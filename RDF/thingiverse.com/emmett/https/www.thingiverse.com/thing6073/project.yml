function: "UPDATE: This design has been superseded by my newest version, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:213946, which is all printed and snaps together.  \n***  \nThis started out as an exercise in using Greg Frost's awesome involute bevel gear script http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3575, but turned into a rather pleasing worry-ball type thing.  It's also clearly influenced by Greg's broken heart http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4683, though this has octahedral gears rather than dodecahedral, so they all mesh with each other and spin.  My favorite thing about it is that you can grab two opposite gears and twist them, making the center with the other six gears spin rapidly around."
