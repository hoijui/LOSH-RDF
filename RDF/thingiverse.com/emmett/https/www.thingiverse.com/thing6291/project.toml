function = "I highly recommend using the most current version of this design, found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:243278  \n***  \nFor a very nerdy Valentine's Day, I give you heart gears.  This was inspired by Greg Frost's Broken Heart http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4683, but it fits in the palm of your hand and can be twisted like some kind of worry ball.  It makes use of the heart shape from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6190, the MCAD involute bevel gear script from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3575, and nophead's polyhole script for making properly dimensioned tap holes http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6118.  \n\nUPDATE: If you lack a 3D printer, you can now buy these from CarryTheWhat at http://www.etsy.com/shop/CarryTheWhat.  \n\nI was daunted by the complexity of Greg's design, so this one is much simpler, having fewer gears, and a much simpler attachment design (simply thread the bolts into tight plastic holes).  It also uses a smooth heart shape and is made for the hand instead of the desk."
