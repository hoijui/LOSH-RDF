    okh:function """As much as I love OpenSCAD, constructive solid geometry is just not efficient at certain tasks and I got tired of waiting for hundreds of spheres to be unioned and rendered to make a knot.  This is a parametric Matlab script to do the same thing as MakeALot's script, but in seconds instead of hours, plus the mesh is smoother.  \r
\r
The [3,1] knot I printed required more material for support than the print did, but it came out nice in the end.  I designed it to fit a 12.7mm steel ball I had extras of from a Geomag set.  Since the knot is toroidal, the ball freely rolls around the inside without falling out.\r
\r
I included a couple of other example knot STLs in case you can't run the script.""" ;
