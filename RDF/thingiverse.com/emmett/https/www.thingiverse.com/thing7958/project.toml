function = "A Moineau pump is a type of positive displacement pump with steady flow (no pulsing).  This type of pump is common in the food processing industry because it can efficiently pump slurries (like soup) without crushing the contents.  This one pumps 32 cc/revolution (neglecting whatever leaks back through the seals) and is capable of pumping water (milk is shown for contrast).  \r\n\r\nI thought this might be useful as a paste extruder or something of that nature.  It's better than a peristaltic pump because no flexible hose is needed (which tend to reduce efficiency and wear out), plus it doesn't pulse."
