function = "My goal was to design an X Carriage from scratch with the following attributes:\r\n\r\nCompact Size to maximize X Travel.\r\nLeft and Right side 30mm fan mounts.\r\nScrew and nut mount for LM8UU linear bearings.\r\n4 post mount to minimize wobble.\r\n5mm platform height and 3mm wall width for rigidity.\r\nLarge orifice to accommodate different hot ends.\r\nFits the Prusa Mendel Iteration 2.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty happy with the results and I hope you are too. :)\r\n\r\nVersion 4 fixes laying issue.
