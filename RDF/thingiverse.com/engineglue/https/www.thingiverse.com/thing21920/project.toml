function = "This as a flying disc modeled after an Innova Disc Golf Champion TL Fairway Driver (7 5 0 1). :) I designed it from scratch and it's certainly not exact. The attached STL is 210mm in diameter which is the same diameter as the Innova. This disc is flat on the top as where the Innova is curved up to a flat surface. The black disc in the picture and video was scaled to 80% so it would fit on my print bed and it was modeled with 24 sides. The attached STL was modeled with 999 sides. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nLook! It flys! \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft0o8aDtNak"
