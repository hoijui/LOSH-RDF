The modules were originally intended for a Cricket (darts) scoreboard, but the rings are made of 4 LEDs each with two LED slashes inside..\r\n\r\nI bought the DS1307 kit from Adafruit (http://adafruit.com/products/264) to act as the RTC, and the main PCB is one I designed to hold an Atmega328 which I burned with an Arduino bootloader.
