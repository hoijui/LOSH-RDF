function: "\"Top layer\" is the second layer of the cake.  Adorned with the finest decorations, it is a testament to the wisdom and strength of the ages.\r\n\r\n\"Top guy\" is Captain 61, who stands triumphant atop the birthday cake.  He's posing with his foot on the top layer of the cake, enjoying the splendid view from the top.\r\n\r\n\"Multi Candle\"  is an array of 64 candles for the cake.  Why 64?  Because you'll break four of them.  They fit snugly into the bottom layer of the cake.  The 61st candle is a part of Captain 61.\r\n\r\n\"Cake 1\" is the foundation of the cake.  A mighty base, it has supports for the second layer, as well as the bold, extruded birthday tidings of a loyal son."
