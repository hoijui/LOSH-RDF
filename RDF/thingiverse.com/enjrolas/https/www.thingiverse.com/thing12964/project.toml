function = "This is my first version of a R/C steerable bristlebot.  I was inspired by the Evil Mad Scientist Labs' design(http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/bristlebot), but I wanted to make a cheap, vector-steerable bristlebot, and this is what I came up with.  Powered by two vibrating motors and two toothbrush heads (read the EMSL post to see more about what types of toothbrushes work), this little bot scoots around the floor at delightful speeds.  It's like the scrubbing bubbles mascot and a hummingbird had a kid.\r\n\r\nVideo of an early prototype doin' its thang is here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bridgewalker/6276616359/in/photostream"
