function: "This is my cute little R/C bristlebot.  The concept and electronics are based on my first R/C 'bot, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12964/  This guy is much neater looking, though, and the circular shape is to allow it to spin when it bumps into obstacles.  Bristlebots can't back up, so this is important.\r\nThe bot is surprisingly fast and exeedingly adorable.  The circular shape didn't really work, though--I need to make the shell come down almost to the ground to keep the bristles from catching on stuff as it tries to turn.  Still, it scoots around the floor really well, and if you just turn on one motor and let it spin for a bit, it'll eventually go into this crazy 5 hz spin.  I'm lovin it!\r\n\r\nDig it:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T493fRskCPA"
