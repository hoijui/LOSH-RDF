\r
I do like that an iphone case is something everyone recognizes, and pretty much anybody can pop out of a printer and into their lives.  Hooray!\r

First off, this is a work in progress.  I brought my TOM to thanksgiving, and the first thing my relatives wanted to print was an iphone case.  Sadly, I lost a wire on my heating cartridge mid-print, so until my new cartridge comes in next week, I can't say for certain that it works.  \r
\r
That being said, here's a case for the iphone 4s.  It's a two-piece design with a butterfly to hold everything together.  It's kinda picky about the orientation you print it in, so I put everything together in the friendliest orientation.\r
\r
Inventor files are included, in case you want to adjust the design\r
\r
Suggestions are welcome!""" ;
