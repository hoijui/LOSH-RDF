function: "***UPDATE***  We printed this on an UP!, and it's lovely!  I think these is a solid base design for a case.  Now, it needs to be interesting, something better than what you can buy on a shelf.  Hellooooo, meshmixer!\r\n\r\nI do like that an iphone case is something everyone recognizes, and pretty much anybody can pop out of a printer and into their lives.  Hooray!\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------              ---------------------        ----------------------        ----------------\r\nFirst off, this is a work in progress.  I brought my TOM to thanksgiving, and the first thing my relatives wanted to print was an iphone case.  Sadly, I lost a wire on my heating cartridge mid-print, so until my new cartridge comes in next week, I can't say for certain that it works.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, here's a case for the iphone 4s.  It's a two-piece design with a butterfly to hold everything together.  It's kinda picky about the orientation you print it in, so I put everything together in the friendliest orientation.\r\n\r\nInventor files are included, in case you want to adjust the design\r\n\r\nSuggestions are welcome!"
