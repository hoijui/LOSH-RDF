function = "This is the result of a lot of experimentation with printable clamping mechanisms to hold two surfaces together tightly.  This clamp design lets me insert and remove an object (in this case, the reeds for an accordion) and vary the clamping force holding it in place.  I put up a detailed writeup on how to design these togs here:  http://pocketfactory.org/?p=71, and this is really just a companion thing for that writeup.  You're free to print my design, but I put up these designs with the intention of adding another tool to the toolbox of 3D printable mechanisms.\r\n\r\nHappy printing!"
