function: This is a cord holder/keeper for all the various power/USB cords you have running to your laptop. When you need to take your laptop elsewhere, this keeps all your cords in a nice organized place ready for the next time your reconnect. I've created a trough that holds pennies (25 pennies each trough). These weigh the thing down so the cords don't pull the thing off your desktop.
