function: "These are a selection of elements that can be used with the ancient miniature war game rules De Bellis Antiquitatis or the fantasy version, Hordes of the Things.  They may also work with Field of Glory, but I'm not very familiar with that game system.\r\n\r\nThe most current version of these rules can be downloaded from the developers website (http://www.wrg.me.uk/) in the \"History of WRG\" section.  They are planning to release a new version for sale later this year.  \r\n\r\nThese rules are sol as rules only, leaving it to the players to acquire figures from whatever vendor in whatever scale they choose.  So why not just print your own!\r\n\r\nI settled on 10 mm scale after trying 15 mm and 6 mm.  At 15 mm, the resolution limitations of the printer are rather obvious.  At 6 mm...  well, I just wouldn't want to paint 40 little men for one element of troops...  10 mm is a nice compromise and it give a good impression of massed troops.\r\n\r\nSo far I've uploaded 4 of the 16 element types in the game.  I hope to design the rest and upload them soon.  There are a few additional elements in HotT such as dragons and Behemoths that I may or may not tackle, but I encourage anyone interested to jump in and supply their interpretation of these units!"
