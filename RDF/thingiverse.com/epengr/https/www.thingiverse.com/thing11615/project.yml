function: "Here's a set of hexagonal tiles with embossed images of bugs that I created.  When laid out together they almost look like an insect Hive.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I haven't printed these yet myself - an accident clearing a plugged extruder tip turned my 0.4mm into a 0.8mm...  It prints FAST now, but I can't do anything pretty until parts arrive..."
