function: I designed this to make leveling my HBP a little easier. Once everything is installed the level can be adjusted very easily. The HBP can be installed or removed easily also. I have know idea if this will work on the ABP but should work on the acrylic platform. You have to use a 3 point leveling system though, 2 corner adjusters on the front and a straight one in the middle in the rear. If you put corner ones in the rear they may hit the Z rods, or any extensions such as Jetguys brass tube Z extenders.
