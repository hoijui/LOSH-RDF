It works pretty good. Here are a couple of videos on net making if you are interested in trying out a new hobby :)\r

Nets can be used for things other than catching fish :) When I was younger I remember making one to hold our ping pong balls. Well let us know if you make any nets. As soon as I get one made I will posts some pics.""" ;
