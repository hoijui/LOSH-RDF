function: "I was bored one day and remember making nets with my dad when I was younger. He had carved the shuttles from wood back then. I decided to try and make one with my printer. It works pretty good. Here are a couple of videos on net making if you are interested in trying out a new hobby :)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N0_QKVeYcA\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfB1XjhYPP0\r\n\r\nNets can be used for things other than catching fish :) When I was younger I remember making one to hold our ping pong balls. Well let us know if you make any nets. As soon as I get one made I will posts some pics."
