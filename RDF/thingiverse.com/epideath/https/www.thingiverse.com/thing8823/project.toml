function = "This may be a derivative of Jetguys http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6184, not sure, but it was definitely inspired by it.\r\nI don't really like bushings so I will slowly be moving to bearings where ever I can. I liked Jetguys idea and it makes good mechanical sense. But one I didn't really want to modify my ToM permanently with the tubes and I would have to pull it apart more to do that. Two I wanted to get bearings on the Z axis. My first thought was to use a linear bearing and it still may go that way. But this seems to be working from my preliminary tests. I haven't done any hi speed tests or anything of the sort. Just a basic cube.\r\nThis may be a WIP not sure :) we'll have to see how this one works out and see if there are any improvements. If any one else builds this I would really like to know your results. This was designed for the HBP it won't fit with the ABP."
