function = "Chances are, if you've got any sort of collection of 50+ year old 16mm C-mount lenses, you've got a few that don't have lens caps.  The fronts are all different, I can't help you there.  But the back of the lens (the screw-on part) is (hopefully) the same as this cap, otherwise it wouldn't be a C-mount lens.\r\n\r\nThe simple design is simple.   No threads included, just push it or twist it on."
