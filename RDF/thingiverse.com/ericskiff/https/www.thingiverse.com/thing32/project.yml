function: "The other day while hacking at NYC Resistor, I realized I was getting a crick in my neck sitting hunched over at my laptop. I needed some sort of laptop stand to get the screen up higher, and one that I could get my external keyboard under so my computer wasn't too far away. I'd never seen exactly what I was looking for, so I figured I'd whip one up!\r\n\r\nA little while later, with some help from Inkscape and our Lazzzor, I had this laptop stand.\r\n\r\nBecause the stand is made from 3 flat pieces which you can take apart, it's extremely portable and light."
