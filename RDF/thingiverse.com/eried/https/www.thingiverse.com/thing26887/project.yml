function: "Time ago I searched a lot for tutorials or manuals how to make cases for projects. I had a LCD+touch assembly with 3 layers of PCBs and making the case was very hard for me (keeping all the 'virtual' positions of everything of the model) so I gave up that time. After I while I found that making a cuboid representation of your internals really help into making the case! any complex project can be represented by simple shapes and you just make the case on top!  \nHere is the video for the process of making this case: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22wSBw6W1uI (5 min video, 47 mins in real time)  \nAbout the module:  \nThis is just a cheap GPS module from ebay, GTPA010. The datasheet describes 2 interfaces http://screencast.com/t/teY5OC5N9ry, but I bundled both in this board."
