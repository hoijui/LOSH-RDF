function: "This was a derivative art work created at the Metropolitan Museum Makerbot Hackathon.  The experience was incredible.  Elements from the Met collection were incorporated into the piece via Autodesk's 123D Catch.  Support bars were inserted to aid in printing; this aspect might require some adjustment.
