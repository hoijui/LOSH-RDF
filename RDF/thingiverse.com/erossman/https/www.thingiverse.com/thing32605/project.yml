function: Printrbot compatible extruder fan duct and mount. This fan duct primarily cools the hot extruded thread. This ducting provides some additional cooling for the extruder collar/mount as well. Design DOE's and optimizations by me. The wonderful CAD work on these were provided by my friend Eric D., as he is so much faster at CAD work than I am.
