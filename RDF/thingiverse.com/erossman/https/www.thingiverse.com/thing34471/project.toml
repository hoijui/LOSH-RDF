function = "Inspired by the excellent work of member LightningPhil http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15435 , I made some modifications to his design to help add some strength to the vertical sections. Phil's design was re-drawn to print the arms of the stand laying down.\r\n\r\nThe phone version (**S2.stl) fits my Galaxy S2 in it's bulky case.\r\n\r\nThe tablet version(**N7.stl) fits both my wife's iPad2 and my Nexus 7 (both in their respective covers). \r\n \r\n**update** \r\nMore uses I have found for the larger (N7) version: \r\n\r\n- Wireless keyboard stand for tucking the HTPC keyboard away when not in use. \r\n- iPad stand (I have fitted an iPad2 and an iPad mini)\r\n- Cookbook stand"
