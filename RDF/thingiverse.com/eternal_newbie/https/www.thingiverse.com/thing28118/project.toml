Have fun!  \n\nDownload link: http://randmsystems.com/Media/printer/catapult_accessories_b.stl  \n\nThese are accessories and add-ons to the Seej Catapult.  In the combined file, half are from other people, sources attributed.  \n\nThe accessories are as follows:  \nStanding Legs Attachment - As anyone who's printed the catapult notices, the arm hits the ground and may throw aim off a bit. These are just printed out and snapped on the bottom to give it a little bit more height.  They can be removed (front or back) to adjust aim a little.  \n\nStandard Arm: I like to print this as part of the kit, along with another thing which will be posted later. It just feels incomplete without this.   \n\nCup-arm: Wauter made this rather nice cup, and I like it as part of the accessory kit I use.  \n\nHorizontal-Arm: While play-testing Seej, a few of players insisted on trying to use the standard arm to launch a penny sideways, for more surface area.  This was created as an answer to that.  Two pennies can be fitted into it's shaped-bucket.  \n\nDelux Tripple-Arm: Mattbstrong made this one as part of a delux catapult.  While the arm is a bit tight for pennies (Does a good job with dimes), it's too cool to exclude."
