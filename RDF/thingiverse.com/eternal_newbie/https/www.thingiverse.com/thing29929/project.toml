Have fun!\r\nhttp://randmsystems.com/stuff/public.php?service=files&t=97ab3dd20a903c17c8625ef382e78404\r\n\r\nThis is my modified template for printing masonry style bloxen for Seej.  This does more then print 6 at once, and less.  These models are slightly different then the stock-bloxen and are made to correct what I saw as minor problems with the model.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\nThe merlons have been narrowed slightly, this prevents the bloxen from snapping together vertically, which made a fairly difficult to break barrier. \r\nThe holes have been moved slightly as well, allowing the bloxen to stack at 90 degree angles without a overly tight fit. \r\nSome of the bloxen had their merlons removed to allow a flat-top and more asthetic appearence (Also some of us like to put the flags up there!  Bonus points for hitting a flag without hitting the bloxen...)\r\n\r\nRegretably, I have no pictures at this time. But it does turn out pretty cool =)"
