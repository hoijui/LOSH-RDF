This is my modified template for printing masonry style bloxen for Seej.  This does more then print 6 at once, and less.  These models are slightly different then the stock-bloxen and are made to correct what I saw as minor problems with the model.\r
\r
Fixes:\r
The merlons have been narrowed slightly, this prevents the bloxen from snapping together vertically, which made a fairly difficult to break barrier. \r
The holes have been moved slightly as well, allowing the bloxen to stack at 90 degree angles without a overly tight fit. \r
Some of the bloxen had their merlons removed to allow a flat-top and more asthetic appearence (Also some of us like to put the flags up there!  Bonus points for hitting a flag without hitting the bloxen...)\r
\r
Regretably, I have no pictures at this time. But it does turn out pretty cool =)""" ;
