function = "This is a modified OpenSCAD source file that extrudes the original Parametric Vertex Bracket but does not subtract out the two M3 and one M8 holes in the middle of the object. This part prints faster and uses slightly less material. I created it to reduce the total print time on slower Repstraps. The time savings isn't as significant on faster 3D printers."
