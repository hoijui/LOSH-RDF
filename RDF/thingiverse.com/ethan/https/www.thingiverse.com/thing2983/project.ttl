\r
I have a number of small (1U-3U), light-weight rack-mount devices but wanted to be able to mount them in more convenient places than a standard rack.  These rails could be fastened to the underside of a shelf (by selecting a top cap and top hole) or as the corners for a table-top enclosure.  Longer rails (6U+) might be larger than most 3D printers can presently handle, but could be machined out out bar stock or perhaps well-aligned angle bracket on a CNC.""" ;
