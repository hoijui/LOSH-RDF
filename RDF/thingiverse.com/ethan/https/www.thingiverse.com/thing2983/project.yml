function: "This is an OpenSCAD script to generate shapes for NEMA rack rails based on user input.  It was created with 3D printing in mind, but should be usable with CNC.\r\n\r\nI have a number of small (1U-3U), light-weight rack-mount devices but wanted to be able to mount them in more convenient places than a standard rack.  These rails could be fastened to the underside of a shelf (by selecting a top cap and top hole) or as the corners for a table-top enclosure.  Longer rails (6U+) might be larger than most 3D printers can presently handle, but could be machined out out bar stock or perhaps well-aligned angle bracket on a CNC."
