I was one of the lucky ones quick enough to get a prototype Makerbot Watch, and after assembling and programming it, I never have managed to get a case lasercut for it.  I patterned the overall design around the multi-layer wristwatch/pocket watch design included with the Watch entry, but did this one parametrically so I could fiddle with various design aspects.""" ;
