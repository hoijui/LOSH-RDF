function: "I wanted to try one of the many tool holders that hang off of the Makerbot chassis.  The problem is that I have covers over the three openings and I have aspirations to build a canopy over the top.  I decided to design up a holder to sit on my desk and to hook around the opening on the base to keep it in place.  I notched the hook so I could pull it forward.\r\n\r\nThe holder holds two SD cards, my spring loaded needle nose, hex wrenches and a staple puller (great for getting finished parts off of the  HBP)"
