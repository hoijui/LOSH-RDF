function: "This is a case for a PolargraphSD machine.  Which is essentially a arduino mega, with a polarshield stuck on it, and a 2.2\" LCD touchscreen and a pair of stepstick motor drivers stuck on that.  The case consists of five parts.\r\n\r\nThis version has been superseded by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32377 which is for the polarshield v1.1."
