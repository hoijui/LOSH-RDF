function: "A Cufflink of Yoda's Head..... Inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9154 but designed from scratch in Tinkercad. I haven't printed these, so if the length or size of the cross is a little awkward, comment on it and I can fix it.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 3/20/13: I have uploaded a version with a shorter backpart; it has the shorter label in the name. Also, Yoda is proportionally smaller, but has his shoulders instead of just his head."
