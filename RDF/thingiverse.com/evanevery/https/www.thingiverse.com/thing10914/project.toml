function = "A spindle bushing and locking collar which will allow standard filament spindles to be easily mounted on a 1 inch wooden dowel.  Loose enough that the filament spindle will rotate easily (on the bushing) and allow effortless feed to your makerbot.  I suspend my dowel from both ends attached via plastic chain to the ceiling in my shop.  You could also attach a dowel to a stand.  Easy to change spools as well. 2 Bushings and 2 Locking collars required.  Just drive a screw through the hole in each each locking collar to hold them in place.  Unscrew and release one side when its time to change filament."
