    okh:function """I wanted to be able to quickly switch between extruders on my TOM (without having to open up the electronics bay) so I purchased some connectors from Newark Electronics and designed a bracket which could be bolted onto the Z-Axis to hold the connectors.  The tolerance is close enough that some ABS glue will fuse the connector(s) nicely to the bracket for a solid hold.  (The photos here are as mounted on my Acrylic case mod).  Now all I need to do is unscrew the hold down bolts on the extruder and unplug these connectors.  Then plug in the alternate extruder and away we go!  That way I can choose between 3mm, 1.75mm, and/or PLA extrusion without having to get into the electronics bay or disassemble any extruders...\r
\r
The connectors I chose are way oversize (each pin will carry 7 Amps!), and there is nothing particularly brilliant about the design, but I'm uploading this as it fits the mounting holes in my Acrylic Case mod.\r
\r
I put a 12 pin connector on each side of the Z-Axis.  Although I only needed 12 pins total, I wanted to keep the thermocouple and the rest of the wiring separate as the assembly instruction state the thermocouple can be sensitive to interference from the stepper motor wiring.  So I'm only using two wires on the left side and 10 on the right side with lots left over for expansion (lighting, etc).\r
\r
The Newark (www.newark.com) part numbers for the connector parts are as follows:  56H5247 (24 Pin right angle header - cut it down to 12 pins), 18M7877 (12 pin Female Connector Housing), 54H6895 (2 Pin Female Housing), 54H5375 (pins for female connector housing).  You will need to break off and trim the restraining fingers from the right angle header (you don't need them anyway - the connector holds tight on its own).  I expect there is a right angle header without the locking fingers, but the above parts list is what I started with and I know it will fit the bracket...""" ;
