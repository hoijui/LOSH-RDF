    okh:function """Eventorbot! Open source 3D printer. Simple with less materials. Frame is made of a single 4' long, 2 1/2" square tube (16 gauge/1.5mm/.0598" thick, cost: less then $20.00). With the design there is less plastic parts, stronger structure, all wires are hidden, and a more appealing/finish look. The blue print file will get you more familiar with the construction of the unit. The downloadable file is my blue print that I designed and used to build the machine. The accuracy is to the exact of my build.\r

The unit is supposed to resemble a robotic arm with hydraulic tubes. It was designed for prints to be less affected by vibrations. With the 1 solid frame, any vibrations of any axis will cause the other axis to move with it. For example: If the X axis causes a slight vibration/1mm movement to the right, the Z and Y axis will also move that 1mm to the right. This will result in a better print as everything will remain squared.\r

Eventorbot has met its funding goal!\r
\r
Well, I'm speechless and overwhelmed with all the support. I will like to say a BIG thank you for all the support, kind words, and to all the backers. To be able to share and have your interest in something I created is a great feeling. Everyone of you guys have made something that was a big dream become reality. Eventorbot, as a 3D printer is now going to happen! You will have no regrets in owning a Eventorbot, our machine will be a strong contender.\r
