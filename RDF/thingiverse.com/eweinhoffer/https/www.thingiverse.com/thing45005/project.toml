function = "This is a computer dock, inspired by Griffin's Elevator Notebook Stand. I printed the eight parts in PLA and cut seven pieces of Delrin stock for the legs. Using Delrin was probably overkill - this will work with other (cheaper) materials. \r\n\r\nWhen in the dock, the bottom of my 15\" Macbook Pro is a little more than 3.5\" off my desk."
