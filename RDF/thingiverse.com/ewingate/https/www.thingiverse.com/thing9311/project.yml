function: "I built this to stop the coffee grounds from spilling out over the top of my portafilter when I grind coffee into it.  It's designed for a Rancilio Silvia espresso maker but you should be able to resize it to fit almost any basket.  It works surprisingly well.  \r\n\r\nEDIT: I re-printed this after upgrading my printer and found that the fit was a bit tight.  To fix it I put the portafilter basket in the oven (200C ish) and then pushed the ring into it.  Perfect fit."
