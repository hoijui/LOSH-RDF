function = "Plastic collar to wrap around front/rear magnets on Brio style toy trains.  \n\nDesign is based on the style used by Thomas and Brio brand trains, with the base of the cup between the magnet and the train.  \n\nIf you really want to produce an over-magnet version similar to what the BigJigs brand uses, just call magnet_collar(false).  However, by placing a layer of plastic between the magnet and nail head, you considerably diminish the magnet's ability to hold your train cars together.  \n\nMeasurements are based on parts from Cherry Tree Toys.  \n\n * magnet: http://www.cherrytreetoys.com/Ceramic-Magnet-P3616.aspx  \n * nail:   http://www.cherrytreetoys.com/Nickel-Plated-Round-Head-Nail-P6052.aspx  \n\nNote that they changed suppliers and the nails you receive will not be barbed like the one in the photo.  \n\nFind the latest versions of this and other related designs at https://github.com/ex-nerd/3d"
