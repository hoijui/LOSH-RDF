function: "Sparkfun sells an OBD2 connector ( http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9911 ) that is very useful for those wanting to connect their car to their mighty Arduino. (They also sell OBD2 to DB9 cables, but where's the fun in that?) ;-)\r\n\r\nBut once you've finished soldering, you'll want to protect those shiny bits from dust and smoke. That's what this cover is for."
