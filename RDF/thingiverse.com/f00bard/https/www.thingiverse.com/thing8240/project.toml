function = "This board holds a couple of RJ45 jacks and connects the pins to carry power and i2c signals between the ports.  This is for the Sensing Platform located at http://sensingplatform.org/.  The layout was designed to minimize vias, and so that the traces for the RJ45 jacks are located on the bottom of the board so that through plating isn't necessary."
