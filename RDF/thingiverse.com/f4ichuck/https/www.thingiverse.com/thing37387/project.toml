function = "This kit redirects the motherboard cooling intake to the side of the machine to draw in cool air instead of warm air from inside the printer.  This works with the $15 Replicator Enclosure.  Or, optionally download the manifold with no flange for a cleaner looking intake port.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will save some voltage regulators from failing."
