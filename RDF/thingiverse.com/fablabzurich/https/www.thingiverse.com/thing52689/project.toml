function = "This is a model of the mystical place in the long-gone city of Sworva that has been destroyed during the last ice age. The pyramid in the center glowed periodically in the sun and the priests of Sworva used it as a calendar. Normal people could not access the pit with the pyramid and the circular steps were infested with terrible creatures such as poisonous pigs, electrical snakes and singing plants.\r\n\r\nMade by Alessandro @ Fab Lab Zurich"
