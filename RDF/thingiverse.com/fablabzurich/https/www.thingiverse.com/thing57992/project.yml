function: "Have you ever tried to germinate seeds in your own private urban premises? If yes, you might remember the hassle with ugly brittle plastic pseudo-greenhouses and difficult to handle soil and pots. Here is the solution! A beautiful and sturdy desktop greenhouse with a highly convenient seedling handling system. It comes with a pot press for creating temporary soil packages made of newspaper. When the seelings are big enough, they can be easily taken out from the greenhouse and planted directly with the pot, as the paper will quickly decompose. \r\n\r\nThe perfect thing for urban gardening, recycling and DIY!\r\n\r\nMade by Alessandro @ Fab Lab Zurich"
