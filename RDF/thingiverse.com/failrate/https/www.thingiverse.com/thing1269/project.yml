function: "\"Plumber's Pipe\" v.0.1\r\nBased on the invention of Mark Shepard (http://www.markshep.com/flute/Pipe.html)\r\nIt\xE2\u20AC\u2122s in the key of G and plays two full octaves.\r\n\r\nWell, does it?  I don't know.  Mark's original version is made with PVC tubing and sounds all right.  I've tried to recreate his dimensions using openSCAD in order to learn how to use that tool (so far, so good).\r\n\r\nNote: Sadly, discovered that the .scad file was not the version I thought I had.  openSCAD saves using F2, not Ctrl-S.  A painful lesson.  .scad file removed."
