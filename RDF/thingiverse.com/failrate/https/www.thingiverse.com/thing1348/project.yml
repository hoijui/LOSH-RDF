function: "Taking a cue from all of the lovely gears appearing on thingiverse recently, I sat down with openSCAD and figured out once and for all how to use rotate and translate together to make gears.\r\n\r\nThe result is a reasonably typical music box cylinder with adjustable tooth and braille count.  This version is probably not well formed for MakerBots, but could be sintered.  I have an idea for a MakerBot version, but it's running late ;)\r\n\r\n\\todo: \r\n  - Accompanying worm gear (or spring, clutch, drive gear assembly?)\r\n  - Comb\r\n  - Base/Box"
