function = "Based on the pickups in a Gibson Epiphone.  Sadly, I don\\'t think it could be MakerBotted, unless it was done in two pieces.  It\\'s intended to be laser-cut in layers out of cardboard.\r\n\r\nOf course, real bobbins are dirt cheap (about 2.50 USD), but the .scad file can be hacked to make custom bobbins (super-large, super-small, different magnet counts, etc.).\r\n\r\nNot yet tested."
