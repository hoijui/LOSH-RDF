function = "This design is based on a portable backpacker acoustic and a toy cardboard guitar for children.  Its intent is to explore whether cardboard can be strong enough to withstand the stresses of a guitar string while flexible enough to produce an attractive musical tone.\r\n\r\nI would also like to see if it's possible to make a flatpack version in pine sheets, but I would need to make a wood steamer first.\r\n\r\nThis is an entry into the Make/Makerbot contest :)"
