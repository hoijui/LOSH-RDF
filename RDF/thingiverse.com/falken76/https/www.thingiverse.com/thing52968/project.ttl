This was constructed on the Ipad Mini retail packaging.  There was a battery compartment in the area behind the feet that held a battery that powered blinking LEDS on the side panels.  I just thought it looked awesome and figured I'd share it with you all in case you would like to print one up for yourselves.  Enjoy" ;
