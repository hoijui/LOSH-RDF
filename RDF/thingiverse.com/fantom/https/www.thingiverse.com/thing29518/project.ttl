This is scale model of the Minecraft Creeper, made of a few parts for easy and reliable printing.  

Under the covers it's a relatively minor rework of the creeper found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8346   

Changes are:  
 - Increased the depth of the toes, making their size a parameter  
 - Deepened the holes for the face, made the depth a parameter  
 - Parameterised the creation of the connecting holes for the legs.  It's possible to print the body & legs as a single piece.  
 - Flipped the Z axis, so that it's up the right way in the scad file  
 - Cleaned the scad file a bit for readability, reused code for legs/toes
