function: "Find me now at  http://goo.gl/qfeRmZ  \n\nThis is scale model of the Minecraft Creeper, made of a few parts for easy and reliable printing.  \n\nUnder the covers it's a relatively minor rework of the creeper found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8346   \n\nChanges are:  \n - Increased the depth of the toes, making their size a parameter  \n - Deepened the holes for the face, made the depth a parameter  \n - Parameterised the creation of the connecting holes for the legs.  It's possible to print the body & legs as a single piece.  \n - Flipped the Z axis, so that it's up the right way in the scad file  \n - Cleaned the scad file a bit for readability, reused code for legs/toes  \n\nThe Steve in the photo is thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29570  \n\nDesign removed and replaced with the flat disk you see, feel free to email for the original if you want it.  See following link for details http://traverseda.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/makerbot-blatently-steals-and-patents-a-community-design/   \n\nFor alternatives to thingiverse see http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/26do2z/alternative_repositories_to_thingiverse/"
