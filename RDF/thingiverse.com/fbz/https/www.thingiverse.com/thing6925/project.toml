function = "this is a belt loom to make on a cnc router. i coded the gcode by hand since it was just a series of simple straight lines and drilled holes. this was made at DingFabrik in Cologne, Germany. i made this out of 4mm plywood on an A4 sized sheet, but it could easily be made out of acrylic or a different thickness of plywood."
