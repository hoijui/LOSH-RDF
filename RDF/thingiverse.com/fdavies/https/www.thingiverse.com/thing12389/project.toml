function = "Building on the power cord support by foxdewayen, I have made a nice way to mount an AC power switch on my mendel.  Note that my mendel is a little wider than the standard plan, so there is more room for this piece.\r\n\r\nThe switch came from an old copy machine, so I do not have a part number for it.\r\n\r\nI have included a blank version in case someone wants to use a different switch."
