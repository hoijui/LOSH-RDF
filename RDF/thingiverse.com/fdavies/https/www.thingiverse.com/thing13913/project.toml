function = "The original clamp (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13228) held the M8 nut too tightly (probably due to poor print quality) and this created binding that my stepper motor could not overcome.\r\n\r\nThis modification does not hold the nut as tightly and can be installed without disassembling a lot of stuff.  This means that the nut can wiggle slightly rather than the X axis end piece wiggling."
