function = "A pair of these will hold a 26 cm spool above a Mendel using a 8mm smooth or threaded rod as an axle.  They are kind of long (~195 mm), and work best with PLA.\r\n\r\nThe supported spool is more stable if the two supports are tilted toward each other.\r\n\r\nI was going to make clamps to hold the supports to the top pair of rods on the mendel, but it turned out that the weight of the spool was sufficient."
