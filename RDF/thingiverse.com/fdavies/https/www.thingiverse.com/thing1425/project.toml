function = "This is the next step in my attempt to make a Sarrus linkage based 3D printer.  The idea is to have a cartesian mechanism without those long rods and bearings.\r\n\r\nI built three of the Mark III and mounted them in a x-y arrangement as shown.  They can move over a square about 105 mm wide, and someday may carry an extruder.  They are driven by DC motors taken from inkjet printers.  These motors are driven in a servo arrangement using quadrature optical encoders and optical strips removed from the same printers."
