function = "This is my first attempt at a Sarrus linkage suitable for a Z axis.  It has room for a skate bearing, 10-32 threaded rod, and 10-32 nut to drive it.  In practice, this mechanism is not quite stiff enough for good printing, but it might be useful for other things.\r\n\r\nThe total range of movement is just over 100 mm."
