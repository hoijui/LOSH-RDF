function = "This luggage tag is designed to fit a standard business card, but maybe your business is non-standard!  So of course you can customize it to fit whatever type of card you want.  It's a 2 piece print that bolts together at the corners and the pressure clamps the card in.  And just for fun it has an open-source hardware logo cutout in the back."
