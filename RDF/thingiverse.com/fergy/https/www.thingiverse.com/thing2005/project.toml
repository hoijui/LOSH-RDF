function = "SMALdog is a walking robot, using 13 AX-12 servos, that I am currently configuring to compete in the Trinity Fire Fighting contest. This is his new head, printed on a Makerbot.\r\n\r\nThe head is a single printed part, to which 2 IR sensors, a sonar ranger, an IR photodiode (for detecting the flame), and the ducted fan (for extinguishing the candle) are all mounted. It connects to an AX-12 servo, which allows it to pan. \r\n\r\nHis buildlog can be found on my blog, http://www.showusyoursensors.com"
