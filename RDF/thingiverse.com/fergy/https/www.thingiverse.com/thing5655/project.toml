function = "Issy is a walking robot, using 14 AX-12 servos and 2 hobby servos for the neck. His legs, head and tail were printed on a Makerbot\r\n\r\nThe head consists of two parts: the camera holder and snout.\r\n\r\nEach leg consists of a foot-pad, insert, and frame. Additionally, each leg requires a spring (P/N coming shortly -- need to find the wrapper), 6-32x1-1/2\" machine screw, and a tiny piece of metal for the switch (I used flashing). \r\n\r\nIssy's build log can be found on my blog, showusyoursensors.com"
