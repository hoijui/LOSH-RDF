function: "Majora's mask from Majora's Mask.  \r\nTried to be as true to the original artwork as possible.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nScaled mask to wearable size.  Should be close to \"lifesized\".\r\nAdded Left and Right Halves with separate horns.  Halves are sized and designed to fit on a makerbot replicator 2.  Halves should print without support.  Horns will need supports.\r\nTwo alternatives exists one with open tear ducts so the wearer can see and the other with solid tearducts for hanging on a wall."
