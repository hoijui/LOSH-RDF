function = "This is an EVA Extruder based on a wade plastic extruder and that use a hot glue gun heater and his 12mm diameter stick (8mm on study).\r\n\r\nIt fits instead of a wade extruder on a prusa mendel.\r\n\r\nWith this I could extrude soft part made of EVA.\r\n\r\nThis design is still on modification, stay tuned.\r\n\r\nBE CAREFULL : the hot gun heater is plugged on 220V, prefer using your hot-end heater/controller block."
