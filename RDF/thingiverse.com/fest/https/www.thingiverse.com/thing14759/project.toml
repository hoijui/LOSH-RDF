function = "I had a 60mm fan on hand, and wanted to use it to cool parts while printing.\r\nThis mounting bracket uses 2 standard RepRap Prusa PLA bushings, which are glued to mounting bracket.\r\n\r\nFan size and other parameters can be adjusted in .scad file. Most likely you will only need to change fan width and fan screw offset.\r\n\r\nSTL file is compiled for 60mm fan.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if one fan will be enough to cool the part (as the flow of air will only come from one side, the other side may warp), but you can always print a second mount on the opposite side of X axis."
