    okh:function """Case for Raspberry Pi.\r
Derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24945 but with dimensions that fit my Raspbery Pi more accurately.\r
Wanted to clarify- there were several things I modified:\r
1) Merged lincomatic's version with latest from Hans.\r
2) Made the micro USB power connector hole about millimeter taller- otherwise it didn't quite fit.\r
3) Shaved 0.5mm off from wall which is next to GPIO hole- otherwise it did not fit next to GPIO pins (the pins themselves did fit, but pins have a wider base).\r
4) also, moved SD card hole a bit. Card reader was in a way of case otherwise.\r
5) Made the case mating walls longer- otherwise they break too easy.""" ;
