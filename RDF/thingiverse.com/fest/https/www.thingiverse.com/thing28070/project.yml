function: "Case for Raspberry Pi.\r\nDerived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24945 but with dimensions that fit my Raspbery Pi more accurately.\r\nWanted to clarify- there were several things I modified:\r\n1) Merged lincomatic's version with latest from Hans.\r\n2) Made the micro USB power connector hole about millimeter taller- otherwise it didn't quite fit.\r\n3) Shaved 0.5mm off from wall which is next to GPIO hole- otherwise it did not fit next to GPIO pins (the pins themselves did fit, but pins have a wider base).\r\n4) also, moved SD card hole a bit. Card reader was in a way of case otherwise.\r\n5) Made the case mating walls longer- otherwise they break too easy."
