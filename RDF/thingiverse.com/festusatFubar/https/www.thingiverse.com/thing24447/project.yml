function: Nicer way to use Makerbot Industries filament spools in the BFB3000 family of printers. I originally made a sleeve that fit over the spool holders of the BFB but this proved to have too little friction and the filament would unwind itself and tangle. These provide about the right amount of friction so the filament will not unwind itself.
