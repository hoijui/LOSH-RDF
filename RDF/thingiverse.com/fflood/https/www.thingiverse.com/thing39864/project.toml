Just print more runners when the original runners get worn down.\r\n\r\nMy son asked if it would be possible to print a hockey puck and I didn't want to waste the plastic on an average solid puck. I told him that we could design a  puck specifically for roller hockey that would allow the puck to glide across the surface on runners. We drew it up in Rhino and printed the puck and runners in PLA on our Prusa V2."
