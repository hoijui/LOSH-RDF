\r
The goal is to have it print the outline of the object first, and then have it print the connecting lines, one at a time, so that we could measure what the necessary early startup and shutdown distances will be.\r
\r
I have yet to achieve this goal, and am asking the thingiverse community for help.\r
\r
Included are the original Solid Works file and an stl file.""" ;
