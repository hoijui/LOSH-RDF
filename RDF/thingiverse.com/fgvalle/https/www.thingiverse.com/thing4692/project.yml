function: "This is my first attempt at making a file that will aid in oozebane calibration.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to have it print the outline of the object first, and then have it print the connecting lines, one at a time, so that we could measure what the necessary early startup and shutdown distances will be.\r\n\r\nI have yet to achieve this goal, and am asking the thingiverse community for help.\r\n\r\nIncluded are the original Solid Works file and an stl file."
