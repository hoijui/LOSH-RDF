\r
I made these because I moved my electronics board but did not want the ToM to continue to sit on the bare wood. They raise it up ~1/2" (14mm) and have an overall height of ~1" (24mm). They were not designed to be used if your board is in place... but this has been modified in the para_foot.scad file so you can generate versions that will work just fine.\r
\r
I prefer to make everything able to be manipulated and I used OpenSCAD so you will find a number of parameters to control the size of these parts. Right now it is designed to provide 5.6mm wide channels that are 10mm deep, which is the width of the laser cut panels used on these devices (and should work for Cupcakes also) while providing a good depth for stability (which can be changed as you desire also).\r
\r
The Thingomatic Feet by deltagear was an inspiration but I wanted something a bit smaller, that did not need to be rescaled and that I could reuse for other things. A single foot takes about 30 minutes to print.\r
\r
Updated 9/23/2011:\r
I made some slight changes to clean up the .scad files as well as provided a second set labeled "feet". This provides for all four corners with just a single file.\r
\r
Updated 10/1/2011:\r
I added a new file para_foot.scad. All future improvements will be based off this version. Right now it is still designed for ToMs (I have a posting in their forums asking for pictures and measurements for CupCakes and anything else but nobody has provided any). It is much more configurable though and even allows for the electronics board to still be mounted in the bay (with some of the parametrics. Give it a try if you want.""" ;
