function = "This is a nametag that can be hung on the edge of your device. It is highly parametric and I tried to comment much of it to make it relatively easy to manipulate. By default it is set for the average thickness of plywood you could expect with a MakerBot product.\r\n\r\nThis object was inspired by jetty's thing # 14745 and uses the font set created by avrgeek which is thing # 6820. You will need the thing # 6820 font files to be able to use this object.\r\n\r\nOne thing some people might find useful is the rounded cube I made for  this. It uses a pretty simple method and should be easy enough to copy into your own project once you understand how it is using the variables.\r\n\r\nI did not include any support in the base object so someone could add it in or use whatever options their printing software allows for."
