    okh:function """This is a nametag that can be hung on the edge of your device. It is highly parametric and I tried to comment much of it to make it relatively easy to manipulate. By default it is set for the average thickness of plywood you could expect with a MakerBot product.\r
\r
This object was inspired by jetty's thing # 14745 and uses the font set created by avrgeek which is thing # 6820. You will need the thing # 6820 font files to be able to use this object.\r
\r
One thing some people might find useful is the rounded cube I made for  this. It uses a pretty simple method and should be easy enough to copy into your own project once you understand how it is using the variables.\r
\r
I did not include any support in the base object so someone could add it in or use whatever options their printing software allows for.""" ;
