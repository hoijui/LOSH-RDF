function = "This RepRap Power Ring can be set to use \"standard\" ring sizes for around the world. Instead of having to enter the specific measurement you can simply select your region (there are 4 available) and then enter the ring size appropriate for that region.\r\n\r\nSo if you need a size 13 ring in the US, then the first parameter would be 0 (setting the region) and the second would be 13 (setting the size). There are 3 other parameters for things like thickness, depth of the logo, and whether the edges are beveled or not.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The .stl is just a sample that creates a ring in the US/Canada size of 13. To set your own size edit the OpenSCAD file, render, and export your own .stl."
