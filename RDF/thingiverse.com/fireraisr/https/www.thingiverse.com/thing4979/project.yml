function: "First off, I did not create this. It was designed by the Fleming Bros and released in Alibre format. I have only imported their file into Pro/Engineer and converted it to stl. I believe this is a more common format and will facilitate people being able to print or cnc it easier. \r\n\r\nFor those that aren't aware, the Isaac Mendel is designed to be easily manufactured on either a 3D printer or a CNC Mill. It uses fewer parts than a traditional Mendel. However, with the release of the new Prusa Mendel it is no longer the easiest to print. Still it is a great design and hopefully these files will serve you well.\r\n\r\nI have recieved permission to publish these files from the original authors and am releasing them under the GPLv3 as was the original design.\r\n\r\nIf you have a printer and print this out please post some pics as mine is not finished yet.\r\nThanks and happy printing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added a zip file with all the parts for easier downloading.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: It has come to my attention that many of these files are dimensioned incorrectly. I'll be updating this as soon as I can correct the issue but for now be sure to double check the scaling on anything you try to print."
