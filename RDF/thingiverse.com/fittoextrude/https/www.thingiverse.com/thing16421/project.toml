function = "This thing is a derivative of\r\nthe v2 X carriage found on the Github/Makergear/file repository. This design is  modified to fit LM8UU bearings. This x carriage fits a Makergear extruder or bowden cable adapter.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Xnaron's \"snap in holder\" design for inspiration.  The carriage should fit a regular Prusa Mendel as well.\r\n\r\nI have included the Alibre design file for those who have access to this program."
