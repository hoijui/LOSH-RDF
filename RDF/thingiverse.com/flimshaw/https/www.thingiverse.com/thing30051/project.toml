function = "This is a bracket to use a standard RadioShack Roller Switch as a homing switch on a CupcakeCNC.  It is also, of course, printable on one.  Requires one small hole drilled in the cupcake, then an M3 nut and bolt allow for easy adjustment.  Seems to work pretty well, just doing initial tests now."
