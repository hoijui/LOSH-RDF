    okh:function "So you go into the hardware store and you look around at all the cool things that used to cost so much before you had a 3D printer. This is one of the most useful items I found that we can make. In the store they can cost between $.75-$4 for a nylon version, depending on the size of the nut. I took it upon myself to CAD up some to make ABS nuts. These are real handy when you are creating a Mendel and don't want to hurt yourself on the bolt heads. They are in the US standard sizes, since this is the cheapest materials I have available to me right now. I encourage others to make metric versions." ;
