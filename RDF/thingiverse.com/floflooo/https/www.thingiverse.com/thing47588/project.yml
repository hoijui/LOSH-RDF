function: This is a custom cable holder that I made for my bike and that can hold up to 4 cables. My bike, an Avanti Torrent, came with cable holders that held 3 cables. I got a seatpost dropper with remote and needed the possibility to rout a fourth cable. I thus designed a cable holder that could hold 4 cables. I have printed and field tested this design. In case you're wondering, it is to be attached on the downside of the downtube.
