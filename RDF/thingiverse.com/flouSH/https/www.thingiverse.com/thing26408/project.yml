function: "This is a simple mini servo coupling which connects a \"mini series\" RC servo to a 4mm rod.\r\n\r\nI was absolutely happy to see that this insane detail is printed with ease on my Ultimaker!\r\n\r\nThis coupling features a tiny hole for a M2 screw which secures the coupling towards the servo. Another hole is there to fix the rod (where you have to drill a tiny hole into) to the coupling.\r\n\r\nSee a video of the use case as well as more close-up photos here: https://plus.google.com/116416453568555193309/posts/4a1KFqxNY9A\r\n\r\nI tried different slicers which gave quite different results due to different threshold values for small details I guess.\r\n\r\nThe coupling will be used in a flying object which I will release very soon - ready to print of course! Follow me on Google+ or watch for it on Thingiverse."
