function = "I just felt like throwing together something that would be impossible to manufacture with traditional injection molding. I'm sure someone else has done something like this before but I'm just messing around with this new toy.\r\n\r\nUPDATE, 4 years later: I made the thing and its pegs thicker, to address some fragility problems. Of course there's also the customizable version that someone else remixed from this, if you just want to do that."
