function: "UPDATED 6/1/2013: I tweaked the files a little bit more to make it a bit more durable, as I was having trouble with the top-flange and attachment clips cracking apart.  \n\nOkay, so I really like the Kr\xC3\xA4us KPF-1612 faucet (available at  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032IPJ0I among other places), so much so that this is the second kitchen in a row that I've owned where I've installed one.  It's a great faucet, with a great design and a lot of utility.  \n\nExcept for two problems.  \n\n1. The swing-arm is a little bit short.  \n\n2. When the spray-head is mounted, it only points straight up and down, when it would be nice if it had a bit of an angle on it. This would especially make it easier for cleaning larger pots or just generally having a bit more flexibility in using it.  \n\nAt one point I contacted Kr\xC3\xA4us asking if they had any sort of accessory clip to make the spray head adjustable, with a hint-hint-wouldn't-this-be-nice? tone to it, but their only response was that they didn't make accessory parts.  \n\nSo I made one.  \n\nThis is the third major version, which I'm pretty happy with (after a LOT of tinkering). I'm considering sending it as an engineering sample to Kr\xC3\xA4us so that they can actually make this themselves to vastly improve their product."
