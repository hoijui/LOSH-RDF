function: Yeah, yeah, it's been done before, but I decided to try my take on a turner's cube.  This one lets you specify the size of the outermost cube and the minimum thickness of the "bridges" between the corners, and it will generate a turner's cube with the maximum number of levels possible for it.  (Set the thickness to 0 if you want your computer to have a really bad day.)
