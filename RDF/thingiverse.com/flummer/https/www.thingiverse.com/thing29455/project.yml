function: "This is a stamp and handle that I have made for the hackerspace Labitat (http://labitat.dk), so that we can stamp hackerspace passports (https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Passport) when we have visitors to the space.\r\n\r\nI have printed it out in two pieces, the black handle has been printed in regular PLA and the grey stamp pad has been printed in the special flexible PLA type, purchased from the Ultimaker, but I have seen in in other shops too."
