function = "There are countless Z-Coupling for 3D-Printer: rigid, flexible, printable and other variations. I'm using the Slim-Z-Coupling for a couple of weeks and I thought it's mature to propose this solution.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Slim and light.\r\n- No need of screws.\r\n- The Slim-Z-Coupling is rigid in the radial but flexible int axial-direction.\r\n- Easy to build with simple tools.\r\n- Using the Z-Support-Bracket ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52388 ) you can reduce the force on the motor-shaft.\r\n- It reduces the Z-Axis-Wobble (additionally I recommend http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42260 or a similar solution).\r\n\r\nUpdate: Slim-Z-Coupling2.tiff (white background)"
