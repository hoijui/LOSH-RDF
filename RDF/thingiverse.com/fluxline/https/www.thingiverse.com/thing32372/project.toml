function = "A switch mounting bracket for the z-height switch.  GeneralRulofDumb's concept for easing the adjustment of the z-height is great, I like having the adjustment inside the machine.  The ones outside interfered with my filament spool, and I had to remove them for transport.  But, I did not like the idea of drilling a hole in the frame.  So this is a bracket to mount the switch to the existing slots using one of the mounting holes from the switch and another in the bracket for the switch.  Both holes have a recessed nut to secure the switch and bracket to the frame.  Also, it is not need to remove the leaf-spring of the end-switch."
