function = "This is a mounting for the Ultimaker to fit the Heavy duty printable filament spool, thing  thingiverse.com/thing:10219.  It attaches to the back, left, top frame bolt.  It also has a printed thread cap to make it easy to change spools.  The spacer not only allows the spool to sit away from the frame but you can also just print a different size for other spool types, there is also a shorter version to mount 2 spools.  \n\n02.11.12:  Updated mount to fit rod better  \n09.11.12:  Added a holder for filamant shipped with spools, there is also a longer rod to hold these fat spools, both plastic and cardboard  \n16.12.12: Some have issues with reel hitting motor, made it longer by 50mm to increase clearance.  Would be helpful if someone could confirm this fixes the problem. Listed as Fluxline_Spool_mount_V2.stl  \n__02.04.13: Some had issues with some filament spools hitting the extruder.  I have added a new, V3 spool mount that shifts the rod more the side giving about as much clearance as you can have.__"
