function: "I wanted to make a No Solicitor sign so I gave the generator (from which this is derived).  The resulting file lacked several features I wanted.  These are the result of the effort.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER! There is a problem found in SCAD or the file that I lack understanding of how to resolve.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"
