function = "My WD TV Live Hub is taking up desk space and is not in the intuitive place when pointing the remote so I am going to hang it from behind my monitor using 2 of these brackets.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Work in progress and I have yet to print (the pin causes a challenge unless supported.)\r\n\r\nCode is not very clean yet and is not really correctly parameterizable - BUT... It is close to what I want.  Will print it in a bit.\r\n\r\nAdded a pic of my first trials.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Added roundedBox and new pic"
