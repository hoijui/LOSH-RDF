function = "I was considering creating a business card with scad and my 3d printer.  I wanted to have text \"differenced\" from the stock card (basically thru-hole text.)\r\n\r\nHowever, initial attempts using the write.scad module have resulted in only the ability to have text emboss.\r\n\r\nSo, here is an example of the product of my first trial.\r\n\r\nIt lacks a lot of elegance like auto placement, adjusting for text length, and definitely no kerning.  But it was interesting as a learning effort.  \r\n\r\nI cannot get the smaller text to actually print using SFACT. A multitude of setting changes have resulted in sparse fill/outline.  \r\n\r\nSuggestions are desired for resolving the problems or improvements."
