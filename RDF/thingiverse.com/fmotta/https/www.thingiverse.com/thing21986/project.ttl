    okh:function """I was considering creating a business card with scad and my 3d printer.  I wanted to have text "differenced" from the stock card (basically thru-hole text.)\r
\r
However, initial attempts using the write.scad module have resulted in only the ability to have text emboss.\r
\r
So, here is an example of the product of my first trial.\r
\r
It lacks a lot of elegance like auto placement, adjusting for text length, and definitely no kerning.  But it was interesting as a learning effort.  \r
\r
I cannot get the smaller text to actually print using SFACT. A multitude of setting changes have resulted in sparse fill/outline.  \r
\r
Suggestions are desired for resolving the problems or improvements.""" ;
