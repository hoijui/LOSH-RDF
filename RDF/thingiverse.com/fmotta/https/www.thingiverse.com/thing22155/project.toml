function = "I wanted to use the lift kit V2. \r\n\r\nBut, I found:\r\n1) I didn't have the bolts long enough to use V2(I have several 30MM bolts though)\r\n2) The 46MM additional height results in it being considerably above the vertex.  So, I doubt I can find a way to gain from the additional 8MM height I removed.\r\n\r\nThis is now more parameterizable than V2.\r\n\r\nAlmost a complete rewrite.\r\n\r\nNOTE: 02:20AM PST - fixed error in handling a block too small"
