\r
I also had at least 5 people ask me how to do this. So, here we are - now I can point here.\r
\r
I had an IdeaCenter attached to the back of one of my monitors that I was no longer using as a NAS and was tired of configuring every stinking computer I used to 3d print, swap the USB cable, blah... blah...\r
\r
So, I used the IdeaCenter as a printer station and accessing it via VNC.""" ;
