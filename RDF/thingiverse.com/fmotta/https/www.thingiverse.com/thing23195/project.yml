function: "Less of a \"Thing\" and more of instructions for setting up VNC-based 3d-printer station.\r\n\r\nI also had at least 5 people ask me how to do this. So, here we are - now I can point here.\r\n\r\nI had an IdeaCenter attached to the back of one of my monitors that I was no longer using as a NAS and was tired of configuring every stinking computer I used to 3d print, swap the USB cable, blah... blah...\r\n\r\nSo, I used the IdeaCenter as a printer station and accessing it via VNC."
