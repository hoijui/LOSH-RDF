function = "This is a bracket to hold a depth gauge to the extruder head of an ultimaker 3d printer. This allows easy and quick levelling of the build table.  The bracket is sized to fit a gauge I found in a box of junk in my loft. The gauge measures deflection to an accuracy of 1/1000 of an inch, so in theory I can get my build table that level. In practice, I probably get 1/200 of an inch, but that's easily accurate enough to improve my prints."
