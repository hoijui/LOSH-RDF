function: "I printed pit3k's bowden clamp and I experienced some difficulties to pass the filament through the riser. I made a subtle change on the riser hole which guides the filament through on the nut part. Now the nut has a conical hole and just 5 mm before the top it extends to fit the tightening ring into it.\r\n\r\nI also made a countersink on the bottom on the riser after the print by using a countersink tool (I tried to create this countersink directly in the model but it fails to print on a heated bed, even when raft was switched on).\r\n\r\nI also recommend to do another countersink on you bowden tube too.\r\n\r\nFinally, I printed chopmeister's great H3 feeder unit and tried to install this bowden clamp in it.  It was OK, except that the riser was a bit loose so I made a small tightening nut too to fix this.\r\n\r\nModified OpenSCAD source attached."
