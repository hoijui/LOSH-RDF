function: This is a smaller version of the filament drive made by Jag. I made this from scratch in Sketchup, but based most of it around his design, because the larger 3mm version worked well. This, and the 1.75 settings were all I needed to immediately get the thinner plastic working. Requires no extra support, they are built into the model.
