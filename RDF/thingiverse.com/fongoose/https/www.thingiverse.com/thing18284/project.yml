function: Design for 3D artist magazine competition. Create a printable pet monster. I've always been fascinated with monsters/ creatures since I was a young whippersnapper. I ended up going for the imp/ gargoyle sort of design. I chose this design for the challenge of adding just enough detail for the muscle tone and facial features to come through in the final print. After experimenting with all sorts of poses and structures I decided to use a tucked position. This enabled me to model the full being in a fairly natural pose without having to split him up into bits. I wanted a clean, solid model with no nasty joints/ gaps etc. I was worried about overhanging sections of the model  and the possibility some parts sagging during printing (the hands in particular) but it turned out alright in the final print. Pleased with it :)
