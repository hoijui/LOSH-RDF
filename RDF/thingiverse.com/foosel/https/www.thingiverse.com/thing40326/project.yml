function: "**Note**: This is thing is not maintained on here any more, further development/support it will happen on its [Youmagine page](https://www.youmagine.com/designs/organizer-thingy-for-blackboard-chalk-or-anything-else-cylindrical).  \n----  \nMy mother (who's a teacher) keeps her personal stash of blackboard chalk in a small container. In the past she had the problem that the chalk could freely rotate and fall around in that container, which led to some broken pieces and a lot of chalk dust. When I introduced her to my newly acquired 3d printer, she immediately thought of this specific problem and we designed a solution for it, a thing to use as a organizing part between the layers in her box to keep the pieces in place."
