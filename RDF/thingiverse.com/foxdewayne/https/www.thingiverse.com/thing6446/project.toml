function = "I added Revars LCD mod http://wiki.makerbot.com/revarlcd-assembly to my cupcake and love it. After serching for a way to enclose my LCD and Keypad, I decided to make my own. So this is what I came up with. I hope others can use it as well. I highly recommend adding this mod to all makerbots. Not only does it allow you to print without a computer hooked up to your bot but it will only cost you about $70.00 to build."
