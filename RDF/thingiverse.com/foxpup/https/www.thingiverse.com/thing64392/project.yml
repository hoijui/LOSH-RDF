function: With Easter cominig and my desire to share the goodness of 3D printing with my friends, I thought it would be good to print a bunch of bunnies and give them out, putting one in the hand of everyone I know.  This is a bold-faced copy of the gpvillamil's Tron Bunny at 30% Scale and arranged tightly in a 10x8 matrix.  The whole group fits nicely on a Mendell size build platform.  This bunny has simple geometry which works well for shrinking and massive replication.  The original Stanford Bunny shunk and duplicated like this made SlicEr curl up and die.  This simple bunny works nicely, however, even when there are 80 of them.  It was a bit of a struggle making the best of this and I figured, why not let others benefit from my efforts. :-)
