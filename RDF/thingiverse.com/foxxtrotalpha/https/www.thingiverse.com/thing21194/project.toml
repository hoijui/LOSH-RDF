function = "The soldering assistant is a project idea I had to have my soldering supplies conveniently in one spot. The Solder spool holder is close to the work area to have a ready supply of solder to feed directly from the spool. The soldering assistant also features and adjustable vise to hold your projects securely as you assemble them. Just behind the work area is a parts bin, to put your resistors, capacitors, IC's tweezers or other supplies. Side \"fins\" make it possible to make custom add-ons that can just snap into place.  The only part that isn't printable through a 3d printer is the center threaded rod that moves the base, this is a 1/4\" threaded rod that can be purchased at any local hardware store. 2 hex nuts are also required, one that fits into the moving side of the platform, and one on the stationary side. An update will soon be done, addition to the design will be a fume extractor and adjustable angle for the vice platform. This is an entry for the \"Make it real Challenge\" contest on the instructables website. If you like the design, please vote for my design. http://www.instructables.com/id/Soldering-Assistant/"
