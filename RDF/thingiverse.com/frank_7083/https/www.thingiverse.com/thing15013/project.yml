function: "Design and Print 3D Parts with Open Source tools\r\n\r\nThe plastic face is designed in ooml, it's structure is composed of a base and a system of movements\r\n\r\nThe base contains 4 DC motors to 5V, two motors in vertically possition these make top and down movements of the face and the other two horizontals engines at the base makes \xE2\u20AC\u2039\xE2\u20AC\u2039the moves from right to left and vice versa\r\n\r\n\"Plastic face\" don't have all the structure in plastic, because the screws and nuts are the  needs to be accurate to better displacement in the motion system. But we've made couplings to mount metal screws and nuts.\r\n\r\nsee it working here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-yA5ByS_lE&context=C38c6023ADOEgsToPDskKCo7rwgXKiirQxYNqug0d0"
