The phone is hold more firmly in this dock.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe phone fits only without case.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe cable fits very snug!\r\nIf you use some other cable, you should increse the width of the cable-guide-gutter.\r\nThat is the 'w'-variable in the scad-file, it can be found under the comment '//USB'.\r\n(look at the cable on the photo, that's not the cable that comes with the phone)\r\n\r\n(Samsung Copyright and stuff)"
