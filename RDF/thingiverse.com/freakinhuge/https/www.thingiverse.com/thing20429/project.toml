function = "Have you ever misplaced your Gatorade Cap? Well fear not! Now you can print out a new one and keep those liquids in the bottle where they belong!  \n\nYou could also use this in a model if you wanted to mount something to the bottle..  \n\nThis was designed in Inventor 2011 mainly to keep me fresh with it and to see if it could be done!  \n\nOh and just as a word of caution. Due to the fact that I can not print rubber \"yet\" this cap doesn't have the rubber coating on the inside that actually seals the bottle. But it will do.  \n\nPrinted in Black ABS on my Prusa Mendel with a heated bed.  \n\nUpdate: Added a step file as well as parasolid files."
