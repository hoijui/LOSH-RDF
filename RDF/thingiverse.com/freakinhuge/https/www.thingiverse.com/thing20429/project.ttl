You could also use this in a model if you wanted to mount something to the bottle..  

This was designed in Inventor 2011 mainly to keep me fresh with it and to see if it could be done!  

Oh and just as a word of caution. Due to the fact that I can not print rubber "yet" this cap doesn't have the rubber coating on the inside that actually seals the bottle. But it will do.  

Printed in Black ABS on my Prusa Mendel with a heated bed.  

Update: Added a step file as well as parasolid files.""" ;
