function: "I wanted to mount my Arduino to the Spherebot without using zip ties. So here are some mounts to do just that. They use M3x10 bolts and I put a washer inbetween the nut and the mount. There are only 3 mounts because I originally designed this for a Duemilanove and it only has three holes.\r\n\r\nPrinted in Black ABS on my Prusa Mendel with Heated Bed.\r\n\r\nAlso included is the DWG I designed them in."
