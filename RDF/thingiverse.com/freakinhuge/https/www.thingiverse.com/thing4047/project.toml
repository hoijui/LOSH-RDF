Like before, you will need to modify your weird dino or something if you want to use this with a stepper motor. So with that being said, this is experimental, but in theory it should work.\r\n\r\nI have also included the Sketchup file.\r\n\r\nThanks goes to dsralph for the idea to print this.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Updated STL files. Due to stupid STL export from Sketchup, the others were not goodly... This are much happier! :D"
