function: "This is what I pictured in my head as soon as I saw the above thing.\r\n\r\nI made the box a tube and added some threads to the top and bottom. I also included a top cap and bottom cap. But what makes this AWESOME is the inner section of the threaded tube that will allow you to make this carrier of sorts as long as you want!\r\n\r\nPrint some http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1272 to add a male buckle for this\r\n\r\nHave fun and try coming up with different modules to add for a truly modular thing!\r\n\r\nNOTE: This has been printed by Thaed and it seems to fit perfectly together! So it should be good to go!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATES\r\n\r\nFiles have been updated to ones generated in Inventor. They are much cleaner now and look purddy... :-D I have also included the Inventor files.\r\n\r\nThanks goes to ub3rgeek for his bolt thing he made in Inventor. It got the gears rolling for my pea-brain to figure out how to make threads... http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4880\r\n\r\nAdded BuckleTube_Female2Buckle.stl to include a version with two buckles.\r\n\r\nAdded BuckleTube_GenderChanger,stl so you can flip orientations of modules.\r\n\r\nCheck out Thaed's print! http://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:11434"
