function = "I finally was able to get around to remaking this ribbon in Inventor. It now looks much more real and it's super awesome! I have also included the Inventor file so people that have access to Inventor can use that.. The stl is medium resolution. I can upload a higher resolution if someone wants it, but I figured our 3D printers would not like that too much...\r\n\r\nThis should be printable. I would suggest turning on supports if it doesn't come out. Sorry that I can't print one right now. My MakerBot is giving me troubles again...\r\n\r\nAdded a \"bent\" version to exaggerate the ribbon dynamics. This one will need some support material I think. ;)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I got a print back from Ponoko since my MakerBot is down. Check out the pics.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I dyed the model pink. Looks pretty good. It is more pale than the picture implies.. ;)"
