function = "So what do you get when you combined a Spoon, a Fork and a Knife? You get a Sporknife! This is your one stop utensil for taking down anything the fridge can throw at you...\r\n\r\nI modeled this off of a cheap sporknife thing I found at a dollar store.. The model itself is pretty complex, I would say... Multiple planes with bends in one plane, two different ways, etc..\r\n\r\nIt was fun to recreate though! :D\r\n\r\nThere are two STLs for printing: High Res and Low Res. Pretty self explanatory. Once again, the Inventor file is kind of messy.. I really need to start cleaning those up after I'm done..\r\n\r\nThis was printed at Ponoko.com"
