\r
I modeled this off of a cheap sporknife thing I found at a dollar store.. The model itself is pretty complex, I would say... Multiple planes with bends in one plane, two different ways, etc..\r
\r
It was fun to recreate though! :D\r
\r
There are two STLs for printing: High Res and Low Res. Pretty self explanatory. Once again, the Inventor file is kind of messy.. I really need to start cleaning those up after I'm done..\r
