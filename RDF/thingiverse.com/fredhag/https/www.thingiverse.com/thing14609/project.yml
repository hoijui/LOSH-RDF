function: "I love all of the cube farm pieces.  As I was handing out a few cube farms to people, they suggested I make a simple box for them so the smaller things wouldn't get lost.  Here is a simple 70mmx70mmx50mm box with a 1mm thickness for storing the pieces.  I am sure there are much more elaborate things available with covers, etc., , but this works for me.\r\n\r\nI'm a n00b so I simply made this in Sketchup, converted to stl with a plugin, and printed it - so no special instructions."
