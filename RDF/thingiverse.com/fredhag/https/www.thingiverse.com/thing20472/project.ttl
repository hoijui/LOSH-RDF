    okh:function "I guess this will either whet the appetite or turn people away because I cannot share the molecular structure for the ion channel that is used in conjunction with this holder until the research has been published.  Nonetheless, this cup is meant to help someone assemble the four small proteins that combine to form a molecular ion channel as found in living organism's cells.  The cup is designed to make it easier to see how the pieces fit together but also give a good view of the channel itself, from above and from below the cup (the channel is orthogonal to opening in the cup, right down the center)." ;
