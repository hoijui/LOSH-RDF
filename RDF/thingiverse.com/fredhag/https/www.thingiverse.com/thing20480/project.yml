function: I made a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9459 in order to fit my iPad in its very thick case (with the case folded backward to fit into the slot and use as a digital photo album when docked and also added an insert to use when docking an iPhone or iPod to support it in that deep slot.  In general, this design is for someone that has an iPad that will fit a slot that is approximately 5mm in front of the midline of the 30-pin connector and 15mm behind it.  I added a semicircular slot to allow one to use the Home Button when a device is docked.  Lastly, the hexagonal holes out the front of the dock are meant to allow redirection of the sound from an iPhone speaker and to an iPhone mic (it works pretty well).
