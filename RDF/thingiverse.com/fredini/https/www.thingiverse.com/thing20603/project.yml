function: "A self portrait by the Great Fredini.\r\n\r\nI had to post this, as it was a major accomplishment for me to get ReconstructMe running on My MacBook Pro. Whew! I haven't jumped so many hoops since I stitched QTVR panoramas from the command line back in 1995. So satisfying to finally get this working!!!\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to playing with ReconstructMe more and trying some full body scans of the cavalcade of Coney Island characters... Stay tuned!"
