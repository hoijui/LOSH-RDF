function = "##This thing is now deprecated and replaced with my 2.0 version *\"Scan-O-Tron Turntable v.2.0 for Full Body 3D Scanning\"* http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:729923 which uses a chain drive and wormgear motor to lock the turntable as the subject mounts and dismounts.   \n\nA 3D scanning turntable capable of supporting the weight of a human being.  Since discovering ReconstructMe, I've been looking for a suitable turntable setup for creating full body scans of people. Most of the plans out there are for tabletop photo or scanning setups that won't handle a lot of weight.   \n\nLo and behold, I found these plans http://cheesycam.com/motorized-lazy-susan-heavy-duty/, for using the  \nfront wheel hub assembly from a car as the rotation bearing and an electric drill to power turning it. My implementation can be built for around $100.  \n\nThis device is the centerpiece of my Coney Island Scan-A-Rama Project- a next generation photo booth in which subjects are scanned and printed.   \n\nUpdate 10/16/2012  \n------------------------  \nI have added a 12volt 4RPM high torque rotisserie motor with a 3D printed pulley driving a bicycle inner tube belt drive. I just uploaded images of the motor (got it on ebay), the updated assembly, as well as source files for my pulley print, with slots for a set screw and nut.   \n\nUpdate 7/21/2013  \n-----------------------    \nAdded a new pulley in two parts that can be printed on a Replicator build platform, then glued afterwards. Drill afterwards to use a setscrew through a bolt in the slot against the flattened part of the motor shaft.   \n\nUpdate 8/3/2013  \n-----------------------    \nI have also added a foot pedal to apply power to the turntable motor. However, I am seeking advice for a braking mechanism for the wheel when power is not applied. I was thinking a solenoid or something that could retract as power is on. I have safety concerns for the wheel spinning as people climb on or off the wheel. Any thoughts on this are appreciated.   \n\nUpdate 2/6/2015  \n----------------------------  \nI added some images of the brake assembly. This will be the last update to this thing as this design is deprecated. I hope to post the designs for my 2.0 turntable design soon. The new design uses a worm gear motor and chain driving a sprocket to rotate the wheel, making for easier mounting and dismounting of the scanning subject."
