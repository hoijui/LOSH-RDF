function: These guitar picks are an easy to make they are sturdy as well, so they are good as picks.  They are small so you need to keep an eye on them, but they are good picks.  They are 3 mm thick florescent blue acrylic and they are very sturdy, but like all guitar picks they grind away eventually, but not as fast as the standard guitar pick.
