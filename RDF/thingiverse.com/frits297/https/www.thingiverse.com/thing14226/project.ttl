This project originated from the urge to create tools that help designers create professional results in times of budget cuts. With â€˜Tools for Designâ€™ we aim to create a community that helps in the development of instruments used in the design process. The Stead-I-Cam is an example of one of these tools. It supports smooth and professional moving video footage. It is created from a single sheet of laser-cut material, making it easy for any student to create and assemble. This open-source project cuts costs for such a professional tool and makes it accessible for every student / diy'er.\r

We love to see your own Stead i Cam so upload a picture of it!""" ;
