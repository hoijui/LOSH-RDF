function = "Hello!\r\n\r\nThis is the update design of the Stead i Cam. We've fixed a few issues, here is a list with all the improvements:\r\n\r\n- smaller laser foot print (600mm x 300mm)\r\n- updated camera-plate (even if your glue breaks, your camera will still stay on the frame\r\n- we've converted everything to M4\r\n- completely new bearing holder, requires almost no glue, the bearing sits inside a cage, doesn't slip through the handle like some previous versions, sits on top of the handle\r\n- the axle goes all the way through the handle for increased robustness\r\n- the train (the thing inside the frame that moves forward/backwards) is updated, too many improvements to mention\r\n- added a bill of materials!\r\n\r\nThe original design can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14226\r\n\r\nThe Stead i Cam is designed by Frits Stam en Koen de Greef.\r\n\r\nThis project originated from the urge to create tools that help designers create professional results in times of budget cuts. With â€˜Tools for Designâ€™ we aim to create a community that helps in the development of instruments used in the design process. The Stead-I-Cam is an example of one of these tools. It supports smooth and professional moving video footage. It is created from a single sheet of laser-cut material, making it easy for any student to create and assemble. This open-source project cuts costs for such a professional tool and makes it accessible for every student / diy'er.\r\n\r\nWe love to see your own Stead i Cam so upload a picture of it!"
