function: "Hello!\r\n\r\nThis is the update design of the Stead i Cam. We've fixed a few issues, here is a list with all the improvements:\r\n\r\n- smaller laser foot print (600mm x 300mm)\r\n- updated camera-plate (even if your glue breaks, your camera will still stay on the frame\r\n- we've converted everything to M4\r\n- completely new bearing holder, requires almost no glue, the bearing sits inside a cage, doesn't slip through the handle like some previous versions, sits on top of the handle\r\n- the axle goes all the way through the handle for increased robustness\r\n- the train (the thing inside the frame that moves forward/backwards) is updated, too many improvements to mention\r\n- added a bill of materials!\r\n\r\nThe original design can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14226\r\n\r\nThe Stead i Cam is designed by Frits Stam en Koen de Greef.\r\n\r\nThis project originated from the urge to create tools that help designers create professional results in times of budget cuts. With \xE2\u20AC\u02DCTools for Design\xE2\u20AC\u2122 we aim to create a community that helps in the development of instruments used in the design process. The Stead-I-Cam is an example of one of these tools. It supports smooth and professional moving video footage. It is created from a single sheet of laser-cut material, making it easy for any student to create and assemble. This open-source project cuts costs for such a professional tool and makes it accessible for every student / diy'er.\r\n\r\nWe love to see your own Stead i Cam so upload a picture of it!"
