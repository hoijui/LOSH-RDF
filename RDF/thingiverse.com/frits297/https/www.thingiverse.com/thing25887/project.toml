function = "Hi there!\r\n\r\nThis is a laser cut piece inspired by the work of M.C. Escher. The work is inspired by mathematical patterns and the autumn season in which I designed this piece.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that one shape (in this case a leaf) is repeated throughout the work using translations and rotations. The shape is specific and are often referred to their 'grundtype' (see illustration). The grundtype used in this work is C3C3C3C3. \r\n\r\nI love seeing my work somewhere else, if you do decide to use my design, please be so kind to mention me as the original designer, thank you."
