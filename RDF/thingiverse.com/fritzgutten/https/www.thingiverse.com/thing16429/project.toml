function = "this is a proof of concept in the use of driving more than 2 filaments (3 here) using 2 motors. one motor drives the filament while the other drives a cam that pushes the filament into the drive shaft. \r\ni am currently preparing to test this, but wanted to get it out there. current issues are that is does not have good access to the drive mechanism for cleaning or feeding filament and that much of it was designed to be machined instead of printed. the side plates are to big for a cupcake, but i ws able to print a few of the pieces on one. it may also not be compatible with other motors until there is a redesign, as the motors are integral to its strength.\r\nif anyone has improvements, let me know.\r\nEDIT: added an IGES assembly file(let me know when you find its broken, and how to fix it) and SW2005 part and assembly files. also added an exploded image\r\nEDIT: lookes like this has been worked on a bit already by wildseyed http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10783 . not sure if i should list it as derivative.\r\nFinally got more than 1 hot end functional at a time, so to check out the filament drive in action see http://youtu.be/CVaYHlLkvWM\r\nand http://youtu.be/yqAGEqaoPg4\r\n\r\n\r\nit works! all 3 filaments running:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/po8KyagUsY4  \r\nhttp://youtu.be/-X-azhcsqdM"
