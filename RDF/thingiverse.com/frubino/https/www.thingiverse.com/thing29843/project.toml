function = "This print is an adapter for a Bosch hand drill to an old Black & Decker drill stand picked up a at flea market.\r\n\r\nThe drill model is GSB 10 RE and has a 43mm diameter handle collet.\r\n\r\nThe drill stand is B&D model 78-936 Type 1\r\n\r\nAs this is a variable speed drill, I added a trigger adjustment screw to dial in the speed.  The Knob component is pressed and super glued to a M6 x 35 Hex Head screw and the nut is retained in the Yoke with a spot of superglue."
