function = "A general purpose 2\" c-clamp utilizing a M8x50mm bolt.\r\n\r\nThe frame of the clamp was downloaded from a public CAD library and modified to house the matching M8 nut to accompany the bolt.\r\n\r\nThere is a swivel pad threaded to the end of the bolt which required support material for my built.  Once the support was disolved, the two halves of the swivel were gently seperated with a pair of pliers."
