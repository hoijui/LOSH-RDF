    okh:function """The Cam-Locks on the Manfrotto tripod model 728B are prone to cracking due to a thin wall thickness.  The body of the cam-lock sees a tremendous amount of stress which over time leads to a catastrophic failure (hopefully not when you have a $2000 DSLR mounted on it).  In my opinion, a high-end tripod shouldn't have a $0.25 molded part that is prone to cracking and costs $15ea to replace.\r
\r
The model I generated has a wall thickness of almost 4mm at its thinnest compared to the factory's 2mm.  I haven't put it through temperature cycling and aging, but I am confident it will hold up better than the original.""" ;
