function = "I recently posted an Instructable titled \"Cordless Power Tool Conversion 18VDC to 120/240VAC\".  In the tutorial I go thru step-by-step instructions to modify a dead 18V Ryobi battery into an adapter to be used with an AC/DC power supply.  \r\n\r\nIn the adapter, I installed this swivel cable lock to allow the cable entering the battery case to be positioned either facing foward or rearward, depending on the tool being used."
