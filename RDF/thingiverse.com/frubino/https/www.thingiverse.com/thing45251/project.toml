function = "One of my detail sanders landing in a bad way from a fall onto a concrete floor.  Rather than trying to source out a replacement head I just printed one out in 3 hours.   Gotta love having a personal factory at your fingertips.\r\n\r\nThe original part was superglued back together to get some decent dimensions for reverse engineering.  \r\n\r\nTo strengthen the stem I made a cavity for a standard M8x30 socket head bolt to be epoxied in for a little added rigidity."
