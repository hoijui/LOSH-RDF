function = "There are times I want to mount my phone to a variety of surfaces, ie windshield, desk stand, tripod, etc.  I found a cheap alternative to those fancy clamps is to just use self adhesive hook & loop strips on the back of my polymer phone protector. \r\n\r\nFor my tripod mount, I printed this simple bracket to affix the hook strip.  The dovetail mount is designed for a Manfrotto tripod, but I think it might work for a variety of manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe bracket is tall enough to accomodate the phone in both the vertical and horizontal positions."
