function: "This is a support for the Elektor Flashboard microcontroller system (http://www.elektor.com/products/kits-modules/kits/070125-71-usb-flash-board.271292.lynkx). The holes in the support correspond to the holes of a BoeBot chassis, which is slightly less wide than the controllerboard. The controllerboard can be mounted on the support with 4 small M3 bolts. For attaching it to the BoeBot chassis you'll need an extra 3 M3 bolts and nuts.\r\nThe Sketchup file is included, so the support can be adapted to other microcontroller systems."
