function = "I was inspired by a piece of armor in the video game Halo Reach to attach a GPS module to my arm.  The only GPS I have is on my Droid X2.\r\nIt's practical for texting, GPS navigation, and talking with speaker phone.\r\nI timed it: it takes about 1 minute for your arm to get tired when holding it in front of you."
