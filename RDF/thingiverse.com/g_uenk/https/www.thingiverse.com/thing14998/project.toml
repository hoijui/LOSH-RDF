function = "This mount was designed to be able to slide a HTC Desire cell phone in a holder and gets powered. \r\nI also wanted the holder to be removable from the dashboard mount due to a ball-joint so it would also enables rotation of the holder. \r\nThe holder can be clicked on and off from the mount.\r\n\r\nThe dashboard mount does not require drilling or glue to prevent damage.\r\nIt mounts by pushing two flat pieces between the soft parts above the radio."
