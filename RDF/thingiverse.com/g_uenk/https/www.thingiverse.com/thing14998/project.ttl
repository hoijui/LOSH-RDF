I also wanted the holder to be removable from the dashboard mount due to a ball-joint so it would also enables rotation of the holder. \r
The holder can be clicked on and off from the mount.\r
\r
The dashboard mount does not require drilling or glue to prevent damage.\r
It mounts by pushing two flat pieces between the soft parts above the radio.""" ;
