function = "My girlfriend hates exposed blades, and I really hate reaching into my kitchen drawer, where knives are tumbled every which way waiting to shred my hand looking for a spatula. So, I made this to solve the problem (Love you, baby!).\r\n\r\nThis knife rack holds 2 large knives (Chef's) and 2 small knives (Paring, utility, etc) It has high walls and handle support to ensure that the knives stay in and blades stay enclosed.\r\n\r\nLooking back, it probably would have been more efficient to CAD a universal knife sheath."
