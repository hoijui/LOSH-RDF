function = "A modification of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19590 with a wider opening for my budaschnozzle. The problem wasn't the hotend itself but the mount that bolts onto the extruder. Another fix would be to make the mount itself the quick change plate.\r\n\r\nNote: I haven't printed this myself, by the time I noticed the budaschnozzle wouldn't fit I had printed the original part. My changes were put in with a dremel :P Should work well though."
