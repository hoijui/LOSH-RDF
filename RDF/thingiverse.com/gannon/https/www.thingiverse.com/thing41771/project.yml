function: "After looking at thing:41744 I thought it would be great for my TK-0 ( thing:31412 ) whenever I get around to finishing the openscad files for it. But of course, there were some changes that came to mind! I would like to use extra 8mm threaded rod and 608 bearings for this. Also, I wanted to try a slide in connection to cut down on vitamins!\r\nJust a note, although this should work, it is unprinted and untested!"
