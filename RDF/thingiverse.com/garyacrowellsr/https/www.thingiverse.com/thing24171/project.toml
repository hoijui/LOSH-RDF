function = "This is very similar to its ancestor except for a few subtle changes.  I was a bit disappointed in the original in that the spool base and wall changed with the spool diameter. This required a different wall piece for every spool size.  I've altered the code so that the wall piece and spool base are always a fixed size, so that any size spool part can fit on a single wall mounting. (Any size spool smaller than an MBI, that is.  If there are larger spool hub sizes, a larger base would be required.) I've also beveled a few corners to make insertions easier."
