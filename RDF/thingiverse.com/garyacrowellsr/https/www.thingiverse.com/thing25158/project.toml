function = "Carcassone is a tile-laying game.  The 'game board' grows as the tiles are laid, in whatever direction the tiles fit.  In our games there has been a continuing problem in keeping the tiles straight, and it can become a major operation if the 'board' has to be shifted if it nears a table edge.  The Tile Grids each hold nine tiles in perfect alignment, and the grids snap together with small dovetail joints to grow the board in any direction as necessary.  There are small raised ridges between each tile, but this doesn't detract from the game.  A small game can be held by about ten grids, but a large one with many expansions could take 20 or more grids.  The photos show a game as it expands over time."
