function = "These small clips mount on the diagonal front piece of the Replicator Hood by Dave Randolf: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23386\r\n\r\nI love this hood, but one of the minor annoying things was that the sloped piece on the front sagged a little bit, since it was unsupported except at the edges.  These clips join the sloped piece to the top and front at a couple of points, fixing the sag and any vibration of that piece.  In addition, the lower clips have an extra slot, that can be used to hold the front cover out of the way when it is removed.\r\n\r\nI was really surprised that this improves the rigidity of the hood dramatically.  It's a must-do if you have one of Dave's hoods."
