I can't decide which one I like better, the radial, or the honeycomb pattern; so I uploaded both.  To tell the truth, I'm not exactly thrilled with either, and I'm expecting someone to come up with a snazzier pattern.\r
\r
The honeycomb pattern is probably more airflow restrictive, and it might benefit from a larger honeycomb pattern.""" ;
