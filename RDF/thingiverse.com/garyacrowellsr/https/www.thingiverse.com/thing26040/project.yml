function: "A couple of people on the forum have mentioned that they've broken blades on their Replicator extruder fans.  Well, that sounds like a need for a fan guard.\r\n\r\nI can't decide which one I like better, the radial, or the honeycomb pattern; so I uploaded both.  To tell the truth, I'm not exactly thrilled with either, and I'm expecting someone to come up with a snazzier pattern.\r\n\r\nThe honeycomb pattern is probably more airflow restrictive, and it might benefit from a larger honeycomb pattern."
