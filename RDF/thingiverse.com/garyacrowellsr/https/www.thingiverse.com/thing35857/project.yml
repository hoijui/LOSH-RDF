function: "The attached .pdf file is simply a list of links to upgrades of the MakerBot Replicator that are (mostly) found on Thingiverse.\r\n\r\nWhile I love Thingiverse, it is sometimes impossible to find something you've seen before, regardless of search options.  This list just puts all of the Replicator upgrades in one place."
