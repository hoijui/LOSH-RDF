function: "My fat fingers and a small allen wrenches don't work well together.  I've never come across a nice small T-handle set that isn't too big/long to get into the Replicator spaces.  This Thing gives small allen wrenches a bit of a handle to make them easier to ... handle.\r\n\r\nThere is also an alternate screwdriver-like round handle.  \r\n\r\nIncluded are .stl files for five small wrench sizes, and it shouldn't be difficult to change the .scad files for any size you want."
