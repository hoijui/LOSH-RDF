function: thecharacterg did a great rework of my Replicator foot, and I've only changed his work slightly here.  I mainly published this to point out the use of the Sorbothane Isolators.  I'll be the first to tell you that they are absurdly expensive for just a foot bumper.  But the pads I used originally were highly compressed under the Replicator weight, and it actually looks like they are compressing more with age.  Plus, the weight of my Replicator is increasing, with the XL mod, and new aluminum platform arms.  The Sorbothane bumpers are perfectly sized for the weight of the Replicator+.  When you get one of these in your hand, you'll see how different they are from a common foam pad or rubber bumper.
