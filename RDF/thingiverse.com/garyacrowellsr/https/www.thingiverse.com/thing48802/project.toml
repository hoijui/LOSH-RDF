function = "This is not a thing you're likely to specifically need.  This is here just to spark some ideas.  My wife bought an acrylic lion figure at a flea market, and it came with a pretty ugly lighted wooden base.  When the light burned out and I went to get a replacement, I found these nice blue LED candelabra base, night-lite type bulbs.  They were much too cool for the old base, so I printed this base.  It's not perfect, but it made the wife happy, and scored a few points."
