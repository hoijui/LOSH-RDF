function: "A small foot that can clip onto the 6mm bars of a Mini-Mendel/Huxley RepRap printer.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 5.6.11: I should warn that I created these feet before constructing the Z axis, and it may be the case that these feet are too short with all the gears and mechanisms under the Z rods.  At the moment there are a few millimeters clearance, but I have not yet installed the motors or Z rods completely.  I will update this description once I complete the build.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 11.6.11: If the feet are placed on the lowermost bar (front and back) then there is plenty of room for the Z axis.  I've attached some photos showing this.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc097b350c8941b"
