Again, this was my situation and by random I found the RepRap Tweezer Holder by swighton http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6996. After printing I realized that it is made for a completely different machines than my Prusa Mendel. The diameter of the rod clamp was to big. Maybe the original Mendel uses bigger threaded rods or it is made for imperial measurement.\r

Unluckily there hasn't been an .scad file. So I continued my experiences with OpenSCAD and designed my second piece :D.""" ;
