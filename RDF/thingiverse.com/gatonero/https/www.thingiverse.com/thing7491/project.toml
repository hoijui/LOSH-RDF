function = "The very first idea what to print when I will have a working 3D-Printer was, to substitute my chunky car mount for my Galaxy S GTI9000 Android phone.\r\n\r\nWhat I have is a car mount from Gomadic. I like the mechanism to clip it to the air vent and to turn around my phone, but the bracket is quite horrible beside I can only see half the screen of my phone while driving.\r\n\r\nSo I discovered mojomoneys Halo Themed Case For Samsung Captivate http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3828. My idea was to attach a slot to the backside to connect the bracket and the case.\r\n\r\nUnluckily I realized that the dimensions for switches, microphone and camera on a Captivate are different from a Galaxy.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to adjust it and asked mojomoney for the source files. He posted some SolidWorks files (Thank you!), which I couldn't use because I don't I have this software. So I worked with the .stl file and OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nFirst of all OpenSCAD told me, that this .stl isn't a manifold object. So I started to get it manifold. For that I have had to remove all the nice Halo carvings, which mojomoney made :( (Excuse me for that!). But in the very end I got a manifolded object. It doesn't look as nice as mojomoneys, the holes are all squared and not rounded, but I don't want to carry it around just put it into my car.\r\n\r\nAlso I designed a small slot mechanism which I glued to the backside. I did it that somebody can use the case for other designs. \r\n\r\nThanks again mojomoney for your perfect design! I couldn't have done this by my own, I've just two weeks experiences with CAD software (OpenSCAD)."
