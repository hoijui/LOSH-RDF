I then decided to build a robot to actually do the reading and the moving...\r
\r
My first prototype was built in plywood, but then I decided I wanted to build something that was less prone to defects , so I got my first Makerbot, redesigned most of the components, and started printing!\r
\r
This is  an ongoing project, and I still have my plywood components working, waiting to be replaced by their ABS counterparts.\r
\r
The electronics is based on an Arduino that reads the input from an external PC where the Solver software runs; it then drives the 12 servos that manipulate the Cube.""" ;
