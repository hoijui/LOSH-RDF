function: "A while ago I wrote a program to read and solve the Professor version (5x5x5) of the Rubik's cube.\r\nI then decided to build a robot to actually do the reading and the moving...\r\n\r\nMy first prototype was built in plywood, but then I decided I wanted to build something that was less prone to defects , so I got my first Makerbot, redesigned most of the components, and started printing!\r\n\r\nThis is  an ongoing project, and I still have my plywood components working, waiting to be replaced by their ABS counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe electronics is based on an Arduino that reads the input from an external PC where the Solver software runs; it then drives the 12 servos that manipulate the Cube."
