It calculates various print details like  \n-print time  \n-used filament  \n-yx move distance  \n-print object dimension  \n-average print speeds  \n-number of layers   \n-layer details  \n-speed distribution   \n-weight and price of the printed object  \n...  \n**** UPDATE 0.98  Now with edit mode (experimental) ******  \nChange the print speed by percent  \nChange the extrusion rate by percent  \nChange the Layerheight by percent (+increase extrusion)  \nModify extruder temperatur (only update existing gcodes)  \nModify bed temperatur  (only update existing gcodes)  \nAdd Offset to Z position (requires layer option 'all'  \nAdd Offset to X position (requires layer option 'all'  \nAdd Offset to Y position (requires layer option 'all'  \nModify Fan options 0=off, 255=full (only update existing gcodes)  \nDelete the specified layers  \n\n\n\nI used it to optimize my slicer settings and print times for my reprap printer.  \nTested mostly with slic3r generated gcodes."
