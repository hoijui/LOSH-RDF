There are already some beam things available, but all are printed vertically which limits the beam length to 100mm on my reprap. Just printing the other models horizontally does not work well, because support material is needed which is very hard to remove. \r
This model allos you to print a beam horizontal, this means a max beam length of ~220mm (diagonal) on my reprap. \r
To archive  "printing without support" , I had to split the beam in the middle and add an easy slide mecanism to connect both. \r
\r
Maybe the beams are good enough to build a MendelMax with PLA/ABS beams instead of aluminium beams. Any thoughts ?\r
\r
The scad file also contains a beam connector, to connect multiple beams. \r
This allows you to extend the beam length (unlimited)""" ;
