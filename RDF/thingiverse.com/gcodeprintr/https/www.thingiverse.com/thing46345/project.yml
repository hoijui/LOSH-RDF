function: "This is a 20mm beam for various use cases. \r\nThere are already some beam things available, but all are printed vertically which limits the beam length to 100mm on my reprap. Just printing the other models horizontally does not work well, because support material is needed which is very hard to remove. \r\nThis model allos you to print a beam horizontal, this means a max beam length of ~220mm (diagonal) on my reprap. \r\nTo archive  \"printing without support\" , I had to split the beam in the middle and add an easy slide mecanism to connect both. \r\n\r\nMaybe the beams are good enough to build a MendelMax with PLA/ABS beams instead of aluminium beams. Any thoughts ?\r\n\r\nThe scad file also contains a beam connector, to connect multiple beams. \r\nThis allows you to extend the beam length (unlimited)"
