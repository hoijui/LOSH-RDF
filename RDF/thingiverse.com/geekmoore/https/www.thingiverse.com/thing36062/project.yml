function: "This is a simple robot design that has been developed to work with and the Shrimp (http://shrimping.it) Arduino and Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to create a cheap robot that can be built in schools and can easily be customised by students. For this reason we have tried to design a simple chassis that can be build entirely from a single piece of wood/perspex.\r\n\r\nFollow the development of the ShrimpBot at http://geekmoore.wordpress.com/ & http://www.youtube.com/geekmoore226"
