function = "Do you ride clipless pedals but don't like wearing your cleats after a short ride to the store or standing around at a party? Print out some clipless pedal pedals and enjoy a comfortable ride to your next event.\r\n\r\nThese are designed for 2 hole (SPD style) cleats, but could easily be modified for 3 hole. I ride Crank Brothers and it is quite easy to clip these in and out.\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad. (https://tinkercad.com/p/acc02218f590e88b/178)"
