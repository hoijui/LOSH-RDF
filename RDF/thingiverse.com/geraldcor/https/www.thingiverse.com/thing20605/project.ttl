The beauty of this set is that it has self contained storage and you can even save your game! Each board piece has a little hole in the middle, as do the chess pieces themselves. If you have to pack up your game before you are done playing, you can just start stacking the board pieces with the chess piece still inside and then use a string or similar to link all of the pieces together. Then, when you have made it to camp, or landed, just un-string all of the pieces in the reverse order and put your board back together.\r
\r
This set is strictly a utilitarian chess set so fanciness was kept to a minimum for quick and simple printing. You will notice there are a bunch of different files for the different side and corner pieces. Make sure you count properly when printing - or print some extras incase you lose some (the beauty of making your own pieces)""" ;
