function = "This is a filament holder. I designed it to have the least amount of parts. The printed parts are printed on a Felix 1.0 3d printer from www.felixprinters.com \r\n\r\nThe goal was to mount it vertically on the aluminum frame of the printer, but the filament was intertwined so when rolling of it got stuck. For these kind of filament rolls, it is good to put it on a flat surface (floor, table). \r\n\r\nIt is reliable and hasn't failed me yet after printing for lots of hours.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n2 bearings (inner diameter: 8mm outer diameter: 22mm)\r\n3x 250 mm M8 rods\r\n1x 50 mm M8 rod or bolt\r\n14x m8 bolts\r\n3x printed parts"
