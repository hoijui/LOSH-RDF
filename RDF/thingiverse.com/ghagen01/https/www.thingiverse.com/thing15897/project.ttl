    okh:function """I finally made a re-design of the extruder assembly of a Beta \r
Ultimaker. \r
The design was on my mind for a long time. \r
The advance is the bigger diameter off the "bolt" (20 mm) and a bearing as a pressure roller. \r
Also the wheel has just straight grooves so I don't have to clean it anymore. \r
Because the grooves are straight it's not grinding in the filament \r
anymore. \r
I print for many hours without cleaning. \r
My parts are looking better also because of the constant transit of\r
the filament. \r
\r
The only disadvantage is that you have to make some parts in steel. \r
