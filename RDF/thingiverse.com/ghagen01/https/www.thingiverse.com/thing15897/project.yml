function: "I finally made a re-design of the extruder assembly of a Beta \r\nUltimaker. \r\nThe design was on my mind for a long time. \r\nThe advance is the bigger diameter off the \"bolt\" (20 mm) and a bearing as a pressure roller. \r\nAlso the wheel has just straight grooves so I don't have to clean it anymore. \r\nBecause the grooves are straight it's not grinding in the filament \r\nanymore. \r\nI print for many hours without cleaning. \r\nMy parts are looking better also because of the constant transit of\r\nthe filament. \r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage is that you have to make some parts in steel. \r\n\r\nGeo Hagen\r\nhttp://www.hagentb.nl"
