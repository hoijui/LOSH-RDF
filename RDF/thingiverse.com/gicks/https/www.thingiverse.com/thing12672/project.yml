function: "This is the first attempt at making a lenshood for the canon 18-55 kitlens. It is still a work in progress, but I wanted to share the preliminary results.\r\n\r\nThe little notch on the bajonet needs to be smaller and probably placed differently.I removed them with pliers so the lenshood would fit. Also the  ultimaker printed the hood as two layers which didn't completely adhere.I guess this has to do with the settings of the ultimaker which I'm still very new to. \r\n\r\nHope to inspire some and perhaps improve on this initial desing.\r\n\r\nGicks\r\n\r\n*UPDATE*\r\nVersion 2 is up! I removed the notch on the bayonet fitting because the fitting is snug enough without it. I changed the thickness of the model from 1.2 mm to 1.0mm so that the two printed lines(inner and outer wall) are much closer together. This improved the overall stiffness of the model."
