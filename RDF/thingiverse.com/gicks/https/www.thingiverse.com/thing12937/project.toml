function = "This is a lens hood for the canon 50mm 1.8 ||. The original lens hood probably uses the thread on the lens. This lens hood is fitted to the lens using a screw on filter. Most people will have one to protect the lens. The thread of the filter fits exactly through the lens hood, when tightening the filter the lens hood is secured between the lens and the filter."
