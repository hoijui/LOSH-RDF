function = "A simple crown form, which proves quite challenging to print. There is quite a bit of bridging and overhang.\r\nBiggest problem at the moment is that PLA is smeared upwards causing the extruder head to run into the object. My first print also shows that at about 60% the positioning is affected because of it.\r\n\r\nI will be doing more tests, lowering temperature to prevent stringing and decrease speed to hopefully prevent upwards smearing.\r\n\r\nWould be very interested to see other peoples copies and of course learn from their experience."
