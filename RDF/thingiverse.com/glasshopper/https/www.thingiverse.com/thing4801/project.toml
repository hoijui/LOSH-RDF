function = "Re draw of Tinhead's Valkyrie stepper motor board (V2.7)to use surface mount parts in a single sided board to make it easy to fabricate yourself.\r\n\r\nThis uses I2C to communicate with the main board \r\n(see; http://letsmakerobots.com/node/9006)\r\n\r\nBecause it is surface mount I added an isp header to allow programing \r\nand just for fun I added a ftdi header.\r\nI also added a second I2C header to allow easy daisy chaining of stepper boards."
