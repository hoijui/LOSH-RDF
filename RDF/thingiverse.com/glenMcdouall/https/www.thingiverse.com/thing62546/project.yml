function: I had been using Pit3k's feeder end bowden clamp for a while now, but there seemed to be alot of play up and down as the filament was extruded and retracted, so i merged his model with Helmforest bowden bracket to create this, which has absolutely no movement what so ever, so hopefully some slightly more accurate retraction
