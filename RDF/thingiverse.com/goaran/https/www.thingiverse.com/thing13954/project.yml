function: "This in another reprap derivat printer. The main idea to built it was to get a printer which is fast and has lots of space to build things. The x and y axis work with an etch-a-sketch kind of mechanism with two belts. The z axis is driven by 3 thread rods. The main frame is a cube built of 20mm extruded aluminium profile. my frame is 400x400x400 but this can be scaled as you like.   \nThe extruder i designed for the printer is that one: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14311 and the electronics i use are these: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6480  \nThe pulleys were rendere with the scad script by droftarts: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16627 thanks a lot for that. Except for the frame,the rods and some standard parts, all parts are printed. (The edge-connecters could be printed too, this can be extended here)   \nUPDATE: i connected the stepper drivers and the other electronix for the axis today and did some first axis-tests. There is a video on vimeo:  \nhttps://vimeo.com/50614766 and another one where also the z-axis is moving every few seconds after a layer is finished (it is printing the squirrel thing with honeycomb infill)  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=989PFsqJshA  \nI had it running without an extruder just to test if the axis go as fast as i want them to run (which they do). For printing i think the speed will have to be reduced. Next thin will be the endstops, and finally the extruder."
