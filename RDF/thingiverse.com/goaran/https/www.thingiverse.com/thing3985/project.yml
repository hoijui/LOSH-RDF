function: this is a extruder concept i made for my reprap. i don't have one jetz just a cnc mill so i designed all parts for easy milling. maybee this is useful for someone who also wants to integrate the reprap funktion to his cnc. The termal barrier is made of a glas tube. There is a control light which indicates heating and the thyristor is glued into a screw for easy exchange. if sombody is interested in the cad-files i can upload them as well
