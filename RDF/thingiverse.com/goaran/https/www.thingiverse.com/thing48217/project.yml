function: "This thing does not make any sense. \r\nThe reason i made it is that there is some weird spam mail that advertises some information site for berry farmers which seems not to be a big target group for spam mails and a friend of mine received that mail some hundred times.. (it seems to be some joe-job to damage the reputation of the site) \r\nto annoy her further i printed a physical version of the spam.. (i hope this will not become the default spam version in the futer)"
