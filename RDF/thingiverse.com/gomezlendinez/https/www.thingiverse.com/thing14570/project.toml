function = "If you have a robot and you want a support for sensors, maybe you have to design a support for each sensor and each position. With this, you don't need. The 3 supports that I added are:\r\n\r\n   - For Infrared sensors (Rectangular with 2 holes for bolts)\r\n   - For ultrasound sensors (Circular with 2 holes for bolts)\r\n   - For LEDs (Circula, only a hole for it)\r\n\r\nTo put in your desired position, the upper part of the support have holes (you can add more o remove holes), to introduce a bolt with tip or pushpin"
