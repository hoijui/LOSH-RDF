function = "A (mostly) parametrically defined flying saucer. Hollow dome allows for including a pilot figure, eg. octopus, Colbert, etc.  \r\nUPDATE (8/1/11): Updated v3 with a hinged hatch on the top dome for even more excitement. Depending on your machine, clearances on the hinge might need to be adjusted.  \r\nUPDATE (12/16/11): Uploaded two versions of the hatch with tighter clearances, it should clip in more solidly. V4 is snugger than V3, and V5 is the snuggest, with bigger pins. I usually use a heat gun to adjust the hinge so that the hatch closes properly."
