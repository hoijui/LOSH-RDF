function: "This is the skull of a Tarbosaurus, an Asian relative of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. The scan was originally posted online by Artec, a maker of 3D scanners, on their 3D model download page, http://www.artec3d.com/gallery/3d-models/. (Some cool stuff there, by the way.)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I've done is sliced it into 4 pieces using Netfabb, to make it easier to print. The STL from Artec is super clean, so if you have better ideas for how to prep the piece for printing, download their original file and give it a try!"
