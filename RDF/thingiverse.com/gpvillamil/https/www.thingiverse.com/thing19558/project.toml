function = "This is a camera rig for use with Autodesk's 123D Catch software and service. 123D Catch lets you generate a detailed 3D model of an object from a collection of photographs.\r\n\r\nThe rig described here helps you structure the photos for best results. It lets you spin the camera around the object at a constant height and distance, while the object stays still. You can easily move the camera up and down to get top and bottom angles."
