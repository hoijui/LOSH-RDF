function = "Industrial production of two tone flying saucers was taking a while, due to the need to separately print the hull and the insert. Now, with an accelerated firmware, you can have the entire saucer ready to glue together and invade planets, in less than 4 hours.\r\n\r\nThis is the same model as the Two Tone Flying Saucer (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11996) but prepared for dualstrusion.\r\n\r\nAlso top half and bottom half are printed simultaneously (on a Replicator)"
