function: "I have a rack on my bike, and a light from Planet Bike. The mounting hardware for the light allows it to mount on the seat post, but then it will be covered by anything on the rack. It can be mounted on one of the support struts for the rack, but then it is quite low, and often gets knocked out of alignment.\r\n\r\nThe ideal place to mount is on the rack itself, which has a fitting for a mini license plate.\r\n\r\nThis object is an adapter for the bike light, that bolts onto the license plate fitting, and still has a functioning quick release for the light.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSCAD file is broken out into modules, so if you have a Planet Bike light set, you can re-use the mounting bracket and release lever and make your own custom light mountings!"
