function: "This is my Bear trap drinks coaster. Drink needs to have a bass less then 65mm so is good for beer and tea cups, for coffee mugs you may need to scale it a bit. I kept it small as I was using it as a test print (and to save plastic and save print time). \r\nI printed with a fill of 10% \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/2G04KcHB20W"
