function = "This is a spicer joint created in Solidworks for the Rostock Printer arms, but instead of printing one at a time, this file contains all 12 required pieces ganged up in one file. The benefit is that the layers have some time to cool down, which I think makes small holes print a bit cleaner. It's also nice to not have to print 12 individual joints!"
