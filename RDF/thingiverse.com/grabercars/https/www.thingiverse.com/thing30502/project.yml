function: "After not having access to any usable http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28787, and having some major problems with skin grease on the print bed, we were looking for something to clean it up. What we found ended up making prints stick so well that for large prints we sometimes had to replace the ripped-up tape. For smaller prints it works like a dream.\r\n\r\nNote: You can't upload a thing without a file, so the .stl is http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16621 by Henque19. Thanks!"
