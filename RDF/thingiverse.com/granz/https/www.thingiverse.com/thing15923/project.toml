function = "This is an idler pulley for using Synchromesh Cable from SDP/SI ( https://sdp-si.com/eStore/PartDetail.asp?Opener=Group&PartID=84751&GroupID=768 ) in place of belts for linear motion on RepRap style printers.  You can see a video of my Prusa printing with these cables here:\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/0GMzYMI6rf8\r\n\r\nUsing this cable and non-printed pulleys gives zero backlash for me and is a nice upgrade from T5 or XL belts.  It's also fairly cheap and very lightweight."
