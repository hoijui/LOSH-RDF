function = "So, it turns out that cordless drill motors make excellent motors to drive larger robots around.  The planetary gearbox gives lots of torque.  These are mounts for the motor used in the Harbor Freight cordless drill Item #68239.  These are often on sale for $15.99.  These run great on a 12V battery, like the one you might put in your next robot."
