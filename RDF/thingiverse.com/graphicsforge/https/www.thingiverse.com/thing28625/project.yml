function: "Gustav, however, had already fired.  The driver shuddered and collapsed.  The car leaped against the perpendicular cliff, fell back and overturned, wheels uppermost.  Its engine was still running and the wheels turned absurdly in the air; but suddenly with a frightful explosion it burst into flames.\r\n\"A Ford,\" said Gustav.  \"We must get down and clear the road.\"\r\n\r\n  -Hesse, \"Der Steppenwolf\""
