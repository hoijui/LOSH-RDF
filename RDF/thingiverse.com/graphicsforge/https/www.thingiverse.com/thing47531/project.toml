function = "Blender output module for OpenSCAD  \n\nTrying to make something for Customizer, but need a better way of controlling the geometry you're customizing?  Ever peek the source for an OpenSCAD and see giant strings of values?  \nThis is the module for Blender that outputs meshes in OpenSCAD compatible format.  \n\nio_mesh_openscad is https://github.com/graphicsforge/io_mesh_openscad  \nOpenSCAD is http://www.openscad.org/  \n------  \nVersion 0.3  \n - curves now export as polygons instead of polyhedron!  Great for openscad as it's optimized for 2D  \n - clothbot fixed my fumble of merging the multimatrix function in   \n   \nVersion 0.2  \nDue entirely to clothbot and atartanian being awesome, we present the next version of io_mesh_openscad  \nYou can now:  \n - \"use \" in other openscad files in a meaningful way  \n - add shapekeys to an object in blender, and export it into a Customizerâ„¢ script  \n - export more geometries and still have actually-workingâ„¢ openscad code!!"
