function = "I wanted to transform used soda bottles into Moineau Pumps.... unfortunately, I couldn't quite pull it off so am shelving it for now until I can come up with a better solution.  \n\nBasically, the pump does not move enough volume upwards to outweigh the rate that water can seep through gaps between rotor and stator.  \n\nApplications of both silicone and plasti-dipÂ® were attempted to increase the seal between rotor and stator, but both were stripped away in a relatively small number of rotations."
