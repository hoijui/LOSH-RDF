Basically, the pump does not move enough volume upwards to outweigh the rate that water can seep through gaps between rotor and stator.  

Applications of both silicone and plasti-dipÂ® were attempted to increase the seal between rotor and stator, but both were stripped away in a relatively small number of rotations.""" ;
