function = "This is an extra height version of Adafruit's Pi Box so that there is room to add a RaspyJuice board over the GPIO pins with extra slots for the servo leads and power leads to fit in.\r\n\r\nThe RaspyJuice is an 'add-on' board for the Raspberry Pi which makes it easy to power by battery and drive servos. See http://code.google.com/p/raspy-juice/ for more details.\r\n\r\nI had it cut by http://www.razorlab.co.uk so the .svg file is on their template and design guidelines.\r\n\r\nBased on:\r\n\r\nAdafruit Pi Box - Enclosure for Raspberry PiÂ® Computers\r\n\r\nadafruit.com/products/859\r\n\r\nAdafruit invests time and resources providing this open source design, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!\r\n\r\nCreative Commons Attribution, Share-Alike"
