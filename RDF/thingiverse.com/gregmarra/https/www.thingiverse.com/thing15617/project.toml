function = "These toothbrush attach with 3M Command hook adhesive strips so they won't damage walls. They fit the strip from 3M Decorating Clips very well. ( http://www.amazon.com/Command-17026-VP-Decorating-Clips-Strips/dp/B000M3YGHS/ )\r\n\r\nThe holder is a little bit narrow, so some toothbrushes are a tighter fit than I'd like. Revision 2 would widen the base oval about a half centimeter without opening the holder neck width so more brushes fit nicely.\r\n\r\nI was inspired by dezbot's toothbrush holder ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9056 ), but wanted a version that mounted via 3M Command strip instead of a screw. In particular, borrowed dezbot's clever lofting to retain the brushes without them falling out."
