    okh:function """I often stream video of my CupCake in action (especially when I'm printing objects for friends) and wanted a way to mount the webcam so it followed the action.\r
\r
I came up with this very simple design in OpenSCAD.  It needs some adjusting as the slot for the cam was a little tight (although it held the cam firmly) and the base was a little thin (so I wrapped it in a layer of duct tape).  All the sizes are set by parameters so it should be easy to tweak.\r
\r
I thought the cam might shake with the movement but it didn't as far as I could tell.  Because the cam is mounted on the X-axis it makes the extruder look like it's moving left and right as well as up and down.\r
\r
The only other problem is that this model of cam only has a fixed focus.  As you can see from the action shot it looks like it's focused on the HBP wires at the back.  I might try redesigning it to make the cam sit a bit higher and further away from the build platform.\r
\r
I don't want it to be too high however as its current size makes it easy to fold up and stay mounted but out of the way when not in use or when needing to access the build platform.\r
\r
Another idea would be to mount it on the back of the X-Stage.  That way it could be taller without getting in the way.  A mashup between this and reprapperMC's mount (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8571) could be in order. :)""" ;
