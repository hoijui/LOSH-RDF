    okh:function """I really like imtiaz's Cell Phone Mount but didn't want to have to glue the clip on so I merged it with the top plate to create this part.\r
\r
The top plate (01_Top.stl) printed fine for me on its own but OpenSCAD doesn't like its winding order so I had to upload it to http://cloud.netfabb.com before OpenSCAD would render it.  I've included 01_Top_fixed.stl but you'll only need it if you want to modify the .scad file.\r
\r
Like tbuser commented I also had to upload 04_Left.stl to http://cloud.netfabb.com to get it to print properly.  I've uploaded the fixed file to save other people the trouble.\r
\r
Big thanks go to imtiaz for making this awesome thing.""" ;
