function: "I recently printed the awesome Stormtrooper (thingiverse.com/thing:588) and Darth Vader (thingiverse.com/thing:7215) heads and wanted to give Yoda a platform to match.\r\n\r\nI imported Yoda along with Darth Vader into OpenSCAD and was quickly able to scale Yoda down and add a platform to suit.  Unfortunately I couldn't get OpenSCAD to render Yoda so I was a bit stuck.  After trying cloud.netfabb.com and then playing with Meshlab for ages I still couldn't get the model to render and I have no idea how to use Blender. :(\r\n\r\nI was about to give up when I realised I could just print the platform I'd designed and then print Yoda separately on top.  It worked a treat! :)"
