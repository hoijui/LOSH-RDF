function: "While I was unpacking the dishwasher my wife overheard me complaining about the little wheels that are constantly falling off the bottom rack.  She commented sourly that it served me right since I had made rude remarks many times about how she must be doing something wrong to cause the wheels to fall off.\r\n\r\nSensing I was now close to being in the dog-box I thought about my options for rebuttal. It was clear that I couldn't win the argument or claim I never said those things so my only option was to apologise. If only I could find a way to redeem myself instead...\r\n\r\nI hatched a cunning plan. I would finally figure out how to print replacement clips to hold the wheels on. This would not only fix the dishwasher issue and keep me out of the dog-box but would also further cement the usefulness of 3D printing in her eyes. :-D\r\n\r\nMy first challenge was coming up with a design that was printable since the original clip has a pin that would have required support.  I opted for a two-piece design by replacing the pin with a tack from tbuser's awesome Pin Connectors V2 library. The parts are quite small so my initial prints ended up as blobby messes.  However by using Multiply to print four at a time it gave each layer enough time to cool.\r\n\r\nThe replacement clips are working perfectly so far and have survived their first run through the dishwasher.  Needless to say my wife is very pleased and all is forgiven. :)"
