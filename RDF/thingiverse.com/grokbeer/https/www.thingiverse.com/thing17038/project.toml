function = "I started out simply wanting to print a giant bread tag for a friend.  Little did I know that an entire taxonomy exists for the parasitoids known as Occlupanid (Occlu = to close, pan = bread).\r\n\r\nThe most thorough research into these organisms has been conducted by the Holotypic Occlupanid Research Group - http://www.horg.com/horg.  Their work was even used in the report \"Plastic bag clip discovered in partial colectomy accompanying proposal for phylogenic plastic bag clip classification\" published in the BMJ Case Reports journal: http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2011/bcr.02.2011.3869.abstract.\r\n\r\nWhile the SCAD file is parametric so far I have only designed (bred?) one example of the Toxodenta (curved teeth) order, based on an example I found in the wild which appears to conform to the classification of Palpatophora utiliformis - http://www.horg.com/horg/Palpatophora_utiliformis.htm.\r\n\r\nI intend to extend the SCAD file to include examples of species from each order.  I also encourage people to create their own variations and mutations.  Let's see if we can get these creatures to evolve into something new! ;-)"
