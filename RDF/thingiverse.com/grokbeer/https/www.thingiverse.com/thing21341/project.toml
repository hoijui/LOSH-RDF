function = "For some reason my bottle of Earthwise Dishwasher Powder was missing a spout in the neck of the bottle.  This might have been intentional but I found it hard to pour the correct amount so decided to print it a spout.\r\n\r\nWARNING: If you print this make sure it ends up sitting flush with the top of the neck otherwise it may stop the cap from being child-proof."
