function = "The inside handle on my front door broke off.  I could use my finger to open it but I wanted a way of forcing it to stay open.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt was a 16mm x 70mm tube (inside diameter 10mm).  Unfortunately it wasn't quite wide enough to hold the catch open fully so instead I printed this little two-tone cone to jam into the catch.\r\n\r\nIt fit perfectly and did the trick!\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever 3D design and also my first time using OpenSCAD.  I'm mainly documenting this on Thingiverse for my own record but I'm releasing the files into the public domain so anyone is free to do what they like with them.\r\n\r\nI've also uploaded a version 2 of the cone.  I wanted to keep the cone manifold while ensuring the wall thickness stays at a constant 3mm.  The first version was manifold by having the inner cone longer than the outer cone but the downside of that is the inner and outer walls aren't totally parallel so the wall thickness won't be constant.\r\n\r\nComments appreciated I'm still getting to grips with OpenSCAD."
