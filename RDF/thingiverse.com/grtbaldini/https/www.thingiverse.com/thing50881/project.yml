function: This is nothing special but needed a clamp to mount a adjustment screw for the Z End Stop. This Thing is a derivative from AlephObjects Z Clamp included with their printer but I just saw a picture of it and made what I needed for my machine. And if someone can find a use for it on their machine, that's great!
