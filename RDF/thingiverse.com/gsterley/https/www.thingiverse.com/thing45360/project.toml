function = "This is a collapsible phone holder for a Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It's base is intended to fit into the credit card holder located inside the dash compartment of my 2006 Scion xB. The whole unit can fold away into the compartment when not in use.   \n\n\n\nIf you aren't lucky enough to have a Scion...  it could very easily be VHB taped or velcro'd to any flat surface in your auto. If all else fails, it makes for a sturdy, adjustable stand."
