    okh:function """I made a few modifications to simonkuehling's x carriage so that it would fit on my MendelMax better.  These modifications include: shifting the belt clamps over so the belts are in a straight line with the pulley and moving the belt clamps farther apart so that the belt can be tensioned more easily.  I also used the beefier (3mm thick) version of jonaskuehling's LM8UU clamps, and added a tab with holes in it to mount a printed opto-flag.\r
\r
I've tried to keep it as parametric as possible.  There is a boolean for the opto flag in the scad file, so just change it from 1 to 0 if you don't want that tab on there.""" ;
