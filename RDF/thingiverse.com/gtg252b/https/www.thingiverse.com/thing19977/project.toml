function = "I added an arm and a tube clamp to \r\nDaveStruve's universal Contour mount so that I could mount my Contour camera to my mountain bike facing backwards.  It makes for some really cool videos when you're bombing down a section of trail with another rider behind you.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tested the mount out on a 15 mile ride today with some reasonably rough terrain, and it was rock solid."
