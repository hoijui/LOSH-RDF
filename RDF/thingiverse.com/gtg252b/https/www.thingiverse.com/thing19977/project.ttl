DaveStruve's universal Contour mount so that I could mount my Contour camera to my mountain bike facing backwards.  It makes for some really cool videos when you're bombing down a section of trail with another rider behind you.\r
\r
\r
I tested the mount out on a 15 mile ride today with some reasonably rough terrain, and it was rock solid.""" ;
