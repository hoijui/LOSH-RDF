function: "A (very) old vacuum cleaner had a broken attachment that joins the main unit to the hose.\r\n\r\nMeasured and designed the profile of the part in sketchup, did a 'Follow Me' to make it a cylinder, then exported to STL, printed on a Replicator and voila... problem solved.\r\n\r\nPS: This video helped with using the Follow Me tool in Sketchup: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL7jvE9So6c"
