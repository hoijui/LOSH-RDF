function: "A tool holder with slots for SD cards, hex wrenches (aka allen keys), screwdrivers, pliers, side-cutters, scissors, pens, etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough I keep post-it notes, a scalpel and digital verniers in it too, I wouldn't recommend doing so as their slots are not designed well and could do with improvements.\r\n\r\nDerived from Replicator thing:23520 by MangoT21, except this one if free-standing.  SketchUp design also uploaded."
