function = "I made this using 3d heightmaps of a mjolnir image I found online. I printed it in glow-in-the-dark PLA and wear it on a steel chain.\r\n\r\nThe original STL was so detailed that my Slic3r just couldn't handle it. I had to decimate it 90% using blender and fix the holes this generated in netfabb. In the end though, I'm very pleased how it turned out!"
