function: 'My wife has been wanting a better way to store her hair dryer under her sink so that it doesn''t just add to all the clutter.  She was open to any solution, so this is what I came up with yesterday:  a 1/4-inch acrylic mount for it that attaches under the sink.  Wrap the cord around the barrel and it all stashes away neatly and conveniently.'
