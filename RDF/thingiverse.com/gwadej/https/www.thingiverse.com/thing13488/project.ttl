A few months ago, I realized that it would be easy to make a better stirrer with my MakerBot. I also used this project to begin doing simple design with OpenSCAD. This is the best of the designs I've managed so far.\r

UPDATE: Uploaded new STL to see if it would display now. Still getting a blank image display.""" ;
