function: "One of my wife's hobbies is calligraphy. (See Debbie Campbell's Calligraphy at http://anomaly.org/debbie/calligraphy/) She also mixes inks for special projects. She makes the inks in relatively small batches and stirring the mixture with a toothpick was not very effective.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, I realized that it would be easy to make a better stirrer with my MakerBot. I also used this project to begin doing simple design with OpenSCAD. This is the best of the designs I've managed so far.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Uploaded new STL to see if it would display now. Still getting a blank image display."
