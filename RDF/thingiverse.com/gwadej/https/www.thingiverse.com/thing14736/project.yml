function: "A co-worker was talking about an idea for a wrist-mounted computer she was thinking about. I saw http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1748 provided a decent platform for the idea. We just needed something to attach to it.\r\n\r\nUsing jag's dovetail library (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10269) and a bit of experimentation, I made this. The dovetail is long enough to work with either one or two of the wrist mounts."
