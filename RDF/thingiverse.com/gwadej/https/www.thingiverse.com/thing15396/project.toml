function = "This model is my first attempt to create an Aurora-class Starfury (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfury) from the television show Babylon 5. I've always liked the design of this one-man fighter craft and decided that it would be a fun and challenging design project.\r\n\r\nThe included STL files were designed for efficiency of printing and assembling a single model. You can use the included OpenSCAD files to print individual parts or make modifications. I hope to make the OpenSCAD files easier to modify at some point.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a pretty good first attempt, there are several features that are not quite correct.\r\n\r\n1. The upper supports are much simpler than they should be.\r\n2. The forward guns are not as well-formed and sturdy as I would like.\r\n3. The detail on the sides of the body could use some work.\r\n4. The back of the model has no detail at all.\r\n\r\nAs my design skills improve, I hope to revisit this model.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The instructions have been improved and the extra thruster nozzles have been removed from the engines4 model."
