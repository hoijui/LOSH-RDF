    okh:function """This model is my first attempt to create an Aurora-class Starfury (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfury) from the television show Babylon 5. I've always liked the design of this one-man fighter craft and decided that it would be a fun and challenging design project.\r
\r
The included STL files were designed for efficiency of printing and assembling a single model. You can use the included OpenSCAD files to print individual parts or make modifications. I hope to make the OpenSCAD files easier to modify at some point.\r
\r
Although this is a pretty good first attempt, there are several features that are not quite correct.\r
\r
1. The upper supports are much simpler than they should be.\r
2. The forward guns are not as well-formed and sturdy as I would like.\r
3. The detail on the sides of the body could use some work.\r
4. The back of the model has no detail at all.\r
\r
As my design skills improve, I hope to revisit this model.\r
\r
UPDATE: The instructions have been improved and the extra thruster nozzles have been removed from the engines4 model.""" ;
