function = "I printed Ellindsey's TOM build platform cable management system (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16069), because I wanted better strain relied than I had been using. Unfortunately, I found two problems. First, the cable from the HBP would not reach the side of the Y axis and back to the front right corner of my TOM. Second, I had already added MakeALot's Linear Bearing X Axis Carriage for ToM (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9420), so there were no vertical ribs to attach the x stage mount to.\r\n\r\nSo, I used OpenSCAD to generate a few new parts to make the system work on my TOM."
