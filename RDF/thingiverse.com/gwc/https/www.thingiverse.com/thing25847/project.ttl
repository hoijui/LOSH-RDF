\r
\r
This is a parametric Drawer Set. In front of the drawers you can put a customizable piece or cover (that is glued to the rest of the drawer) and where you can put your logo or anything you fancy. This also serves as the drawer's handle.\r
\r
The files CoverCajon (yes I'm spanish) are examples made with SolidEdge for this piece with several designs, from the Apple logo, to the RepRap Logo.\r
\r
Update 29 Jun: I've made an update, for the precission of the rounded corners and all circle-shaped holes. I wasn't very pleased with the result so I added a new parameter to specify the number of sides (precission) of this shapes.""" ;
