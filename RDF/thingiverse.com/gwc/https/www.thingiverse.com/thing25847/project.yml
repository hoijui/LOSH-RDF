function: "This is my first Parametric object (in fact the first think I've done with OpenScad), and also my first entry into Thingiverse, so don't be too hard on me :p\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a parametric Drawer Set. In front of the drawers you can put a customizable piece or cover (that is glued to the rest of the drawer) and where you can put your logo or anything you fancy. This also serves as the drawer's handle.\r\n\r\nThe files CoverCajon (yes I'm spanish) are examples made with SolidEdge for this piece with several designs, from the Apple logo, to the RepRap Logo.\r\n\r\nUpdate 29 Jun: I've made an update, for the precission of the rounded corners and all circle-shaped holes. I wasn't very pleased with the result so I added a new parameter to specify the number of sides (precission) of this shapes."
