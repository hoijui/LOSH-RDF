    okh:function """This is the TinyFan a fan (and fun) driver that controls up to 4 12V fans using just an ATTiny45 or ATTiny8, 4 tactile switches and some electronic components (most general use, aka cheap).\r
\r
The programming of the ATTiny has the folowing capabilities:\r
+ Can use PWM in 2 of the outputs (labeled 1 and 2)\r
+ The tactlie switches have a secondary (special) function if held during 2 seconds.\r
+ The program can use EEPROM memory to save last state in the chip. Also, if you don't want this feature, you can disable it.\r
\r
Also you have available two designs: Prefboard or PCB.\r
\r
Watch it in action! http://goo.gl/UIM2Z (G+ album)\r

Update 15 Aug 2012 (00:00)\r
Improved the programming. Now memory is only rewrited after a state sticks for 2 seconds (saving writes while changing the PWM state), and also the code has been reduced (1.96KB without EEPROM, 2.27KB with EEPROM).""" ;
