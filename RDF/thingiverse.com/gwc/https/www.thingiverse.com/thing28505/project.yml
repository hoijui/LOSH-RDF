function: "This is the TinyFan a fan (and fun) driver that controls up to 4 12V fans using just an ATTiny45 or ATTiny8, 4 tactile switches and some electronic components (most general use, aka cheap).\r\n\r\nThe programming of the ATTiny has the folowing capabilities:\r\n+ Can use PWM in 2 of the outputs (labeled 1 and 2)\r\n+ The tactlie switches have a secondary (special) function if held during 2 seconds.\r\n+ The program can use EEPROM memory to save last state in the chip. Also, if you don't want this feature, you can disable it.\r\n\r\nAlso you have available two designs: Prefboard or PCB.\r\n\r\nWatch it in action! http://goo.gl/UIM2Z (G+ album)\r\n\r\nThis thing was made by:\r\nFrancisco Malpartida\r\nG.W.C.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Iceflow.\r\n\r\nUpdate 15 Aug 2012 (00:00)\r\nImproved the programming. Now memory is only rewrited after a state sticks for 2 seconds (saving writes while changing the PWM state), and also the code has been reduced (1.96KB without EEPROM, 2.27KB with EEPROM)."
