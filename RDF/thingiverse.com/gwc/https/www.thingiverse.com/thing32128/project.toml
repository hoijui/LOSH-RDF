function = "I had some problems printing the Iris Door Box work with those tiny potrusions of plastic acting as guides (they just kept breaking), so I made a derivative with holes and M3 screws and bolts that uses the bottom of the hole as the guide.\r\n\r\nOnly the box is modified, not the leaves nor the ring. Indeed the box looks just the same from the outside (except the bottom that has extra holes and extra screws :p)\r\n\r\nThank you, countspatula, for making such an awesome yet simple box, I've always wanted to have one!\r\n\r\nAll the credit to countspatula!"
