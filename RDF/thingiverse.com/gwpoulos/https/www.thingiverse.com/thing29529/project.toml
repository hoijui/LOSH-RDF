function = "This is a derivative of scottmayson's Z-Axis Adjuster for the ultimaker (thing 19912). I found that the original z-axis adjuster body was a little too short for the full adjustment range for my Ultimaker, so I lengthened the body by 10 mm.  The other parts are all the same.  \r\n\r\nSince I am not yet adept at modelling, I just used netfabb basic to cut the original model into 3 parts and elongated the middle body part. After aligning the three parts, I exported each of  the STL's from netfabb, imported them into Meshlab, combined them into one mesh and simplified the mesh.  \r\n\r\nAs a final step I sent the whole thing to the Netfabb cloud service for cleaning (http://cloud.netfabb.com/)."
