function = "I made this for a walk-in shower door handle that kept hitting the tile wall behind it, thus chipping the wall. Now the bumper hits the wall, which is \"softer\" than the metal, and no longer chips the tile.\r\n\r\nIt is a very tight fit over the handle, which is desired. Once in place, it can turn around the handle if needed to get the best angle against the wall behind the door.\r\n\r\nStory here: http://wp.me/p2hTaI-2g"
