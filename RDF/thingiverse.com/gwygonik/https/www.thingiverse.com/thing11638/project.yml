function: "My walk-in shower door is hung incorrectly. Consequently it leaks water underneath it. I said \"I can fix that!\" This is an attempt at a solution.\r\n\r\nI think this thing is best used as inspiration (or a warning) and not as an actual printed object, but you are free to do with it as you please.\r\n\r\nMore info, pics, and thoughts here: http://wp.me/p2hTaI-1G"
