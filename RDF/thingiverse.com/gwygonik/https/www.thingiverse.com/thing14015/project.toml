function = "This is a small (tiny!) clip that slides around the cable on a pair of headphones, then slides over the front placket of a shirt (the part where buttons go).\r\n\r\nThis holds the headphones in-place between this clip and the wearer's ears, allowing freedom of movement without constantly pulling on the headphones.\r\n\r\nI designed this as a test to see if something this small and detailed could be printed with any degree of success. In addition, it is a cool thing to make and use with all those white earbuds out there.\r\n\r\nMore back-story and details here: http://wp.me/p2hTaI-P\r\n\r\nWith the original attempt here: http://wp.me/p2hTaI-U"
