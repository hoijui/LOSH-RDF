function = "Recently, while looking for how to best make a salsa-jar snow globe, I saw that a lot of people were turning juice boxes into boats and other cute objects by using stickers or paper. And I thought: \"Wait a minute! What if I printed pieces for juice boxes? What if you could mix and match the pieces too?!\"\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, I was unable to find a commercial product that did this. This seems like a gold-mine to some mass-produced toy company (which is why I was going to set the license to non-commercial, but decided that if folks wanted to make and sell on Shapeways or similar, feel free :-)\r\n\r\nI was going to title these \"juice box heroes\", but there is a musical band by that name (apparently doing children-friendly versions of classic songs). Given that I made an owl with goggles on, \"weirdos\" is more appropriate.\r\n\r\nMore info and pictures at my blog: http://wp.me/p2hTaI-M\r\n\r\nThese are more for sparking imagination than being \"things\" on their own. Which is why I've included a plain, basic end-cap for YOU to make your own things on: pirate ships, aircraft carriers, cats, alligators, dinosaurs, mars rovers, you name it!\r\n\r\nI have included all the SketchUp files to use as a launching point."
