function = "Finally, after almost a year, I had to disassemble my ToM's HBP to fix the infamous melted power pin. After putting it all back together my platform was wickedly out of level. \r\n\r\nLuckily for me, some time ago I had downloaded FAMULUS's \"HBP Quick Leveler Redux\" wheel 9-up plate and modified it to not have the large number of curves, rounded edges, and notches of the original. I just wanted something simple that RepG would slice in a few minutes, not the 20 or so minutes FAMULUS's plate was taking.\r\n\r\nBecause I was lazy, I used FAMULUS's STL for the screw and nut hole, and just built a new surrounding bit. I put a 9-up plate together and it sliced in around 3 minutes; estimated print time 19 minutes. This I could deal with :-)\r\n\r\nThis really is a great thing and any version should be part of every ToM owner's machine."
