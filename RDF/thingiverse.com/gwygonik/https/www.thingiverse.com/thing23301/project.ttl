\r
Luckily for me, some time ago I had downloaded FAMULUS's "HBP Quick Leveler Redux" wheel 9-up plate and modified it to not have the large number of curves, rounded edges, and notches of the original. I just wanted something simple that RepG would slice in a few minutes, not the 20 or so minutes FAMULUS's plate was taking.\r
\r
Because I was lazy, I used FAMULUS's STL for the screw and nut hole, and just built a new surrounding bit. I put a 9-up plate together and it sliced in around 3 minutes; estimated print time 19 minutes. This I could deal with :-)\r
\r
This really is a great thing and any version should be part of every ToM owner's machine.""" ;
