    okh:function """This is a Processing app that will load a JPEG or PNG, convert it to a halftone image (with many parameters), and output a STL[1] or OpenSCAD[2] file.\r
\r
Make cool halftone coasters. Use them as plastic "rubber" stamps. Make art!\r
\r
This app was a result of a question posed on the Makerbot Operators Google group, and was written in 10-12 hours over the course of a few days. Feel free to take it and add features or make a standalone app or whatever.\r
\r
You can download the source as well as packaged executables for Windows, OSX, and Linux.[3]\r
\r
DISCLAIMER: This app is presented as-is and does not come with ANY support. (No time for that here, sorry)\r
\r
NOTE 1 - the resulting STL files MUST be run through a post-processing app like Netfabb to create printable models.\r
\r
NOTE 2 - the resulting OpenSCAD files can take a REALLY LONG TIME to render in OpenSCAD before you can save a STL from there.\r
\r
NOTE 3 - I've only tested the OSX executable (which works fine), but not the Windows or Linux ones. I've mostly run from source.""" ;
