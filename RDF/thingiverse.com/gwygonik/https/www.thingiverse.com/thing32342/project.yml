function: "This is a Processing app that will load a JPEG or PNG, convert it to a halftone image (with many parameters), and output a STL[1] or OpenSCAD[2] file.\r\n\r\nMake cool halftone coasters. Use them as plastic \"rubber\" stamps. Make art!\r\n\r\nThis app was a result of a question posed on the Makerbot Operators Google group, and was written in 10-12 hours over the course of a few days. Feel free to take it and add features or make a standalone app or whatever.\r\n\r\nYou can download the source as well as packaged executables for Windows, OSX, and Linux.[3]\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This app is presented as-is and does not come with ANY support. (No time for that here, sorry)\r\n\r\nNOTE 1 - the resulting STL files MUST be run through a post-processing app like Netfabb to create printable models.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2 - the resulting OpenSCAD files can take a REALLY LONG TIME to render in OpenSCAD before you can save a STL from there.\r\n\r\nNOTE 3 - I've only tested the OSX executable (which works fine), but not the Windows or Linux ones. I've mostly run from source."
