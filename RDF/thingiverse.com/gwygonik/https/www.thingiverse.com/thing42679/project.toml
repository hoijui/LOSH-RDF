function = "We have sliding \"bypass\" doors in our house. One of the guides -- the things that keep the doors from rocking in or out while hanging on the track -- had a broken plastic tab. \r\n\r\nI could have bought a whole new guide set -- the plastic guide itself and the metal plate that holds the guide to the floor -- or redesign and print both parts, but these options would be a waste of a perfectly fine piece of metal. So the plastic guide piece is it."
