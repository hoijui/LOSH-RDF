function = "Designed an extruder mount for the new Universal Extruder from this kickstarter project  \n\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qu-bd/open-source-universal-3d-printer-extruder-dual-ext  \n\nThere are some issues with this mount. One is that the fan is very close to the wall which may affect the cooling of the heatsink. If I were to extend even further, I may strain the Z axis rod due to torque.   \n\nI am not sure if this will work with the double extruder version since the mount is different.  \n\nDesigned in Solidworks 2009  \n\n**Update**   \n5/26/2013  \nUploaded ver2. This version requires the QU-BD MBE extruder to be oriented parallel to the mounting plate versus the original perpendicular mount. You can view my blog as a reference to see how it's mounted. You will need to cut slots into the mounting plate since none of the mounting holes are 50mm apart like the Wade Extruder.  \n\n**Update**  \n7/19/2013  \nFinally got my QU-BD installed on the PB+, posted some pictures. Going to make a blog post on how to install the QU-BD parallel to the universal mount.   \n\nExtruder lever mod by mickb  \nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:43411"
