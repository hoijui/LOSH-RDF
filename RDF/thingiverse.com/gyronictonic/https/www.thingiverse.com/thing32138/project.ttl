http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qu-bd/open-source-universal-3d-printer-extruder-dual-ext  

There are some issues with this mount. One is that the fan is very close to the wall which may affect the cooling of the heatsink. If I were to extend even further, I may strain the Z axis rod due to torque.   

I am not sure if this will work with the double extruder version since the mount is different.  

Designed in Solidworks 2009

Uploaded ver2. This version requires the QU-BD MBE extruder to be oriented parallel to the mounting plate versus the original perpendicular mount. You can view my blog as a reference to see how it's mounted. You will need to cut slots into the mounting plate since none of the mounting holes are 50mm apart like the Wade Extruder.

Finally got my QU-BD installed on the PB+, posted some pictures. Going to make a blog post on how to install the QU-BD parallel to the universal mount.
