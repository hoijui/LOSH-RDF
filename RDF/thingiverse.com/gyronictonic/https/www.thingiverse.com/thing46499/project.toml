function = "Printrbot Stabilizer mounted at the top of the Z -axis. Not sure if it reduces Z wobble but may provide more frame rigidity. I have no issues with Z wobble but if you're playing around with acceleration, doesn't hurt to add this.  \n\nProvided both 8mm and 12mm mount for the Printrbot and Printrbot Plus.  \n\nCan be clamped on and off for easier installation and the horizontal rod can be installed without threading through the parts."
