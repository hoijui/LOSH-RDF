function: "I was in need of a new centerplate for a quad. I wanted one for 45mm and 35mm controller. Also I needed to fix some FPV equipment and a plate for the lipo. So I designed this centerplate for use with 10x10mm and 15x15mm aluminium.\r\nI had it made from CFK 2mm and it is rocksolid and unbreakable.\r\nUnits in mm"
