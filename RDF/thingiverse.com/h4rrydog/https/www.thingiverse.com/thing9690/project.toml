function = "Hello World! (My first Thingiverse upload.)\r\n\r\nThis is a printable, interlocking drying mat. 3D print / lasercut as many as you like and connect them together.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n\r\nV2\r\n- Shelled the object (1.5mm wall) to reduce material usage and shrinkage when printing by FDM. \r\n- Kept the bottom face (which tends to be smooth when printed on a heated platform) because it looks nice (to me). If you want to laser cut the part, remove this face or just take the top profile as your cut pattern. You may need to add a few more ribs to better connect the interior features to the outside loop of material. ;)\r\n\r\nV1\r\nHello World!"
