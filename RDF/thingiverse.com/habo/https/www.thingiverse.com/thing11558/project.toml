function = "A sentence clock, full box edition with LED mounting layer. (German words edition)\r\n\r\nExample: ES IST ZEHN NACH HALB DREI UHR\r\nWhich means: IT IS TWENTY TO FOUR OCLOCK\r\n\r\nSo the LEDs illuminate the words and you see the time as sentence.\r\n\r\nI used 4mm plywood and 3mm LEDs. Holes for mounting and the power cable is included.\r\n\r\nAlex just send me a modification, so I added \"v2\" to the new files."
