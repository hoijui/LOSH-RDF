function: "One of my Prusa Mendle Y-Axis [Smooth] Bar Clamps cracked as a result of it being slightly over-tightened while building my printer. The printer's been performing just fine, but I recently I wanted to upgrade the Y-axis PLA bushings to LM8UUs and,\r\na) didn't want to risk the cracked bar clamp failing completely during upgrade, and\r\nb) didn't want to start tearing the whole printer apart for the sake of ONE bar clamp.\r\n\r\nSo here's a bar clamp that:\r\n* is easy to retro-fit without disassembling your Y-axis,\r\n* has a 'developed' surface, (vs a simple hole) to clamp around the smooth rod, which together with the clamp arms being wider at their base, makes this clamp almost incapable of being overtightened,\r\n* has an 'anti-twist' tooth and socket feature which positively locks together the clamping 'arms' during installation. This effectively prevents the outward displacement of the clamping arms that otherwise occurs when tightening an 'asymmetric style clamp' such as this.\r\n\r\nDESIGNED FOR:\r\nMating 8mm threaded and smooth rods. (Prusa Mendel, etc)\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nCompared to the standard Prusa Mendle Bar Clamp, the distance between centres of the smooth and threaded rod will be reduced after fitting the version 9-0-X of this thing. Two further versions exist which will be finalised and uploaded when I get around to it: 9-1-X and 9-2-X which provide approx 1 and 2 mm extra separation respectively, between threaded and smooth rods.\r\n\r\n-X only denotes 'plain' (-0) or 'chamfered' (-1) corner on each of the clamp arms.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress only in that the 9-1-X and 9-2-X versions are not yet complete; 9-0-X is fully functional.\r\n\r\nCREATED WITH:\r\nMoI3D\r\n\r\nMORE IMAGES:\r\nhttp://bit.ly/hk00039-009-0-1_bar-clamp_twist-on_Images\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n* Compared to the standard Prusa Mendle Bar Clamp, the distance between centres of the smooth and threaded rod will be reduced after fitting Bar Clamp - Twist On v9.0.X. Two further versions exist which will be finalised and uploaded as time permits, 9.1.X and 9.2.X which provide approx 1 and 2 mm (respectively) extra separation.\r\n* Test printed/fitted in PLA only. ABS should also be good, if not better.\r\n* A unit piece has been tested to failure and experience would suggest that it's more than capable of replacing an original Prusa Mendel Y-Axis bar clamp.\r\n\r\nDerived from: Prusa's bar clamp.stl"
