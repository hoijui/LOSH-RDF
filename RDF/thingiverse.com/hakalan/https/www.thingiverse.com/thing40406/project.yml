function: "A pen or pencil holder in the hyperboloidian fashion. Not that there is a lack of such here, but... well... \r\n \r\nAnyway, after inserting the pens, my daughter immediately put it on top of her head and decided it was a crown, hence the name.\r\n\r\nNote that such a move is a bad idea unless the fit is tight, because the pens will slide down."
