function = "Minor tweaks to Greg's Hinged Accessible Extruder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8252 in order to allow using the makergear hotend with the wooden plate they provide.\r\n\r\nThe wooden plate is off center mounted by 3mm, which required a slight tweak of the base leadout and the motor mount angle to fit. It is also adjusted for 1.75mm filament.\r\n\r\nNone of the changes are destructive, you can easily get the stock extruder by setting mount_offset=0 and angle_offset=0."
