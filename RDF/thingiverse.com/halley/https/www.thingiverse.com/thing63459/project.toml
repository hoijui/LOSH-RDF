function = "I thought I had my printer dialed in well, but I still had trouble fitting and sliding the original lid, so I made a new version in Blender.  The bumps are smaller and sharper, which fit into my box cups better.\r\n\r\nThis is just an improved lid.  I don't include the maze itself.  See the original A-Mazing Box maze cup at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1481 or make your own."
