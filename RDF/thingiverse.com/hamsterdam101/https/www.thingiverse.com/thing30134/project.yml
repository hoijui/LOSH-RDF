function: "I recently picked up an old vinyl cutter on the cheap. I wanted to be able to use it to draw with a sharpie, unfortunately, the top of the cutter prevented this. As such, I made a mount to angle the pen out.\r\n\r\nI think my cutter is an earlier model of the refine vinyl cutters (it uses the same driver and looks similar) so it should work with them and other similar models as well."
