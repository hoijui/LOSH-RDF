function = "This is a derivitive of \"Platform Leveling Trick\" by ScribbleJ. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6545\r\nThis version uses stuff that I had lying around the house. It uses springs out of a mechanical pencil (which fit perfectly over the bolts), to make it easier to level the build platform. It might take a little bit of the stress of the extruder nozzle, to prevent it from breaking your extruder, if it is laying down too much plastic also."
