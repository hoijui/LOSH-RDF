Honestly I wasn't well planned for this robot. Most of parts were created according the idea goes.  \r\n\r\nI attached more photo for reference. You may notice I used \"epoxy-stik\" for stronger support on legs. From time to time the thinner part on leg were cracked. Perhaps I should update the thicker design."
