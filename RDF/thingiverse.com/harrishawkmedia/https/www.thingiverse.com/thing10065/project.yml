function: "This is the Rocket used in the official UP! 3D printer promo which we recently produced. Now that the film has been officially released by the Delta Micro factory Corporation we have decided to share our rocket with the good people of thingiverse. Our hope is to see versions of our rocket launched all over the world so please add pictures and videos of your launches. \r\n\r\nPlease also take the time to look at the new PP3DP Promotional Film by following the link below. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmkQCUJNooA\r\n\r\nENJOY!"
