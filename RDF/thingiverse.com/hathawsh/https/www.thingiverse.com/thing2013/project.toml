function = "My Mom likes gardening and flowers, so for her birthday, I printed a full size flower pot.  My machine isn\\'t yet very fast, so it took more than 24 hours, but the result was quite nice.\r\n\r\nThis pot doubles as a science experiment: since I printed in PLA, the pot just might decompose.  It will be fun to find out whether it does and how quickly.\r\n\r\nThe design is probably too big for a Makerbot, but you can scale it with OpenSCAD."
