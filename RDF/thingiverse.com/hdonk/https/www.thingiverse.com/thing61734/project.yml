function: "After trying to determine if size problems of inner features on a print were caused by miscalibration of the X or Y axis steps per mm, I came up with this.\r\nIt allows the measurement of head move distances by looking at the spacing between voids - that way if there's over or under extrusion, the measurements are of the voids."
