function = "It seems that everyone uses 50mm fans, it just so happens that i have a dozen or so 35mm fans laying about. Smaller the better in my mind. No need to over do it.\r\n\r\nThere are many mounts included in other parts, and i wanted to use my smaller fans in those locations.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using an arcol.hu hot end which i like very much. I think the design is great. It has a thermal break (PEEK) and even a simple heatsink on the cool end. even so, i've had some heat related failures about an hour or so into some big prints. Even with the heatsink, heat starts to creep up, though the hotend itself and also through the extruded material. having an extruder jam an hour into a big print is one of the most frustrating of failures, am i right?\r\n\r\nI needed to mount one of my fans and i could have blue-taped it and been effective, but why not keep it clean? This mount uses two of the mount holes for a 50mm fan and positions and directs the fan where i need it. \r\n\r\nI uploaded two versions, one offset, for my particular use, and a centered version which would work fine in most cases. \r\n\r\nnow the heatsink stays ice-cold (room temp really, poetic license, sue me) and i haven't had a heat related failure since."
