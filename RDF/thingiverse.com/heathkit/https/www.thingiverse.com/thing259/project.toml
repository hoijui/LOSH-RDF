function = "Here's a board I designed back in 2006.  At the time, I was obsessed with making easy to use controller modules in the smallest packages possible.  This control board should fit into a DIP44 socket.\r\n\r\nIncludes a nice LDO 5V regulator I found, and an onboard RS232 line converter.  The line voltage RS232 pins and the power and ground pins are on a screw terminal header, and just about everything is brought out to the pins on the bottom.  I tried to get as much IO as possible, but obviously there are some pins that didn't make it.  Includes ISP header, and also has the watch crystal for RTC.\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty neat board, and it can be assembled by hand for about $20."
