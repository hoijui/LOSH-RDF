    okh:function """Here's a board I designed back in 2006.  At the time, I was obsessed with making easy to use controller modules in the smallest packages possible.  This control board should fit into a DIP44 socket.\r
\r
Includes a nice LDO 5V regulator I found, and an onboard RS232 line converter.  The line voltage RS232 pins and the power and ground pins are on a screw terminal header, and just about everything is brought out to the pins on the bottom.  I tried to get as much IO as possible, but obviously there are some pins that didn't make it.  Includes ISP header, and also has the watch crystal for RTC.\r
\r
It's a pretty neat board, and it can be assembled by hand for about $20.""" ;
