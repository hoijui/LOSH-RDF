function: "I designed this around a spare motor i had laying around. I didnt have a servo for measurments or I would have made a mount for that.\r\n\r\nI have been updating this over the past few days. I will leave the older versions up for download. If you want the newest one look for the highest version number. \r\n\r\nMotor size is 25mmx20mm with a 2mm shaft."
