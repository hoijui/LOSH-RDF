function = "This stand/dock should work with any 10.1\" Tablet. You may have to scale it up a few % so that the tablet slides in easier. I'm uploading 2 versions. The first one is designed around the Transformer plug,  The 2nd one Is just a stand no plug hole . The 3rd one for ppl with smaller print beds. Just glue it together.\r\n\r\nThe 2 square things up front are optional spacers."
