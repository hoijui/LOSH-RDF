function = "I just added a 2nd middle piece that has a built in bubbler.  \n\n\n\nI Made it modular so you can make it as long as you like.   \n\n\n\nThe first one has a 12mm downpipe so that you can use a glass downpipe & slide. This is to prevent the hot slide from melting the plastic downpipe.  \n\n\n\nThe 2nd one takes 9mm slides directly.  \n\n\n\nJust add your own 9mm glass slide. This can be acquired at any headshop.  \n\n\n\nI made the downpipe to be printed as one piece, there are vent holes at the botom for the smoke. This should print with no supports.  \n\n\n\nPlease let me know if there are any problems printing this."
