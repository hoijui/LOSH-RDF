function: "COD Black Ops Zombies Ray Gun\r\n\r\nI suggest printing with supports.\r\n\r\nThe last 3 files named v7 are for people having problems printing this.\r\n\r\nv8 is more optimized for 3D printing. I replaced the tubing with bigger tubing and removed the sight. This should be printable without supports now.\r\n\r\nMy printer was catching on the long things on the back and knocking them over causing a failed print. Now you just have to print it in 3 parts and glue together. :D\r\n\r\nScale to 3x for near life size."
