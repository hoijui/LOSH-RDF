function: Based on the research of Robert Full, this tiny sheet of plastic has even tinier hairs. Not tested yet, but based on proven research. A gecko's foot uses microscopic hairs to stick to surfaces by creating a kind of a super friction. This object does the same thing, only on a smaller scale. This sheet of plastic has 224 tiny spires, and is only a few square millimeters.
