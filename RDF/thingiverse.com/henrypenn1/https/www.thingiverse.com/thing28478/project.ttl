    okh:function "Based on the research of Robert Full, this tiny sheet of plastic has even tinier hairs. Not tested yet, but based on proven research. A gecko's foot uses microscopic hairs to stick to surfaces by creating a kind of a super friction. This object does the same thing, only on a smaller scale. This sheet of plastic has 1,000 tiny spires, and is only 6 square millimeters. Though not as strong as the force from a gecko's foot, the amount of hairs on a gecko's foot can hold up 250 pounds. Considering that, this should still be able to hold up a decent amount. From the information that I have received, I think it should print, but there are no guarantees." ;
