\r
Of course, many of you will not happen to need a knob with a mattson mini modular logo on top, but here are some reasons why this might be a good starting point for your own projects:\r
\r
the model has a tapered opening to account for the slight bulging that can happen at the bottom of prints, ensuring that the knobs are not "crazy tight" at the bottom of the print but yet too loose at top.  instead, with the tapering, i have printed, seriously, like a hundred of these things and they all slip on easily and then achieve a good grip.  (there were just one or two out of the bunch that ended up being TOO loose, but pretty good reject rate methinks)\r
\r
the knobs have 2 internal ribs to help grab hold of fluted shafts\r
\r
the outside part of the knobs have easy-grip fluting with a "large rib" for designating where they are pointing.\r
\r
the logo itself gives an easy visual aid as to orientation.\r
\r
in case you are wondering, what the $#$@# is a "mattson mini modular," they are my fave manufacturer of electronic synth modules... http://www.mattsonminimodular.com\r
\r
they are usually used for electronic music, but can be used for other kinds of music as well (this is what i do with the modules) http://thenewlines.bandcamp.com\r
