function: "i added a rib to supplement the stiffness of claudio del valle's excellent thumbpick design, and also rounded some of the corners...  \r\n\r\ni also created a simple finger pick, which i left a bit thick to accommodate a healthy amount of sanding which i think is key to minimizing those \"swipe\" sounds on the ol' strings....?  hopefully i left the poly's simple enough so that it's still easy to tweak for your own purposes!"
