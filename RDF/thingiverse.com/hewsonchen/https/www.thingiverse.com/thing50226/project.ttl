(the clamp nub is ~2 mm too wide for its receptacle in the tom).\r
\r
now you may be asking - this isn't a big deal, the clamp still lets you remember how far down on the post to mount the tom - true, but i felt a little leery about the non-fitting clamp nub wearing away at some non-comformant surface on the tom over time (what with all the vibration of drumming).\r
\r
No worries!  This here is a little adapter that will fit both the memory clamp's nub and the tom's indent, giving both ample seating area to try and avoid undue wear...""" ;
