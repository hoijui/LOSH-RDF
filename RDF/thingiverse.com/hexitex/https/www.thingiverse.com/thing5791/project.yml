function: "The design is based on the Longworth Chuck, it's a great movement and normally used for Woodturning. The chuck's original designer sadly died after showing the design at a club meeting. The late Mr. Longworth of the Hunter Valley Woodturning Club, New South Wales, Australia should be given full credit in this chucks movement.\r\n\r\nI added my take on the design by giving it more mass, taken away the need for wingnuts (making it safer) and generally done as much as possible to make it useful - The nice thing about this design is that it could be made in any material with very little changes to the file. It's a good size chuck maxing out at the makerbot's 10cm build surface wide and 7cm tall.\r\n\r\nYou can design new Jaws to suit your requirement! It is a great tool to have either fitted to a lathe, drill, dremel or just being used to hold items on your bench. \r\n\r\nHad an educational time modelling in Carrara and Hexagon which I used to create this thing. I've been using it for a longtime doing fun stuff and mixing it with photography but never tried anything precise.\r\n\r\nYou are going to need 8 M4-40 cap screws, 8 locking nuts, 1 M7-40(min) hex bolt and nut. \r\n\r\nVideo of the chuck in action http://youtu.be/94ZhwGUWB5I"
