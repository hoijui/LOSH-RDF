function = "This is a replacement for the solidoodle spool mount.  It's square threaded to allow you to tighten the spool.  It uses 17mmx26mm x5mm bearings that fit inside the hat shaped piece.  I used ABEC rated bearings, which make it spin with ease.\r\n\r\nPrint the Spool holder, 2 hats and a wingnut.  put the 17mm bearings in the hats.  Adapt to fit your spool."
