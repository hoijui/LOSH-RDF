function: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_fountain\r\n\r\na gravity powered fountain based on air pressure. You could probably use it as a brainteaser for a high school physics class in the beginning of the school year. I might start a series of water pressure/air pressure demonstrations in the same form factor, then make racks for storing them, etc."
