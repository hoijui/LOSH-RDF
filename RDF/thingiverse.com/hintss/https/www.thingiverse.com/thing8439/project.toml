function = "ikea lackrack hack, now in miniature!\r\n\r\nWith this, I am introducing the server_farm modular rack model system: devices are 19 mm wide, 1.75 mm per U, racks are 20mm wide on the inside, 2 mm per U. Devices are just stacked inside the rack. For screw hole locations (which I won't bother with), refer to the 19 inch rack standard. Tabs on rackmount devices for screw holes should stick out 1 mm to the side. Please tag server_farm compatable stuff server_farm"
