function = "I needed a tray of compartments to put screws in when taking laptops apart and the like so I printed one. I designed it with a noddy little OpenSCAD script so I can make one with long and thin compartments for airbrush needles or whatever.\r\n\r\nI'll probably update this at some point to allow different thickness walls between compartments and for the outer walls and maybe for rounded bottom compartments."
