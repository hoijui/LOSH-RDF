    okh:function """A puzzle for locking one bottle of whatever you want. \r
\r
The model as it is now is designed for bottles with a bottom radius < 40 mm. \r
I think I saw something similare to this here on thingiverse a while ago but wasn't able to locate it when I wanted to print it.\r
\r
I googled "wine bottle puzzle" and worked from pictures I found to make it in openscad. This is the first thing I've made in openscad so the code isn't very nice, maybe I'll get around to fix it, but for now I'll upload it as is.\r
\r
I used a m sized Medieval Barrels by dutchmogul instead of the lockp5 I have here. I had it around from doing another print, it was the right size and looks nice:D If I had any modeling skills (for doing figures and stuff) I would hace sculpted something nice for the top...""" ;
