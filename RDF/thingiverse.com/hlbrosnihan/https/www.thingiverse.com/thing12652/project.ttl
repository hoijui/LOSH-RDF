    okh:function """So these little guys are the creatures of thingiverse. Then come my desire to create a customizable creatures that can become as diverse as its users want.  So this will be an ongoing project of adding more pieces to create all different types critters.  So I am hoping to get lots of people involved in adding parts to their collection or give them accessories and decals. So, give them a lives and stories of their own to tell. \r
\r
Designing to me is very much about sharing and feeding off other people. I just wanted to do something very community based and get myself to model something for myself and others as often as possible I am going to try to add a new piece ever 2 days or so.  This is the first iteration. So fellow members if you want them bigger (there around 2in x 3in x 2in) let me know and let me know about how much detail I can model in.  I was debating one with scales but didn't want to cause hardship when they didn't show up well in a print due to size same goes for hole tolerance.\r
 Also if more joints and moving parts are wanted  I might do a ball joint version. I will need testers for this undertaking..\r
 \r
 I will take piece requests too.  So if you want a crazy tail or something or another body type drop me a line it will keep me creating.  So print the pieces and create your own creature give him or her a name . Make them in different colors. Paint them decal them.  And show them off.  Try making some glow in the dark with a black marker design.  It really up to you. There here for the fun of it.. There a desk toy you can point at and say I made that or an army of little minions to do your making bidding.\r
\r
Anyway that is if for now feel free to ask question. Create a story or world for them. Make an animation out of them physical or digital. It all about open source do what you want with them.  Just put it up so everyone can see and feed off it!""" ;
