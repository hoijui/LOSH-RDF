    okh:function """Figure this would  be a fun thing to try. Normally ocarina are made by hollowing out a clay shape or slip casting to get a hollow form. They take a lot of time to make a one off. Lots of drying time. I figure what better use for a 3d printer. I have no idea on the tuning currently just trying to get it to play first. Improvements will come with input. Anyway have fun let me know how it goes.   

UPDATE: New voicing that works I am currently tuning the different bodies.   

New BODY Loaded! Working on finger hole adjustments. Test and input if you wish. I might move and narrow the voicing after a few tests.
