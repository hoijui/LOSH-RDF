function: The LYMAN FILAMENT EXTRUDER II is a redesign or the original LYMAN FILAMENT EXTRUDER. It features less wood parts and more steel parts, as well as other material changes. The BOM includes quotations of custom parts from emachineshop.com. It is designed for resubmittion to DFC to overcome their objection to the parts being fabricated by me as custom parts.
