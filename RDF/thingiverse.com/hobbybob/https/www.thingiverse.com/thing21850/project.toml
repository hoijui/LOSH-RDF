function = "This is a cone with 608ZZ 22x7mm bearings in them. Print 2 of them and place your spool between them and the spool will turn very easy.\r\nThe cone starts at 70mm and goes to 30mm so you can use it for small spools and large spools.\r\n\r\nThis was my first attempt to create something in Openscad so bear with me."
