function: "Here is a complete product project of endtas design. Alien Light Mini is a LED headlight for bicycles. It has got two 1W leds, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrow beam angle lens.\r\n\r\nThe wide lens is a bit turned towards the ground to light up nearby ahead and the other straight ahead for greater distance lighting.\r\n\r\nVisit the free product design projects website www.endtas.com for circuit schematic, hex file and other details. There are other projects too."
