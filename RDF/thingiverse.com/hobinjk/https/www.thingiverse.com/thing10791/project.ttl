Here's the paragraph about it from my artistic statement:\r
When Nell was a child, many of her toys were made using an MC. To replicate this, I decided that it would be best to print out  a plastic rattle comparable to those favoured by babies. I was able to design this rattle in a way that minimizes the chance of any of the rattling bits being swallowed by the infant while also making sure that the infant would be able to comfortably play with it. No problems were occurred in the design of this object, and its execution was for once flawless.""" ;
