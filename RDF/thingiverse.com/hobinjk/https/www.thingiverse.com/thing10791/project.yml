function: "This is a simple children's rattle that I created as part of a project for English class ( see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10789 ). It is not directly based off of anything mentioned in The Diamond Age that I know off, but you should buy and read that book anyway.\r\nHere's the paragraph about it from my artistic statement:\r\nWhen Nell was a child, many of her toys were made using an MC. To replicate this, I decided that it would be best to print out  a plastic rattle comparable to those favoured by babies. I was able to design this rattle in a way that minimizes the chance of any of the rattling bits being swallowed by the infant while also making sure that the infant would be able to comfortably play with it. No problems were occurred in the design of this object, and its execution was for once flawless."
