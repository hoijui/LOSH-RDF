function: "This is a screwdriver designed as part of my final English project covering the creations of The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson ( see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10789 ). I created this because in the book the protagonist, Nell, prints out a screwdriver to use in an important plot point ( notice how I dodged spoilers there ). On top of its aesthetic value, this screwdriver can also unscrew large, not very tightened, screws.\r\nTo copy-paste my already written artistic statement:\r\nThe third project is a simple screwdriver. A screwdriver was made by Nell for use as an improvised weapon in The Diamond Age. In her case she modified the parameters of the screwdriver to make it as long and as sharp as possible, and sticking to the theme of parametric design, I included this feature. While I did attempt to make the screwdriver as sharp as possible, I ran into the resolution and strength limits of the Cupcake, so the screwdriver that I printed out is not very easy to use as a weapon."
