function: "This is an earlier, printable version of the new MakerBot MK7 filament drive block.  During the development of the MK7, I was hoping we could make the filament drive portion of the design printable.  It worked really well for testing and prototyping, but it was not feasible for us to scale it for production.  Instead, we converted it to injection molding and that is how you have the MK7 we offer today.\r\n\r\nThis filament drive block is a nice, single piece and prints really well on an MK6.  It will print even better on an MK7.  It has dual filament inlet channels, and you can probably mod it to do all sorts of cool things.  I've provided the original solidworks and an STL output for your ease of use.\r\n\r\nA couple things I'm proud of:\r\n\r\n* The 'mouse ears' on the corners help it stick better and remain flat, yet are easy to peel off.\r\n\r\n* The tiny hole slots which cause the holes to be printed as part of the outer shell.  The slot is too small to show up in the final part, and you get a really nice looking bolt hole."
