function = "Catarina and I made this funnel design in www.openscad.org.  This particular funnel is 50mm wide with a 2mm hole.  We made it because we needed to pour some liquids. :)\r\n\r\nNote: the inside overhangs actually killed the print.  we need to adjust the height of the funnel for a better angle.  Cool effect though!\r\n\r\nUpdate: we used the funnel to pour acetone knowing that it would dissolve the threads on the inside.  it completely sealed all the cracks and now its a great little funnel."
