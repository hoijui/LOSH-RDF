function = "This is an attempt at a lasercut peristaltic pump.  These types of pumps are useful for pumping tons of materials.  They can also be made from common materials.  They also are very simple and easy to maintain:  there are very few moving parts, and no gaskets, seals, etc.  Simply pop in some aquarium tubing and you're good to go.\r\n\r\nMore info on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristaltic_pump"
