function: "One of the things that I'm constantly wishing I had more of are coat hooks!  I have way too many hoodies and I hate leaving them on the floor.  So here's my take on a coat hook.  The special feature of this one is that it has 2 hooks for optimum hanging excellence.\r\n\r\nThe design was a mashup of qcad and openscad.  i just couldn't get the curves quite right in openscad and I wanted something with both an angular and curved look.\r\n\r\n\"If we don't all hang together, then surely, we shall all hang separately.\"\r\n\r\n-Benjamin Franklin\r\n\r\n(get it, there are two hooks for hanging...) :X"
