function = "This is the v2.2 of the Stepper Motor Driver.  After quite a few iterations, I've found what I think is the ideal stepper driver chip:  the A3982.  Its SOIC, it does up to 2A/phase, it has current chopping, and does half stepping.  Its also very cheap, and should be easy to solder, even for beginners.\r\n\r\nI'm very excited about this board and I'm looking forward to getting prototypes and testing it."
