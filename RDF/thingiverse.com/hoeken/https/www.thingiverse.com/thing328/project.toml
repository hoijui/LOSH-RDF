function = "This is a minor update of the previous pinch wheel extruder.  I've logged about 40-50 hours on the previous design and have discovered some areas that could use some improvements.  This design should be easier to use.  For example, the smaller gap between the wheel and the Filament Guide will make it less prone to jamming during inital filament loading."
