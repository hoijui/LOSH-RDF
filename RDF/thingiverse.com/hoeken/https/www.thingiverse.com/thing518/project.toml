function = "A second attempt at making a bracelet.  I used a different technique this time:  I created a square, then used the 'Spin' command and extruded it 300 degrees, capped the ends manually, and then scaled it down in the Y axis by about 40% to make it oblong.  Much nicer to wear and a bit prettier.\r\n\r\nAnyone know how i can round the ends?"
