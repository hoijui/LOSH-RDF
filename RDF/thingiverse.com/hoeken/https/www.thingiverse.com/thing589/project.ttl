    okh:function """Today was Fashion Hacking day with Diana Eng at NYC Resistor and I've wanted to make these keyboard pants for a long time.  The basic idea was to take a flexible silicone keyboard and somehow integrate it with some pants (or shorts).  I had they keyboards laying around for a while and I ran down to the Conways to get some jeans for about $8 (Yay fulton mall!)\r
\r
This was inspired by a cool project I saw a long time ago on the hypernets: http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/23/keyboard-infused-pants-make-it-okay-to-grab-your-crotch/""" ;
