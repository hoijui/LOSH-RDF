function: "This is a derivative of the Plastruder MK3 design I've been working on.  The goal is to make the plastruder into a printable design that can be made on a MakerBot.  I also wanted to take on an ambitious project to put the new AOI plugin, MetaCAD through its paces.  Learn about metacad at http://www.metacad.org\r\n\r\nThis extruder design uses 5 printed pieces:  two halves that bolt together for the housing, 2 dinos to put it at the right height for printing, and a simple insulator retainer to keep the PTFE in the right spot.  The rest of the design is mostly the motor, heater barrel assembly, electronics, and a 625 bearing to provide the pinching force.  It has yet to be tested, but ideally it will be simpler to put together, as well as a sturdier design with no squeaks!  I've printed all the parts on my travel bot, and as soon as I get home, I'll be assembling them and testing them out.\r\n\r\nA few design notes:\r\n\r\n* no more layered construction!  that was a hack to make it laser-cuttable.  new design is two halves bolted together.  one half holds the motor + filament, the other half holds the idler wheel.\r\n* idler wheel switched from acrylic + 608 bearing to a single 625 bearing.  smaller, more compact, and nothing but a nearly indestructible bearing to break.  should be quite a bit more consistant\r\n* 4 adjustable screws with captive nuts for setting the pinch wheel tension.  you'll be able to adjust it on the fly, without any sort of dis-assembly.  hopefully the abs will act as a sort of spring as well\r\n\r\na few things i'd like to change yet:\r\n* rotate the captive nut slot on the right-housing to be in-line with print direction for a better finish.\r\n* switch the captive nut / bolt head holes between right and left housings to improve print quality for both  (adjust on right side instead of left side)"
