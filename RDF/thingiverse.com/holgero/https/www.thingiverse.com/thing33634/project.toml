function = "Another LED candle holder, but with OpenSCAD files instead of *.123d files. I made the top of the candle a bit more distorted than the original to give it a 'molten' look.\r\n\r\nThe second holder (holder2.scad) was an experiment with low current LEDs that didn't work out.\r\n\r\nThe third holder (holder3.scad) uses my own flickering LED implementation with a PIC12F508 (https://github.com/holgero/PICFlickerLEDs)."
