function = "A chip with the size of one euro coin, to use as a token for a shopping cart/trolley. Same thing as http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35832 but with an inscription and with openscad files. It uses the MCAD/fonts.scad library for that.\r\n\r\nThe version with the handle works on 50% of the tested shopping carts/trolleys only. (There was on cart that accepted the coin in a tray of some sort, so the attached handle makes it not fit.)"
