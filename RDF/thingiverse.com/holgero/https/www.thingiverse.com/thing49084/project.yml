function: "This is inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34534 , but I did the scad files myself (I wanted to have the stuff parametric...).\r\n\r\nStacking of these does not really work and printing the rail thing in upright positon was a dumb idea in hindsight. But it is good enough to store some LEDs for now, so I am putting it to use and perhaps you'll find it usefull too."
