    okh:function """Just about every day when showering I drop my shampoo  and soap bottles and my toothbrush. I decided to design a simple tray with a holder for the razor and the toothbrush. Holes at the bottom to  allow the water to drain. I yet have to design the holders to attach the basket on the shower. I will update this.\r
\r
I know this is very simple (my very first attempt at designing something), but maybe it is useful for somebody. \r
\r
Along with the stl I publish the scad files. The file cup.scad is the original one, then modified in lowcup.scad. So, if you want to manipulate the scad files, you need both.""" ;
