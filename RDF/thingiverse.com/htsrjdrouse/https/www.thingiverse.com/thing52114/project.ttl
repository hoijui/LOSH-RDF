    okh:function """When I have tried to make repstraps in past I get stuck not having openscads sometimes. \r
\r
I updated this a little to improve the stability of the box and to make it more square (corner_block(), angled_alignments(), and xymotormount_support().  \r
\r
So wanted to make a totally openscad assembly like seeing it all together while building. \r
\r
This is a openscad function library listing parts of repstrap that was put together for doing liquid handling tasks and automated microscope imaging. I like to think its an appropriate design for doing these things but I am sure it will change as things go. \r
\r
The idea behind the openscad library is that you sort of put together the robot virtually.""" ;
