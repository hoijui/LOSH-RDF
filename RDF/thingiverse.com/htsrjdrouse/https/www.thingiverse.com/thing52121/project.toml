function = "I test a lot of microarray slides and agarose coatings always work well (same stuff you use for DNA electrophoresis gels). So like when you cast DNA gels thought it would be cool to print a really small gel caster for surface coating. \r\n\r\nSurprisingly you can make really consistent coatings with this trick and you can use the same set up to attach gaskets to create small wells.\r\n\r\nThis design is for a 16 pad (8 row x 2 column) set up. \r\n\r\nAgarose is cool because you can mix it with different chemistries. \r\n\r\nWhen you finish assay just rehydrate and scrap agarose off\r\n\r\nBut I haven't been able to get such good data using chemiluminescence, but fluorescence works great. \r\n\r\nIf you look at the pre and post washes of protein array you can see how well the agarose retains the spots.\r\n\r\nHere's more data:\r\nhttp://www.htsresources.com/recycleable_surfaces_for_bioassays.php"
