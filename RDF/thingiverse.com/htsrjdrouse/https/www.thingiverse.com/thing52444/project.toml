function = "While reprapping, I have made many microscope techniques, my best solution thus far is to work with analog cameras rather then webcams. So I like Adafruits Analog Camera -  http://www.adafruit.com/products/397. \r\n\r\nThere is also a case for Adafruits TV\r\nhttps://www.adafruit.com/products/910\r\n\r\nBut its pretty lame needs some improvement except you can mount on aluminum extrusion (30mm) and its easy to fix to 20mm.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to make an optical cage system for this using custom focal length lens 1/2\" diameter. \r\n\r\nThe cage system can interface filters or even beam splitters ... potentially it should be straightforward to do now with it anyway. The holes fit the lego black square rods and you have an option to put in a M4 lead screw for zooming. That is about as far as I went with this. \r\n\r\nI just use this for making different working distance lenses. I want to make mounts for Dr.Robotlabs Repstrap Library."
