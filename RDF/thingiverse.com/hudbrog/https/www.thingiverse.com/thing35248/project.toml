function = "Hey everbody,  \n\nWanted to show you a little project I've been working on for some time - http://gcode.ws  \nAs you might've guessed by the topic name - it's a GCode visualizer. And I guess at that point most of you are asking why the hell anyone would write another one.   \n\nWell, mainly because I haven't found a single one that would comply with my humble list of requirements. I mean, most of them allows me to.. well.. visualize GCode file and nothing else. But when I open gcode - it's not for my estetical pleasure, it's to check that there are no problems and to see effects that recent slicer configuration changes done or for any other of several reasons. And the ones I've seen so far doesn't allow me to do that stuff effectively.   \nSo I decided to write one myself.   \n\nFeature list:  \n1) Visualize GCode in 2D, layer by layer   \n1.1) Show retracts and restarts   \n1.2) Show print/move/retract speeds   \n1.3) Display only part of layer/animate squence of layer printing  \n2) Analyze GCode  \n2.1) Print time, amount of plastic used, layer height, etc. for whole file and for single layer  \n2.2) Reference visualized part to GCode file (i.e. select a certain part of 2d visalization, switch to GCode view - it will highlight list of lines responsible for visualized piece)  \n3) Multiplatform, available online (but works offline too), works locally (doesn't upload you gcode anywhere or download anything but application itself)  \n4) 3D visualization (I don't know what for, it's dull and useless.. need to rewrite it to be like in repetier host)  \n5) And yeah, it's slow, memory hungry and only supports modern browsers like chrome and ff of latests versions (maybe safari 6 and ie10, haven't checked)  \n6) Totaly open source so you can use it as you like )  \n-----  \nUpdate 27 Nov 2012:  \nLots of bug fixes, support for DC extruders (M101/M103), order of magnitude improvement in loading time for files with lots of Z movements (like Z-lifts)  \n-----  \nUpdate 28 January 2013  \nLots of bugfixes. Support for upper layer \"shadowing\" and setting extrusion visual thickness.  \n-----  \nUpdate: spring 2013  \nLots of things have changes. You can now use color differentiation based on flow rate, not speed. You can enable \"extrusion width\" emulation to see how well your infill should look. There is a highly experimental feature \"error analysis\" that is available at http://gcode.ws/?new  \nAnd it's migrated to another domain long time ago =)"
