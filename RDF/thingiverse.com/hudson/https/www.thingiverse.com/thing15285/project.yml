function: "The SVG had some artifacts when loaded into inkscape.  There were diagonal lines in oddd places that had to be removed.  Some of the ports still have duplicate cuts, which cause quite a bit of burning.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, my epilog driver uses #FF0000 for vector cuts, so I replaced the edges in the SVG with red thin lines.\r\n\r\nThe numbers are not cut out.  This needs to be fixed."
