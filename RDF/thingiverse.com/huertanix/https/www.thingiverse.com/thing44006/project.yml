function: "A real-life replica of the \"deal with it\" dog meme from the ancient lands of Something Awful's forums (http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deal-with-it). Created for HallowMeme 2012 in NYC. Wear these and become a meme!  \n\nNEW! For anyone that doesn't want to fuss with laser cutters, you can now buy these made-to-order on my Etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/listing/209769159/deal-with-it-glasses?ref=pr_shop"
