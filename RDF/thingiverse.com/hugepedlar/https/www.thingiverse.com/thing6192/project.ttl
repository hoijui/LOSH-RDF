\r
So I designed and printed a plug to stopper the tap.\r
\r
It works better with tape wrapped around the plug for a smoother seal. PTFE tape would probably be best, but kapton tape seems to work OK.\r
\r
I've included the solidworks source file. The dimensions might need altering for differently calibrated makerbots, since it's a tight tolerance.""" ;
