function: "I'm brewing beer, but my fermenter tap is leaky. It's not a big deal, but it'd be nice if it were fully watertight.\r\n\r\nSo I designed and printed a plug to stopper the tap.\r\n\r\nIt works better with tape wrapped around the plug for a smoother seal. PTFE tape would probably be best, but kapton tape seems to work OK.\r\n\r\nI've included the solidworks source file. The dimensions might need altering for differently calibrated makerbots, since it's a tight tolerance."
