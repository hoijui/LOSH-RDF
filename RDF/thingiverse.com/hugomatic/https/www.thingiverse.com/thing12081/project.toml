function = "Back by popular demand (you know who you are)... another Jansen linkage, in a shiny Makerbot friendly edition (some assembly required, your mileage may vary, multiple prints required). \r\n\r\nThis one uses TBuser's pin library v2. I added the file for convenience but its origin is http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10541. \r\n \r\nThe pins break too easily, even when the linkage is big (and that's why its still a thing in progress). I toyed with different pin designs without success. Then I started using acetone... and it got messy so I want to avoid it.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about printing the pins separately using a different orientation (a nice feature of the pin library). Any suggestions?"
