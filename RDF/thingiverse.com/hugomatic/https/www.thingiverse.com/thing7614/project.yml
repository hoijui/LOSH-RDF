function: "Yes... another one!\r\nThis is a follow up to my previous forray in the world of tic-tac-toe:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4254\r\n\r\nWhile the first one was nice, metallic, parametric and all that jazz... it wasn't a big success (0 derivatives and 0 other people's copies). But this one, with 5 x, 4 os and the whole nine pockets, has all the characteristics to actually become a viral thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain: copying is not stealing, but cheating at tic-tac-toe is meh."
