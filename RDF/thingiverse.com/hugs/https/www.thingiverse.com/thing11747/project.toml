function = "Use Bitbeam for your robot's skeleton!  \n\nBitbeam is LEGO Technic-compatible and awesome for building robots and other contraptions.  \n\nEach Bitbeam is an 8mm x 8mm square beam. Holes are 5.0 mm in diameter and 8mm apart from each other -- just like LEGO Technic.  \n\nThe advantage of building your own Bitbeam parts over LEGO is that 1) the materials are cheaper, 2) you can make parts in sizes that Lego doesn't make, and 3) making your pwn parts is fun!"
