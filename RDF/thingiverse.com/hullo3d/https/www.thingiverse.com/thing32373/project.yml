function: Adjusted clip from mpatoulachik for IKEA Ledberg LED strips. This new clip is for positioning 2 IKEA LED DIODER strips on the top of your Ultimaker. LED's are facing down on your object. Now in combo with the original LED clips from mpatoulachik(scaled down 0.88), on the front of the Ultimaker, you can have all 4 Ikea LED DIODER 4-piece lighting strips for a perfect view of your 3d object during printing.
