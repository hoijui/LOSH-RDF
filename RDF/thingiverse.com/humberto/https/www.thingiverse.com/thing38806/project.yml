function: "A variation of the \"ultimaker pla holder for 30mm reels\" with an extended shaft to accomodate 10cm width (4\") reels and a more steep guard to prevent the reels from falling.\r\nSimplified and cleaned the geometry and made a Sketchup version.\r\nNew version (2.1) with dent for 5-6cm spools (helps them stabilize) and wider supports that fir more snugly in the Ultimaker's box. \r\n\r\nAdded a lock pin too.\r\n\r\n(I've left the old version in case someone prefers it, but i'd recommend using at least the pin from the new one)"
