function: "This was suppose to be a halo ring but when I sent it through net fab it closed the ring part of it. If anyone knows how to fix this I would love to learn how so Im uploading the sketch up file.\r\nThe way I ended up printing it is with 100% infill and drilling out the ring.the center of the ring is around 21 mm\r\n I got the halo mask from the sketch up warehouse thanks Grave Heart. \r\nUpdate: Thanks to AMS3000 we now have our ring so make sure to use hurky heretics halo ring"
