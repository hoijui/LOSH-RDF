\r
this is my first attempt at designing something in 3D in SketchUp and I'm rather happy with the way it all turned out, it has been a great learning experience. Skeining returns some errors, the .stl was repaired with netfabb studio and re-saved after being exported from SktechUp.\r
\r
printed on an emaker huxley with a 140x140 bed. could be much bigger on a larger bed but I really like the scale and they seem more like the real thing at this size. \r
\r
after printing a couple of the Snakes: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4743 I kind of got the idea and it just happened. some of the early prototype versions can be seen in the pics.\r
\r
fits nicely into a small zip lock bag to give away to someone who doesn't yet have a 3D printer. \r
\r
designed to allow a reasonable amount of movement in the legs. feel free to stop motion animate. the legs are thin enough to be heated and formed to any shape, or taken off the bed hot and set into shape.""" ;
