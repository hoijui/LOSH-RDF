function = "This is the cage arm connector from a Mini-Plane paramotor. it connects the outside of the cage to the cage support arms on either side. there are 4 of these on a Mini-Plane.\r\n\r\nSo I tried power launching in no wind and the risers squeezed the cage into the prop. I had a spare prop but no plastic fitting so I sketched it up and printed it. works as a backup while replacement parts arrive from somewhere on the internets.\r\n\r\nmy trusty 3D printer had me back in the air the next day :)"
