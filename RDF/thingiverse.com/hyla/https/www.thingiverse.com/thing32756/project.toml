I took http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30088 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5784 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31314 as a starting point. The point was to have a mini hexapod which actually fits the servos I am using (ES-05 by Modelcraft, 2,3 x 1,3 x 2,3 cm, about 6 EURO). Although I kept close to my predecessors most of this was done from scratch. The button is taken from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31314 :)"
