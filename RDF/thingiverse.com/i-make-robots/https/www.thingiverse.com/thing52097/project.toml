Who knew?!  \r\n\r\nThey were first researched in 1938.  Curtis Boirum built one that got on Hackaday.  Now I bring you the plans for a model that you can print and build yourself.  Use one to make an awesome RC car.  Use two to make an RC car that can move in any direction.  I'm using one to make a line-following robot.  It has about 15 degrees of movement on either axis.  \r\n\r\nIf you use one of my designs, please let me know!  I'd love to see what you make with it and share with others who are interested.\r\n\r\nSupport me through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/imakerobots\r\n\r\nOr make a one time donation: https://www.paypal.me/imakerobots\r\nEvery like, share, and subscribe helps!\r\n\r\nBlog: http://marginallyclever.com/\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/imakerobots\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MarginallyClever\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/aggrav8d\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q5TZFmB"
