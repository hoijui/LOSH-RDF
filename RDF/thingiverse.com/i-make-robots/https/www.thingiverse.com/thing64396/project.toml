I'd love to see what you make with it and share with others who are interested.\r\n\r\nSupport me through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/imakerobots\r\n\r\nOr make a one time donation: https://www.paypal.me/imakerobots\r\nEvery like, share, and subscribe helps!\r\n\r\nBlog: http://marginallyclever.com/\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/imakerobots\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MarginallyClever\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/aggrav8d\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q5TZFmB"
