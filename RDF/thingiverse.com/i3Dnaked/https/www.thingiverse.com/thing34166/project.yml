function: "I was frustrated yesterday that there is not a desktop dock / stand  and had 10 minutes to spare. \r\nAll parts are Apple made parts save for the super glue and 3M tape. \r\nI took a regular iPad dock, set the ban saw to its width. Cut a piece of acrylic to that width. The acrylic was from some old iPod packaging, masked that piece for a notch out for the 30 pin to Lightning connector, cut that out with a Dremel tool, adhered the adapter with 3M tape, then ran a bead of Loctite Super Glue Gel control along the top edge of the white dock. BINGO! iPad Mini Dock / Charging stand. Problem solved."
