function = "I loved making this violin.  It was a lot of fun to make.  I sometimes wish I had four hands so I made a few changes to help in the assembly process.  I added cut outs to the top and bottom and tabs to the sides.  It gave me freedom to glue the sides to the bottom and leave the top unglued until I have everything just where I wanted it."
