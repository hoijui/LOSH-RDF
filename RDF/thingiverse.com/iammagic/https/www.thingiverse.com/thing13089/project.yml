function: "I am making a chamber for my RepRap and wanted to put it on Rubber Feet.  They were expensive at the hardware store ($6.00 each) so I purchased a pack of 4 rubber tips and made some inserts to go in them.  Total price $2.19 for the feet and 49 cents for the carriage bolts and nuts.\r\n\r\nParts List\r\n\r\n4 1/4 in. Carriage Bolts of the length you need\r\n4 Nuts to fit\r\n4 Slip on rubber feet like the ones pictured"
