function = "A touchpoint cap for a Fujitsu T2010 (or similar) laptop/convertible.  \n\n\n\nMy (circa 2007) Fujitsu T2010 has served me well, and continues to do so; however it suffers by having a \"touchpoint\" mouse (one of the joystick style ones).  I managed to lose the replacement caps, and the one I had on there eventually disintegrated after a couple of years of very heavy use.  \n\n\n\nAfter searching high and low for several years, I now have a 3d printer and decided to make my own."
