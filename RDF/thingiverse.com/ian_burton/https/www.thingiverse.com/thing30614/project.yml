function: "I purchased a couple of sets of \"LED Throwies Pack\" from Zazz (https://www.zazz.com.au/daily/thingy/6047) a while ago - primarily for the cheap CR2032 \"button\" batteries.  \r\nEverything arrived, but I found that the batteries were packed in a tape-type plastic and once I took one out I had batteries everywhere.\r\nTo keep the batteries separated (and make it easier to select \"just one\") I made this holder.\r\n\r\nIt holds 40 (4x10) batteries.  You can print 1 (open top) or 2 (for a full case)."
