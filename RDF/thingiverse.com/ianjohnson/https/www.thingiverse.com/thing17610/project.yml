function: "A coffee scoop/tamper made from passion flower vines.\r\n\r\nWhen my scoop/tamper broke, I decided to make a new one, but do something a little more interesting than a plain handle with a bowl at one end and a disk at the other.  I like Hawaiian coffee, and have a couple other Hawaiian things around the espresso machine, so I thought I might try something tropical.  \r\n\r\nI got some passion flower vines from the backyard and twisted them together to make a handle, and glued some of the leaves on the outside of the scoop.  I coiled some vines in a circle and pinned them to cardboard for the tamper.  Then I photographed these 3 elements and uploaded them to 123D Catch. I used macro and filled the frame as much as possible when taking the pictures, even if it meant I couldn't fit the whole object in a single frame.  I put some flour on the inside of the scoop to give it some texture.  This gave Catch a lot of detail to work with, and it did a great job. \r\n\r\nI scaled, edited, and mashed the parts together to make the finished scoop and ran it through cloud.netfabb.com a bunch to clean it up."
