    okh:function """Coming soon to Kickstarter!  A revolution in pest control, with revolutionary implications for a paradigm shift in human health the world over, especially in impoverished third world countries.  Introducing iSwattr, a radical new design that brings the latest smart phone technology to bear on the killing of menaces such as disease carrying flies, icky cockroaches, and scary spiders.\r
\r
Simply insert the phone into the paddle (constructed from space age extruded plastics) and run the iSwattr app (still in development).  iSwattr uses the iPhoneâ€™s high resolution camera to target flies and track them, making use of highly scientific proprietary probabilistic predictive algorithms to anticipate the flyâ€™s every move and alert you to the ideal moment to strike!\r
\r
Again using the camera, the app can detect whether you scored a hit or a miss, and in the case of a hit, will display an image of the flyâ€™s last moment for you to post on your virtual trophy wall.  Thanks to the wonder of cloud technology, you can compare your own performance to iSwattrs around the world.  See how your insect murdering skills compare, and share tips and techniques on the iSwattr forums and leader boards.  Twitter and Facebook integration automatically posts or tweets images of your kills, and personal best milestones.   Issue challenges to others, such as a race to see who can kill the most spiders in the next 24 hours. \r
\r
Social media and gaming integration are what make the iSwattr truly revolutionary for it incentivizes people the world over to seek out and destroy pests that are health hazards like flies and cockroaches, or just plain evil, like spiders, and not merely kill the ones they encounter by chance.\r
\r
The iSwatter is also a charging dock, so it will be powered up and ready to go at a momentâ€™s notice.  \r
\r
Coming in iSwatter 2.0 â€“ electrified paddle and integrated speakers!\r
\r
Enthusiastic use of the iSwattr may cause the back of the iPhone to shatter.  However the knife sharp shards of glass sticking out will enhance the iSwattrâ€™s ability to dispatch even the largest threats you may encounter, like Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches or Tarantulas.\r
