function: "Coming soon to Kickstarter!  A revolution in pest control, with revolutionary implications for a paradigm shift in human health the world over, especially in impoverished third world countries.  Introducing iSwattr, a radical new design that brings the latest smart phone technology to bear on the killing of menaces such as disease carrying flies, icky cockroaches, and scary spiders.\r\n\r\nSimply insert the phone into the paddle (constructed from space age extruded plastics) and run the iSwattr app (still in development).  iSwattr uses the iPhone\xE2\u20AC\u2122s high resolution camera to target flies and track them, making use of highly scientific proprietary probabilistic predictive algorithms to anticipate the fly\xE2\u20AC\u2122s every move and alert you to the ideal moment to strike!\r\n\r\nAgain using the camera, the app can detect whether you scored a hit or a miss, and in the case of a hit, will display an image of the fly\xE2\u20AC\u2122s last moment for you to post on your virtual trophy wall.  Thanks to the wonder of cloud technology, you can compare your own performance to iSwattrs around the world.  See how your insect murdering skills compare, and share tips and techniques on the iSwattr forums and leader boards.  Twitter and Facebook integration automatically posts or tweets images of your kills, and personal best milestones.   Issue challenges to others, such as a race to see who can kill the most spiders in the next 24 hours. \r\n\r\nSocial media and gaming integration are what make the iSwattr truly revolutionary for it incentivizes people the world over to seek out and destroy pests that are health hazards like flies and cockroaches, or just plain evil, like spiders, and not merely kill the ones they encounter by chance.\r\n\r\nThe iSwatter is also a charging dock, so it will be powered up and ready to go at a moment\xE2\u20AC\u2122s notice.  \r\n\r\nComing in iSwatter 2.0 \xE2\u20AC\u201C electrified paddle and integrated speakers!\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic use of the iSwattr may cause the back of the iPhone to shatter.  However the knife sharp shards of glass sticking out will enhance the iSwattr\xE2\u20AC\u2122s ability to dispatch even the largest threats you may encounter, like Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches or Tarantulas.\r\n\r\nSee the iSwatter in action here- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIlKRIfQYH8\r\n\r\nThe Kickstarter contributions / rewards-\r\n$1-\tThe warm fuzzy feeling that comes from the knowledge that you have done something to improve the world.\r\n\r\n$100\tAn iSwattr of your very own.\r\n\r\n$1000\tAn iSwatter and an iPhone to provide everything you need to wipe insects and spiders off the face of this earth.\r\n\r\n$10,000 An iSwatter,and iPhone, and the very first fly killed by an iSwatter, pinned and mounted in a shadowbox signed by the iSwatter founders.\r\n\r\nFunding Goal- $830,827"
