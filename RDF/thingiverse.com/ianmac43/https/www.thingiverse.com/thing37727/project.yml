function: "Finger Splint:\r\n\r\nWith the supervision of Dr. R. Siderits, I have designed a prototype \"finger splint\".  This project offers a parametric file describing this object.  It is intended to demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of \xE2\u20AC\u01533-D printed medical devices\xE2\u20AC\x9D, and to facilitate Thingiverse design derivatives of the parametric file. \r\n\r\nThe appropriately stringent oversight for design, production, manufacture, distribution and use of the medical devices is not addressed in this project.  This project is for research use only.\r\n\r\nFinger splints can come in many shapes and sizes. A finger splint immobilizes a finger or joint after an injury.  Countries with restricted economies and open boarders may use this type of \xE2\u20AC\u0153Field Splint\xE2\u20AC\x9D as a convenient and inexpensive temporary stabilization device.  This file describes a \xE2\u20AC\u0153Field Splint\xE2\u20AC\x9D that can be scaled on any axis and printed using ABS Plastic.   Depending on the platform up to 30-40 splints can be printed in one \xE2\u20AC\u0153Run\xE2\u20AC\x9D.  Each of these can be scaled independently.  \r\n\r\nThis approach may offer an opportunity to provide standardized devices for clinics, remote hospitals as well as field first aid posts.  The cost for each splint would be less than 2 cents worth of ABS plastic.  A single small 3D printer could conceivably print thousands per year.  Once the file is downloaded the splint can be scaled on any axis to fit any finger properly. This research project would be used for emergency field \xE2\u20AC\u0153dressing\xE2\u20AC\x9D and stabilization. Any medical dressing should be used only under the supervision of a qualified medical practitioner.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the Design Process \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJCgFzIUApA\r\n\r\nThe finger bones used in the bones.jpg have been used from \r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15342\r\n\r\nThis project is supervised by \r\nDr. R.  Siderits, under the Experimental pathology division - Mentored research program -\"Device challenge\".  \r\n\r\n3/19/13\r\n\r\nI have recently been in my local Science and Engineering Fair for this project. My title was 3D Printable Medical Devices as Used to Create a Field Splint at an Affordable Price. At the fair I won:\r\n\r\n1st place for Science and Engineering Fairs United States Army Award form the United States Army Awards Program\r\n\r\n2nd place in the Senior Division in the field of Engineering Materials and Bioengineering.\r\n\r\nCertification of Achievement from United States Department of the Army, Army Awards Program.\r\n\r\nCertificate of Achievement from United States Department of the Air Force Science Fair Program."
