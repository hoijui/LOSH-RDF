function = "A model based on Perry the Platypus from the Disney's Phineas & Ferb series.\r\n\r\nI scaled the model down to approximately 98mm x 36mm x 24mm (LWH) when assembled. Also added 5mm x 6.5mm pegs to the legs, with a corresponding 5.2mm hole in the body section. If you know how to widen the holes, I recommend you widen them to about 5.5mm so that you won't need to drill it out."
