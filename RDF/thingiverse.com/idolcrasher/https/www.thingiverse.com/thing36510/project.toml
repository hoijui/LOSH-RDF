function = "Stick it to the man (figuratively only please!) with this open source, fun and completely functional butterfly-comb!\r\n\r\nAll the flash and guile of a butterfly knife, but your fingers get to stay attached to your hands!\r\n\r\nBased off of Techno264's excellent design, this blade has wider, curved teeth which print easily and won't break off.  Also, the comb now has a blood groove, and an angled tanto point for an aggressive look :)\r\n\r\nThe butterfly-comb is completely harmless, fun to play with, and a you can really comb your hair with it!\r\n\r\nIt prints in minutes, so you can use it to impress friends when giving a demo of your 3D printer :)\r\n\r\nI will be posting a video about the comb on my site shortly: www.fabberforge.com\r\n\r\nUpdate 12/2/2012 1700:  Added experimental untested comb with pointy teeth :) \r\n\r\nUpdate 12/2/2012 1800:  Added a second experimental pointy tooth comb :)\r\n\r\nUpdate 12/5/2012 1828:  V2 Comb Blade uploaded.  It is 1mm thicker (more sturdy) and has pointed curved teeth."
