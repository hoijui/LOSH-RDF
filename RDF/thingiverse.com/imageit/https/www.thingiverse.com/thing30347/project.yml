function: "Had a lot of fun playing with ReconstructMe, it's a great piece of software. This is a scan of my head that was cleaned up with the following software. Blender, MeshLab, Netfab, Meshmixer07.   \n\nThe 2 photos in black plastic were smoothed out by evaporating 2 spoons of acetone in a jar on my hot plate at 90 Degrees Celsius for 10 minutes. The method involves setting the heatbed to 110 for 10 minutes then drop the temperature to 90, add the acetone to the bottom of the jar and then lowering the object to be smoothed into the jar on a raised platform making sure no part of the printed object touches any acetone at any time since the evaporation is all that's needed to make the plastic smooth.  \n\nLeave the printed part in for 10 minutes or until done to your liking.  \n\nNote: Acetone is flammable, do not expose to any flame while working with it."
