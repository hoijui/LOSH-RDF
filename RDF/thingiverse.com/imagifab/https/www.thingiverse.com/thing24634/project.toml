function = "This is a simple collar I designed to protect drip irrigation hoses (and saplings) from the evil string trimmer. Since it was designed specifically for drip irrigation hose, there is a \"tunnel\" on one side to allow for underground hose installation. The slot on the back side easily stretches to allow for 1/2\" diameter shepherd's hook posts."
