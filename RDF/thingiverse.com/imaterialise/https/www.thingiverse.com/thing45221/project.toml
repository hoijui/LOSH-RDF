function = "The Nokia Lumia 820 has a clip-on interchangeable back which can be downloaded on the Nokia developer site. It can then be 3D printed on your printer or by a service such as ours. But it turned out to be not functional. That's why we've optimized the design for 3D printing to make it work for laser sintering, stereolithography, polyjet and fused deposition modeling (cf. Makerbot)."
