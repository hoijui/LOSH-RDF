function: "I created this cell phone mount to hold my phone (Nexus S) while I use it as a GPS or a speaker phone.\r\n\r\nIt clips to one of the bars on the vent, if the clip doesn't fit, the sketchup model is attached so you can make the modifications. The arms slide out so you can put your cellphone in, then they close and hold the cellphone in place. All the ports are accessible, so you can charge the phone while you drive or plug the headphone jack into your car speakers.\r\n\r\nIt works well on my Nexus S and my wife's Blackberry.\r\n\r\nEnjoy..."
