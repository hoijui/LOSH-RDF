function = "This is a very basic tool for testing hole sizes for various screws.\r\n\r\nEvery printer is slightly different in its specifications and capabilities. I wanted to make sure that the screws I'm using will work effectively on the various projects I'm developing, so I made this tool to ensure the screws will fit correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is basically just a set of increasingly larger holes, from 2.0 mm through 6.2 mm, in 0.2 mm increments. I have included a reference image that will enable you to quickly identify the size that fits best."
