function = "I recently built the Ninja CNC kit from CNCSNAP.com. They recommend you use a fan to cool the board but they don't include a fan or an enclosure. So it bought a \"thunderblade\" 80mm blue led fan from radio shack and designed this enclosure for the board. I didn't feel like designing fastener attachments for the top-base connections so I just heat welded them together.\r\nFeel free to modify the design to use a different fan if you like.\r\nCheck out my other Upgrades for this kit.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16749"
