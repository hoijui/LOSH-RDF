function: These are my attempts at making a Boatswain Whistle. The first one is made to look pretty but it is difficult to get it to make any noise, as I printed it. It is also not meant to be printed without support. The second file is made to make more noise and be printable w/o support. I have not been able to print the second one. Both have a small link to which a chain can be attached.
