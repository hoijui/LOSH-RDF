function: Don't have enough t-nuts in your extrusion? Ooops! Well grab a pair of my nut clamps and clamp your nuts to that stiff aluminum. My nutty clamps will clamp your nuts so firmly that wobble and shake will be a thing of the past. Just jam your nuts in the slots and screw down the clamps until the desired pressure is achieved. The parametric file accommodates nuts of many shapes and sizes, so regardless of how big or small your nuts are, you'll be guaranteed to get them in a bind.
