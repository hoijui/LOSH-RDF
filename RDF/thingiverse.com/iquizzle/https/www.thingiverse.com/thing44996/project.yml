function: There are many ways to hold an LMxUU bearing. This is mostly a conceptual presentation of one that I (surprisingly) haven't seen yet. Simply print this part and clip retaining rings into the slots on the LMxUU bearing. No more breaking clamps or bearing slippage. Ever wonder what those slots on the LMxUU bearing were for? Now you know!
