function: "The local supermarket doesn't sell the paper cases used for making cup cakes and other similar baked goods. They do sell baking parchment though, so I whipped this up in Openscad.\r\n\r\nI designed it to be printed, but as I do not yet have a 3d printer this is still untested. \r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who commented on my things! A big thank you to MakeALot who pointed out that something wasn't right with the diagrams. Details in the updated code."
