function: "I love my workmate, it's one of the most useful tools I own. The only thing is, it only comes with 4  of the little plastic blocks that plug in to the holes on top.\r\n\r\nThe block that comes with is great, but I think that there are other things that would also be usefull. I've included a couple of my own ideas here. The peg used to connect to the bench is included as a separate file if you feel like making your own designs."
