function: "These are really useful, can't have enough of them in my book. I made it because I didn't see one in thingiverse already.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get the hang of Openscad and the shape was just difficult enough to make it interesting to me. \r\n\r\nThe code is not the most beautiful and there are some areas where it could do with cleaning up.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this will print as I don't have a printer yet."
