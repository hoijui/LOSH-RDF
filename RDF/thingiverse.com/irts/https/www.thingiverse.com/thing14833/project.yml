function: "Just what thingiverse needs, another box...\r\n\r\nI see that fdavies created http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:635 a box with hinged lid 3 years ago. \r\n\r\nI drew this one in OpenScad and it's parametric so you can scale it to the size you prefer.  \r\n\r\nI was going to use minkowski() to do the rounding on the top of the box, but my machine doesn't have the power to render it that way, so there's some code in there that isn't used and a lot of the files are ones I used while I was working and then discarded. \r\n\r\nI haven't printed this yet, but I'm hoping to soon."
