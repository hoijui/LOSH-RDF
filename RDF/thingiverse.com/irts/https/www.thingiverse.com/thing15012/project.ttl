I thought it would be nice to hollow her out and make a shooter glass. It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. \r
\r
First I tried to subtract a scaled version from the original in openscad. Didn't work, no matter what I did there were always holes. Not wanting to give up I simply started subtracting parts of the scaled version before subtracting from the original. The results were better, but I still couldn't get a waterproof shell. Then I ran across this post by Christopher Lowe on Shapeways forum :http://www.shapeways.com/forum/index.php?t=msg&th=7000|\r

simple...\r
import in your model...\r
\r
if it is water tight i suggest picking a poly and deleting it... making it un-watertight... something big enough though that it follows the rules about drainage holes...\r
\r
assuming that you are using the new 2.6 there should be a panel on the right of the screen. in the headder hit the button that looks like a wrench- this is the modifier tab.\r
\r
in the modifier pull down select add modifier and then select solidify... there are several options in there but there are a few things that you should remember...\r
\r
you can type in the exact thickness that you want but you must make sure that the part that you are using has a scale of 1... this is easily certified by object- apply- scale.\r
\r
also to be able to put in a specific distance the model needs to be set to metric or imperial... don't worry you can go back and forth with no problem...\r
\r
finally blender has an stl exporter that works just fine... you don't even have to apply the modifier before exit...\r
\r
--That worked a lot better. You can see some of the things I tried in the zip file. \r
\r
tl;dr - The shape you need to subtract from a solid to make it hollow with even wall thickness is not always the same shape scaled down.""" ;
