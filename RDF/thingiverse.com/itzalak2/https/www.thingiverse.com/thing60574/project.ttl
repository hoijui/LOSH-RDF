    okh:function """As many friends here, I was suffering overheating problems in the rep2 extruder mod downloaded from thingiverse. This heat causes a deformation in the extruder pieces and the system starts to lose strength and print worse with time. \r
\r
Bored about this problem (I replinted 4 or 5 extruder mods) I decided to design an easy and cheap way to replace the extruder with same printing results as a new extruder mod but with no deformations due overheating.\r
\r
I bought a plunger from farnell:\r
http://es.farnell.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?SKU=1378331\r
and I used an spring from vanel I had at home:\r
https://www.vanel.com/spring-details.php?lang=spanish&ref=C.081.125.0100.I&sessionid=87222222128513e06795f3a9966294491120580088288434\r
\r
I redesigned the extruder system to fit the spring and used the ball (only the ball) from the plunger bought in farnell.\r
\r
As the spring was longer than needed I had to increase 2mm the size of the "casing" but as there was space it was no problem.\r
\r
It works very weel and the heat didn't cause any deformation that causes to start to print worse. \r
\r
Hope you will enjoy!""" ;
