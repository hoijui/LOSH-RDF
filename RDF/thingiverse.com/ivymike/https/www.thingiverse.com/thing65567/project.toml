function = "Right-hand steering knuckle from steering linkage assembly p/n 74110-9239 (Power Wheels Ninja Quad).  This is not an identical replacement but has been thickened/enlarged somewhat for strength.  See installation photo for comparison of old/new.  \nIn the end I thought this one was also not strong enough, and I made a new version which is much more robust.  Please see the \"remixes\" of this part for details."
