function: "This is a redesign of my iPhone 4 wall mount dock in opens cad.  I needed to make it fit a slightly thicker case and didn't want to boot into windows to mess with the old Alibre file...\r\n\r\nI also used my dovetail modules ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10269 ) to make versions that have dovetails so that they can join together for if you have more than one iPhone 4 in your family.\r\n\r\nThe dovetails aren't terribly sturdy since they are rather small but I mostly wanted them to stop the docks from pivoting without having to add another screw to them."
