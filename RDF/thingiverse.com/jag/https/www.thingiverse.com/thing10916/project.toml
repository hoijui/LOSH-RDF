function = "For some reason I didn't want to stick the LEDs onto my Z stage with sticky back.  I wanted them to be easily removable for repair or replacement.  So, rather than just stick them to some material that I attached to the z stage, I made this thing.\r\n\r\nThere are dovetailed slots that you can slide the LEDs into and you don't have to use the adhesive at all (it would probably be trick to use it if you wanted to).\r\n\r\nThere are slots on either side that go under the extruder mount bolts and one in the back if you want to add another nut and bolt."
