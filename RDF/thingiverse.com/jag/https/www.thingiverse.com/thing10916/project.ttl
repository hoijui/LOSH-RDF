\r
There are dovetailed slots that you can slide the LEDs into and you don't have to use the adhesive at all (it would probably be trick to use it if you wanted to).\r
\r
There are slots on either side that go under the extruder mount bolts and one in the back if you want to add another nut and bolt.""" ;
