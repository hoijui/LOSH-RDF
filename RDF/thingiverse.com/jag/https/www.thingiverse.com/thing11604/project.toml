function = "I'm not a huge fan of the acrylic motor mounts that come with the arducopter kit.  I already cracked one of them landing my copter in a tree.\r\n\r\nThis is a one piece replacement that moves the motor inboard by 16mm so that two of the motor screws go through the arm so it's not dangling off the end of the arm.\r\n\r\nThey weigh a tiny bit less than the acrylic ones (8g w/ 75% fill vs 10g)\r\n\r\nI haven't flown these yet.  I'm still printing them out.\r\n\r\nIt should be pretty easy to modify this for different motors (I already have some constants in there for some turnigy motors I have but I haven't tested them out yet)."
