Here are some simple little clips I made that slide onto the plywood and will hold a piece of plexi or lexan.\r
You can probably get away with using 3 per side but I ended up using 6.\r
\r
The scad file is easily modified to adjust the thickness of the wood or the plastic.\r
\r
It's currently set up for a plastic panel that is about 2.5mm thick (3/32" maybe?)\r
It's just what I had laying around in my basement.""" ;
