function: "With the colder weather here, I needed a way to attach some lexan to my makerbot to keep some of the heat in.\r\nHere are some simple little clips I made that slide onto the plywood and will hold a piece of plexi or lexan.\r\nYou can probably get away with using 3 per side but I ended up using 6.\r\n\r\nThe scad file is easily modified to adjust the thickness of the wood or the plastic.\r\n\r\nIt's currently set up for a plastic panel that is about 2.5mm thick (3/32\" maybe?)\r\nIt's just what I had laying around in my basement."
