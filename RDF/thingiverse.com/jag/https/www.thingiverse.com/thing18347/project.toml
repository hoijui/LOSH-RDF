function = "This is an attachment for a dremel or similar tool that makes it easy to grind tungsten electrodes for TIG welding.  \r\n\r\nIt has holes for 1/16\", 3/32\" and 1/8\" electrodes at 4 different angles.\r\n\r\nIt uses a diamond disc that I got at harbor freight (I think)\r\n\r\nThanks to Lenbok ( http://www.thingiverse.com/Lenbok ) for the original design.  I'd been meaning to design this for a while but his design did most of the work for me."
