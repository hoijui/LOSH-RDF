    okh:function """This is my attempt to make a printable T-Handle to slip a plain old hex wrench into to make it into a T handled wrench.  It is currently completely untested.  I haven't gotten my printer yet (or assembled it) so I haven't been able to try it out.  There are variables for the size of the wrench, the length of the T, the diameter of the T handle, the size of the cutout for the short part of the wrench, the length of a sleeve around the wrench (making up the vertical part of the T) and the amount of overhang where the wrench slips in to hopefully make it snap in place.\r
I have now uploaded a second version that has a cover that slides in from the side to hopefully retain the wrench.""" ;
