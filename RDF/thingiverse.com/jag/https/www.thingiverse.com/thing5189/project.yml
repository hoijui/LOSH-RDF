function: "This is my attempt to make a printable T-Handle to slip a plain old hex wrench into to make it into a T handled wrench.  It is currently completely untested.  I haven't gotten my printer yet (or assembled it) so I haven't been able to try it out.  There are variables for the size of the wrench, the length of the T, the diameter of the T handle, the size of the cutout for the short part of the wrench, the length of a sleeve around the wrench (making up the vertical part of the T) and the amount of overhang where the wrench slips in to hopefully make it snap in place.\r\nI have now uploaded a second version that has a cover that slides in from the side to hopefully retain the wrench."
