function: A while ago, the lever on my ice cream maker broke.  Unfortunately, it was not a part that was available anymore.  So, I designed a replacement and machined it out of aluminum.  The part is mostly right.  I think I had to file out the hole a bit to get the flats of the shaft to fit through.  The angle is also off by a tiny bit but it works great!
