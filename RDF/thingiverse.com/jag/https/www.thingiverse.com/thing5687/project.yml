function: "A holder for some pads of paper and pens/pencils.\r\nDesigned in openscad so it is easily changed.  There are variables at the top of the file defining the basic parameters (height, depth width of the two sections and wall thickness).\r\n\r\nI've also included a model that is perforated (you can adjust the perforations in the openscad file)"
