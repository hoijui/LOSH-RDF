function = "I've been using cord reels purchased from home depot for holding my filament.  I realized they were sized pretty nicely to fit on top of the machine but unfortunately the extruder hits them when it's all the way up and I was also worried it would fall off after a while.\r\nSo, these are clips that attach to the top of your makerbot (they are designed for my Thing-O-Matic, not sure if they'll work on the cupcake).  You can then snap the cord reel into them and they hold it pretty securely and raise it up about 50mm."
