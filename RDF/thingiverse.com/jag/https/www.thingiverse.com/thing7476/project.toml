function = "This is a dock that accepts a USB sync cable and mounts to the wall (or whatever).  I've only tested the fit with the cable that I have on hand which may not be a genuine apple cable.\r\nThere is a bit of a taper in the spot for the connector so that it sticks in there a bit and hopefully won't pull out when you remove the phone.\r\nThis is designed to fit my phone in it's case.  It could be pretty easily adapted to different cases (or no case at all)"
