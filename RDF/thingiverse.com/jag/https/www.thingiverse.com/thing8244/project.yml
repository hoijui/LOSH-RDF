function: "Because thingiverse can never have enough bottle openers...\r\n\r\nHere's an openscad wall mountable penny bottle opener.\r\n\r\nThe scad file is parametric though you'll have to play around to see what works.  It's not commented at all and rather poorly written...\r\n\r\nThere is now a first attempt at a version with a tongue and eyes.  I haven't printed it though.  You can turn it off and on with a boolean in the scad file."
