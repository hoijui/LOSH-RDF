function = "This is a variation on http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8023 which can hold the PTFE tube (or tubes!) from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9604. On my ToM, the PTFE tubing sagged down after leaving the stacked guide to such an extent that it was deforming the plastic as it entered the extruder. This guide supports the tubes by the extruder and ensures that the openings remain perpendicular to the hole in the top. I made it so it could clip onto the side, since I hate having to unscrew those little squares every time I modify the printer...\r\n\r\nThe holes sizes were adjusted using http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12846 to account for the thermal variations in my printer - it should work for others as well. I reduced the amount of plastic as much as I thought possible through lightening holes; the whole print take 1 hour 20 minutes for me at 0.25mm layer height and 20mm/s feed rate.\r\n\r\nSource files from pro/e are included in .zip package."
