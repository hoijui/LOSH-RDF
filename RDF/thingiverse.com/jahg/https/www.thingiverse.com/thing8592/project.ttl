    okh:function """This was a quick cartoony rocket I modeled as a demonstration piece. The rocket contains everything you'd want in a classic sci-fi cartoon: three fins, a pleasingly curved shape and a neat cockpit.\r
I printed this on a ToM with the ABP using a raft - the fins didn't turn out great, but I can't tell if that's because of the resolution of the stl, the size of the model or the parameters that I was using. Hopefully more people will print this and let me know how it turns out!\r
It's a reasonably quick print, ~30 minutes including the time to heat up the platform etc.""" ;
