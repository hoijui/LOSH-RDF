function = "I have changed the design by making a reprappable base for the spool. This way you don't have to mess around with wood for the base, just print it!\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n I have added a spool_clip part file, also parametric and designed in OpenSCAD. Just print 6 of these little guys and they will clip right into the slots on the filament spindle parts to enhance the length. No other pieces are needed."
