function = "It is always embarrassing for someone to knock on the bathroom door while you are using it, so I created this sign for my work's bathroom. I had a paper one that I made years ago and had to replace it many times. I figured since I just got my Makerbot, that I would try my hand at making something useful. The sign is about 80mm x 25mm.\r\n\r\nYou just flip the two sided sign to either OCCUPIED or VACANT when you enter or leave the bathroom. I printed this one in two colors using permanent markers and the holder found on Thingiverse."
