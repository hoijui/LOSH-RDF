function: Just something I threw together for my Rostock printer to help keep any vibrations of the rods down. I am using carbon fiber rods that are about 5.5mm diameter. I picked up the springs at local hardware store. The printed pieces are about 21mm center to center so that leaves about a 33mm gap (with about 75mm distance between rods) for the spring. The springs I used were not too strong and about 20mm long.
