function = "I take my printer places and made these to allow me to lay the printer face down and not put any weight on the carriages. They fit on MDF platforms. I put one near each column on the front and secured them with a dab of silicone or caulking. I have handles on the back of my printer and just pick it up and lay it down in my trunk."
