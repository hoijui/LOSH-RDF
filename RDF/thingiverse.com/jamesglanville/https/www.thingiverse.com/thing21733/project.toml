function = "A modular case for the raspberry pi, print a top and bottom to suit whatever you want to mount your pi to, and whatever top you want so you can cover/see your pi.\r\n\r\nThe four sides join to form hinges - this makes it easy to bolt them all into a line of four, fold it around the pi, then fix. I experimented with supporting the pcb from above and below, but this design causes the pcb to flex far far less."
