function: "***NOTE***\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo, I see people \"Liking\" this and adding it to their collections, so I have been meaning to throw this in here for a long time, but finally got around to it today.  I modeled this  7 years ago when I was an engineering student, and after much experience with linear motion mechanisms, I just have to say, this really is not a very good design at all and I would advise against using it.  I am tempted to delete it, but have decided to leave it up.  \r\n\r\nAs I look at it now, it is really a poor design, starting with the fact that you are using a \"flat\" surface (outside edge of 608 bearing) to traverse a curved cylindrical surface (linear rod).  Anyway, I just wanted to throw that thought out there for whatever it is worth.  Thanks.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nLinear Bearing designed for 608 (skate) bearings and M8 or 5/16\" bolts.  (File is in Inventor 2011 format, as well as STL).  Designed for a 1/2\" rod.  Two of the six bearing holes are slightly oval to allow for adjustment via the set screws.\r\n\r\nBased on Dave Kush's Design (http://www.buildyouridea.com/cnc/hblb/hblb.html)\r\n\r\nUpdate #1 (06-OCT-2010):\r\n  - Fixed scaling issue in STL file.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate #2 (06-OCT-2010):\r\n  - Added mounting holes.\r\n  - Added additional STL file without mounting holes.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate #3 (06-OCT-2010):\r\n  - Modified one set of bearing holes to be slighting oval.\r\n  - Added set screws to allow for bearing adjustment."
