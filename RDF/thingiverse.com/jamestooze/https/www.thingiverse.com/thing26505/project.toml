function = "On long cycle rides I see loads of stuff worthy of a photo but with the camera often buried in my backpack I push on making sure to keep up a good pace. So I made this mount to clip it under the frame, so that it is hand for the chance moments and pics on the fly. I also made an extra attachment so I can set it on a flat surface for those times when the timer setting is needed. I'm going to test it out in a plastic bag to keep the rain off. I will also build in a wrist strap in version 2 to limit the chance of dropping it while on the go."
