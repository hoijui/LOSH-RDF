function: ok, this is a last ditch effort to get my bowden cable to stay in place. it looks like it is holding so far. try it yourself and see if it works for you. it uses a bunch of small nails to bite into plastic tubing be it teflon or polypropylene. included is a parametric file that you can change for example if you want to use screws.
