function: "COFFEE CHANGE TIME INDICATOR-\r\n\r\nBasically it takes the place of you writing the time the coffee was made. it has a dial that you turn to the time you make the coffee. I saw people writing down times last week when coffee was changed, because otherwise we get drinking 2 day old crappy coffee, and when i changed the coffee i had to go look for a pen... Now with this, no more pen and paper, we know what time the coffee was made, so we can assure our picky selves fresh coffee! :) see picture for details!"
