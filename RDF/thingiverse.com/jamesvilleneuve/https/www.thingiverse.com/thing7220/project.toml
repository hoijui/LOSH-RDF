function = "This is a simple cut out of oak wood paneling that is in the shape of the bottom of wades gear. the wood large hole is set to be 15mm and atight fit for the ptfe barrier. it provides sturdy directional control over the hot end, and provides a thermal barrier to the wade gear above. the theory is that less heat being dissipated by the plastic will slow down or prevent warping and increase the life of extruder."
