function = "This is for those people that want to print the tall X axis Prusa parts, and have warping issues. I did some experiments with placing separate walls structures around the outside square corners of the parts and successfully printed these without rafts. The walls act as thermal jackets, and allow the base of the parts to retain heat during build. Slower cooling of parts prevents a lot of warping. It does not matter that the jackets curl at the end of the build, you just pull them off. I include a picture of the finished stl files that printed raft free."
