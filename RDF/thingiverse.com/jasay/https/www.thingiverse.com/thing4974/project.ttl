I didn't want to leave this half finished though so now that I've printed and tested, I'm updating with new models and the original Inventor files.  If I get a chance I may try to figure out how to model this in Openscad.\r

A fun and confusing toy that will rotate freely in one directly, but when spun the opposite direction will stop, wobble, and reverse directions.\r
