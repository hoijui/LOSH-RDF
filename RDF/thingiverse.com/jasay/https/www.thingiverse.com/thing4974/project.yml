function: "Edit: I had some trouble with this originally and VeryWetPaint was nice enough to fix some things and uploaded a derivative.  I didn't want to leave this half finished though so now that I've printed and tested, I'm updating with new models and the original Inventor files.  If I get a chance I may try to figure out how to model this in Openscad.\r\n\r\nA fun and confusing toy that will rotate freely in one directly, but when spun the opposite direction will stop, wobble, and reverse directions.\r\n\r\nMore on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattleback\r\n\r\nUploaded at the request of Spacexula"
