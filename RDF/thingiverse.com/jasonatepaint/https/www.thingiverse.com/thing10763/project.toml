function = "I needed a way to attach a bike light to the back of my segway so that I'd be seen at night. I used one of the available rear mount points (used for accessories) so I designed this in SketchUp. \r\n\r\nI was inspired after I saw gpvillamil's bike light mount: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8947. This is the first official \"useful\" project on my ToM.  The first month was spent printing lots of spiders, lions, and octopus variations.  ;-)"
