\r
After a lot of searching around for an air-horn, I decided on the Galforce two-tone bicycle horn/siren. It sounds nothing like a real police siren but it's quite loud and good for getting pedestrian traffic attention at a distance. The ACTUAL reason for the Galeforce was for the air-horn. It sounds just like the air-horn setup on police/fire/safety vehicles. It's super loud with a lipo S4 (14.8v) battery... in fact you don't ever want to use it in doors.... or maybe you do.  It certainly will stop an office building of workers in their tracks (or so I've heard. ;-))\r
\r
The mount is designed to rest snuggly against the curvature of the bar. The STL is setup to put the horn on the right side of the handlebars, but you could easily mirror it to get mount the horn on the left.""" ;
