function: "This is a fix for the Kamenstein 4536 Perfect Tear Paper Towel Holder. Although a quick search on Amazon shows other manufacturers (Cuisinart) with the same tensioner design.               \r\n\r\nI loved this paper towel holder when I first bought it. But after a few months of use, the internal tensioner, which is a small plastic piece, slowly started losing it's teeth. With only 4 total teeth, the loss of any causes the holder to hold no tension on the paper towels. It's been like this for a year or more. I didn't have a 3D printer when I originally diagnosed the problem. \r\n\r\nSo if you have this great towel holder (with a huge design flaw), you can just print out replacement plastic parts."
