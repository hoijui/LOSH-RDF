function = "I quickly got sick of bending over with a flashlight to get a good look at my prints. I was hoping to use those easy 3M LED light strips, but with the shape of the Rostock platform, they just weren't going to work.\r\n\r\nMy first rev used regular 20mA white LEDs but the heat from the hotend caused the leds to fail one-by-one until they were all gone or flickering.\r\n\r\nI landed on some 1-watt LEDs that I'm running at a lower \"wattage\". I tried them cranked all the way up, but 3 at full power was absolutely blinding."
