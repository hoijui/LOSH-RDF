\r
My first rev used regular 20mA white LEDs but the heat from the hotend caused the leds to fail one-by-one until they were all gone or flickering.\r
\r
I landed on some 1-watt LEDs that I'm running at a lower "wattage". I tried them cranked all the way up, but 3 at full power was absolutely blinding.""" ;
