function: "The older Dyson models came with a charging dock, but for the middle-child in my Dyson vacuum family, the DC-31 didn't come with one.\r\n\r\nThis will work with the DC-35 too but that model already comes with a dock\r\n\r\nNote:  Based on recent comments, it appears that the dock may be a tight fit with the newer style battery packs. (I think)."
