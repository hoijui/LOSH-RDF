    okh:function """A set of parametric OpenSCAD scripts that generate ready-to-print two-part molds from arbitrary STL models.  \r
\r
These scripts can be used to generate either **square** (with or without rounded corners) or **circular** two-part molds and are fully parameterized to make it easy to adapt for your application. \r
\r
Refer to the instructions below for some general tips, as well ideas for casting.  \r
\r
I have successfully made casts from these molds using wax, Knox gelatin, Oogoo and chocolate. If you have success with other casting media, please leave a comment!  \r
\r
Many more pictures of molds and castings I made with these scripts:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/zenwebb/collections/72157631531182783/  \r
\r
If you'd like to read about the development process for these scripts, and learn from some of the issues I came across, check out:  \r
* [First experiment with 3D printing a two-part mold + gelatin casting](http://jason-webb.info/2012/10/first-experiment-with-3d-printing-a-two-part-mold-gelatin-casting/)\r
* [More experiments with 3D-printed two-part molds; refining the mold-generating and casting processes](http://jason-webb.info/2012/10/more-experiments-with-3d-printed-two-part-molds-refining-the-mold-generating-and-casting-processes/)\r
\r
If you really want to bring your molds and castings to the next level you can even try the ["lost ABS" (or lost PLA)](http://jason-webb.info/2012/11/lost-abs-experiment-with-3d-printed-objects-and-aluminum-casting/) process to turn it into metal!\r
\r
I have also uploaded a [parametric open-face mold generator](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32657) to create positive and negative molds.""" ;
