    okh:function """A pair of OpenSCAD scripts that can be used to generate either positive and negative open-face molds from arbitrary STL models.\r
\r
The positive open-face mold generator script takes your external STL model and combines it with a solid, flat base with or without walls.\r
\r
The negative open-face mold generator script takes your model and subtracts it from a solid base, leaving an indentation in the form of your model. You can use this script to create ice-cube trays by arranging multiple models in a single STL input file!\r
\r
I have included sample input and output files that you can use for inspiration, but there is much more you could do that I haven't documented. If you come up with a new use for these scripts, please post a photo and/or make a derivative!\r
\r
