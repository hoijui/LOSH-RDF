function: "A pair of OpenSCAD scripts that can be used to generate either positive and negative open-face molds from arbitrary STL models.\r\n\r\nThe positive open-face mold generator script takes your external STL model and combines it with a solid, flat base with or without walls.\r\n\r\nThe negative open-face mold generator script takes your model and subtracts it from a solid base, leaving an indentation in the form of your model. You can use this script to create ice-cube trays by arranging multiple models in a single STL input file!\r\n\r\nI have included sample input and output files that you can use for inspiration, but there is much more you could do that I haven't documented. If you come up with a new use for these scripts, please post a photo and/or make a derivative!\r\n\r\nI've provided some more information on my blog at: http://jason-webb.info/2012/11/making-3d-printable-open-face-molds-with-openscad-casting-experiments/"
