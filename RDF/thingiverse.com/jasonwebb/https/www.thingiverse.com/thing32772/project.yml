function: "This is a very simple, but helpful OpenSCAD script that can be used to generate three types of printing plates based on 2D DXF designs.\r\n\r\nEssentially, this script extrudes a 2D design (loaded from an external DXF file of your choice) and either adds or subtracts it from a flat plane to give an effect not unlike relief or intaglio work. You can take these plates and use them for embossings, debossings, stenciling and possibly even ink printing!\r\n\r\nI created this script to make it easier for undergraduate printmaking students at my university to explore 3D printing in their work, and to gain some experience with digital fabircation.\r\n\r\nYou can see more plates and prints made using this script at: http://www.flickr.com/photos/zenwebb/collections/72157631741058233/\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nI am not an experienced printmaker, so I may not have gotten all of the terms correct here!"
