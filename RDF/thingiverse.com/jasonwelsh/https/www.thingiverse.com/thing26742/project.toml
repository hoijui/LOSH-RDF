function = "Inspired by the Bane Thralls | Privateer Press this is just part of a larger sculpt I did.  The skull turned out a cool piece all by itsself so I decided to share it as a stand alone.\r\n\r\nI also adapted it to be more detailed under extruder plastic printing technology.\r\n\r\nThis is a stylized design and is not meant to be proportioned to a real human skull."
