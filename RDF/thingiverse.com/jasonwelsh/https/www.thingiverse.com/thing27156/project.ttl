http://www.visuallyinsane.org/3dport/banethrall/\r
\r
When I made my 3D Printer I decided to dig him up, and revamp him for print and walla a Bane Thrall was born.\r
\r
He was inspired by http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/cryx/units/bane-thralls-unit\r
\r
But as fan art goes he is created from scratch and was never scanned.\r
\r
Programs used  Zbrush and Blender""" ;
