function: "A Bane Thrall was one of many little models that sit on my desk as 28mm models do.   The little guys hang out and inspire creativity whenever I model out game characters.  This one was choosen to become an axe swinging psychopath and placed here.\r\nhttp://www.visuallyinsane.org/3dport/banethrall/\r\n\r\nWhen I made my 3D Printer I decided to dig him up, and revamp him for print and walla a Bane Thrall was born.\r\n\r\nHe was inspired by http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/cryx/units/bane-thralls-unit\r\n\r\nBut as fan art goes he is created from scratch and was never scanned.\r\n\r\nPrograms used  Zbrush and Blender"
