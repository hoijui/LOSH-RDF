But he has a tone of printable detail at all levels.   \r\n\r\nFirst inspired by the painting Nightmare -  then started to think Satyr fit him best.\r\n\r\nNow he hangs in my daughters doll house ;)\r\n\r\nWas basically a test to see how much detail can be printed and how much is lost.  I will print a Bigger painted one soon to replace the white one that is impossible to photograph for some reason."
