function = "So I wanted a super screwdriver!  Had to be small yet balanced, universal, yet fit in the palm of my hand, and able to be used with one hand.  \r\n\r\nNo lasers?  Na not this time ;)\r\n\r\nI present my swivel driver.\r\n\r\nUsed blender to add superness.\r\n\r\nAdded a small paw version with less weight and more plastic.   Still very balanced."
