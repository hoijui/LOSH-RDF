function: "Have something in life that you want to add a printed part to?\r\n\r\nHave a bolt but not sure the hole size to use for it?\r\n\r\nFact - Perimeters can add strength but they can also screw with your measurements.   Now I carry this little do dad with me.   \r\n\r\n  Sand it a little.... and write the following on it. \r\n\r\n(see pic)\r\n\r\nI added the blender file so you can get the bolt size or use the bolts as booleans.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bottom Row of nuts are measured on the flats and will help with those SAE / Metric moments in life.\r\n\r\nShow it to a chick on the first date... Chicks dig nerds...\r\n\r\n1mm is for wallet\r\n2mm is for pocket protector (snort)"
