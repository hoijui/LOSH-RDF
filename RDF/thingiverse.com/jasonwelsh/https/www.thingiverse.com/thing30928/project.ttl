UNTIL I got bored.    So the difference is the strength of the parts and the angle at which the fill gets filled.    For those that don't build other printers and own a replicator you would have no idea what the grass looks like on the other side.       So here is what you do if you have always relied on replicatorG and have never known how to slice any other way.\r

This is not a model but a way to make you models stronger if you only own a replicator.        There are other ways to do this but I wanted it to be simple for people that dont know much about slicing.""" ;
