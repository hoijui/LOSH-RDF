function = "This thing is one of the coolest things I've come up with.  Holds an arduino with breadboard. Has 2 drawers that you can store resistors / caps etc etc.   \n\n\n\nWhen the breadboard and drawer are gone, arduino with shield can be stored.  Lid protects whatever you have already setup on the proto-board.  \n\n\n\nI use a m3 allen wrench to hold it together when traveling around with it. Optional PLA \"Spike\" (See version 2 video on how to make a PLA spike)  \n\n\n\nThere are now two versions   \n\n\n\nVersion 1  \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgz2TJHEeOQ&feature=youtu.be  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2   \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA5m9EN-Muo&feature=youtu.be  \n\n\n\nYou can also use Gift Cards as the lids to the drawers for those people that would like to add that personal touch to a gift idea.  \n\n\n\nVideo uploading (stay tuned)  \n\nEnjoy!  \n\n\n\n\n\nGive credit to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27759   \n\n\n\nfor the arduino bumper!  \n\n\n\n\n\nWant one but don't have a printer?   \n\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/Nerditorium  \n\n\n\nAvailable in the following Color Combos.  \n\nOn Fire= Red, Yellow, Orange  \n\nJoker Special= Purple, Neon Green, Neon Red  \n\nIndustrial= Silver, Teal, Neon Green  \n\nHalloween Platter= Orange, Black, Neon Green   \n\n\n\nAre you a business that sells Arduino?
