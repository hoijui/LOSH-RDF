    okh:function """This thing is one of the coolest things I've come up with.  Holds an arduino with breadboard. Has 2 drawers that you can store resistors / caps etc etc.   



When the breadboard and drawer are gone, arduino with shield can be stored.  Lid protects whatever you have already setup on the proto-board.  



I use a m3 allen wrench to hold it together when traveling around with it. Optional PLA "Spike" (See version 2 video on how to make a PLA spike)  



There are now two versions   



Version 1

Version 2

You can also use Gift Cards as the lids to the drawers for those people that would like to add that personal touch to a gift idea.  



Video uploading (stay tuned)  

Enjoy!
