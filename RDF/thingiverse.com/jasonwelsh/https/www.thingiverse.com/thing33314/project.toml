function = "If you liked my other Arduino Lab this one is designed for xbee technology in mind. Holds a 9 volt battery in place to power the Arduino side.  The breadboard side holds the xbee sled for the USB connection along with any other experiments.\r\n\r\nHas mounting slots for microrax and makerbeam or any m3 mount.\r\n\r\nMakes a great base for mobile wireless inventions.\r\n\r\nUse it as a Jack-O-Lantern?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA preview of it in action can be found here.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7gjqjIV2lQ&safety_mode=true&persist_safety_mode=1&safe=active\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info on Xbee technology go here.  (Its older but still good).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTnC1bHoaDM&safety_mode=true&persist_safety_mode=1&safe=active"
