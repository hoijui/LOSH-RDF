function = "If a stormtrooper wanted an iPhone case this would be his weapon of choice.\r\n\r\nMANY MANY MANY prototypes died in the making of this case. I have been working on this thing for a pretty long time trying to get just the right level of nerd and battle ready into the design.\r\n\r\nThe Tank has a lid that protects the screen from kids - dogs - wolves - teenagers - terrorists ..... bring it is all I have to say.\r\n\r\nA lanyard hole has been added just in case your jumping from a plane and you wanted to check your email.\r\n\r\n\r\nScrews hold the design together, so no kids are taking this thing off unless their nibble little fingers can find a M3 allen wrench!\r\n\r\nAnyway if you have an extreme lifestyle and you want a case that will take a mortar shell.   \r\n\r\nEnjoy.  \r\n\r\nIm going to be adding these to my store if you intrested in a printed one.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/Nerditorium\r\n\r\nAvailable in color combos: \r\nOn Fire= Neon Red Case + Yellow Lid\r\nThe joker= Neon Green Case+ Purple Lid\r\nHunter Special= Orange Case + Yellow Lid\r\nThe StormTrooper= White Case + Black Lid \r\n\r\n\r\nOr Solids:\r\nBlack\r\nBlue\r\nYellow \r\nTeal  \r\nNeon Green \r\nNeon Red\r\nHunter Orange\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded a 2mm x20mm screw version for those that want less grip on the sides.  \r\n\r\nAlso added a itank girl (get it?)\r\nit is less tank like and has a larger area to get in there and text.   \r\nThis was inspired by a student of mine after it was revealed that her smaller paw could not text as easy with the iTank. My banana hands had no trouble but I chicken peck, these younger students have freeken home key positions for petes sake!\r\n\r\nAnyway that is the story of the new additions."
