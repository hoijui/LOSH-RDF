\r
MANY MANY MANY prototypes died in the making of this case. I have been working on this thing for a pretty long time trying to get just the right level of nerd and battle ready into the design.\r
\r
The Tank has a lid that protects the screen from kids - dogs - wolves - teenagers - terrorists ..... bring it is all I have to say.\r
\r
A lanyard hole has been added just in case your jumping from a plane and you wanted to check your email.\r
\r
\r
Screws hold the design together, so no kids are taking this thing off unless their nibble little fingers can find a M3 allen wrench!\r
\r
Anyway if you have an extreme lifestyle and you want a case that will take a mortar shell.   \r
\r
Enjoy.  \r
\r

Added a 2mm x20mm screw version for those that want less grip on the sides.  \r
\r
Also added a itank girl (get it?)\r
it is less tank like and has a larger area to get in there and text.   \r
This was inspired by a student of mine after it was revealed that her smaller paw could not text as easy with the iTank. My banana hands had no trouble but I chicken peck, these younger students have freeken home key positions for petes sake!\r
\r
Anyway that is the story of the new additions.""" ;
