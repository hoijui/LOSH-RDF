function = "So recently I have been on a quest for a sealer that will make ABS look amazing after you file or sand the ever living crap out of it.\r\n\r\nI like to sand harsh 90 degree corners on personal handheld products like the phone cases and Arduino labs.  The problem is it leaves sanding marks.\r\n\r\nAlso ABS glue leaves behind a shinny look in areas that does not look pleasant.\r\n\r\nI bring you more of a public service information than a Thing-A-Ma-jig.\r\n\r\nOther clear coats just do not even cut it or feel sticky after awhile.  These do not!\r\n\r\nBoth products work about the same except I like Valspar frosting much better.\r\n\r\nIt dries so fast! and covers the most aggressive tooling.\r\n\r\n\r\nValspar works on PLA also.  Rustoleum FAILS on PLA. \r\n\r\nSee attached photos of test.\r\nI hope you enjoy the tip ;)"
