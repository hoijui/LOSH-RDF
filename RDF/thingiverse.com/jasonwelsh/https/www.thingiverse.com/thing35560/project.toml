function = "Used to wedge cracks, prop open stuff. When thrown will return back to you. Can be used as a defense weapon against the blind.  Makes a great Zombie brain jam scoop.\r\n\r\nI felt this derivative was needed because mine has bumps also on the inside to warble more stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow everyone print one and post a picture of what you did with your warble wobble!\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer- Blind people can't hurt you so no pictures of blind defense maneuvers."
