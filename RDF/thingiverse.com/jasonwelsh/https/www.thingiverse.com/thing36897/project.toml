Needed to keep my experiments stored and mobile.  \r\n2. Needed wire management!\r\n3. Needed an area to store components. (optional)\r\n4. Needed to fold and look darn cool when it was folded.\r\n5. Needed to be slightly parametric height design. (just print more threads for height)\r\n6. Needed mounting rails for upgrades.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the new thing!\r\n\r\nDon't have a 3D printer? Want this product?  go here and I will print and ship you one or many.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/117389802/arduino-book-case-portable\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to learn how to use an Arduino?\r\nJoin the class ;)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9MUC-YxhJ6Dv3d_03Ev0MumvJsZAqg0t&feature=view_all"
