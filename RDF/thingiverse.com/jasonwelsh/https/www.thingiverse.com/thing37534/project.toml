function = "Imagine taking a case, programing your Arduino for awhile with bits of code.  Saying to yourself one day \"I want to play with servos\"  Take your case print out the tank tread mod and away you go.   That is the goal for my project.   Easy upgrades... constant change without regrets.    So when a pair of tank treads show up on thingiverse I was on that with a passion.\r\n\r\nThese treads are a great design... They needed to be upgraded a little to fit my design but nothing that could not be modeled in blender.\r\n\r\nWheels now have 2mm holes for the servo wheel plate to connect to the wheels.\r\n\r\nServos are screwed down, no more rubber band.\r\n\r\nidler is still a good idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLost the Scad because well the only thing that might change is the servo size but I tried to use a very common standard size in the build.  Links are provided in the instructions to everything you need for this mod."
