function = "What does a tank need ?\r\n\r\nArmor!\r\nGuns!\r\n\r\nOk so the armor is plastic and the guns are actually printable IR proximity sensors.\r\n\r\nWhat?  noooo.......  you can do that?\r\nSort of..... they are actually just parts from crap shack assembled in a sexy new package that works like those expensive 14 dollar IR sensors found on most electronic sites.   Mine are 3 dollars to build!\r\n\r\nAll together this mod will give you.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 printable Infrared Proximity Sensors. \r\n\r\nArmor side plates with new mounting holes. \r\n\r\nA front bumper that can hold even more sensors. \r\n\r\nIm leaveing this thing as a Work in progress just because I will have more sensors in the future.\r\n\r\nFor Robot in action without Sonar click here\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AseCKmbZbVw"
