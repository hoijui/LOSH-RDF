function = "I am a firm believer in universal and expandable.  \r\n \r\nI have found tank treads to be an art form in itself!  \r\n\r\nNothing was working for me off of  Thingiverse as far as \"Tank Treads\" because most designs were already built for some robot or too big or too small so I needed something that was \"Just right\".   And sturdy / easy to build.... \r\n\r\nSo I made some universal ones with the idea that others might be in the same boat.\r\n\r\nThese are for small to medium sized bots if your bot is larger than 12in by 12in I would find a different build though.    \r\n\r\n6in by 6in for the smaller cap.    \r\n\r\n\r\nThey are test driven and work great!\r\n\r\nWant to buy the Kit?\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/119500536/universal-tank-tread-kit"
