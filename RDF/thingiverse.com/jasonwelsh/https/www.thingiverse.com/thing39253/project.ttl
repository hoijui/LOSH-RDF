 \r
I have found tank treads to be an art form in itself!  \r
\r
Nothing was working for me off of  Thingiverse as far as "Tank Treads" because most designs were already built for some robot or too big or too small so I needed something that was "Just right".   And sturdy / easy to build.... \r
\r
So I made some universal ones with the idea that others might be in the same boat.\r
\r
These are for small to medium sized bots if your bot is larger than 12in by 12in I would find a different build though.    \r
\r
6in by 6in for the smaller cap.    \r
\r
\r
They are test driven and work great!\r
