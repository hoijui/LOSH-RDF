Did I mention small?  
I started by finding a micro breadboard in a drawer and whispering to myself "useless".  
Then I said wait this will fit on my Arduino Book Case Tank!.  "Brilliant"!  
But I had no holder so I started making one, then another idea "Coffee"  
I was tired....  
Anywho this is deemed "The Button Box" because it is powered by two 2032 button batteries.  It is a small little lab that fits in your pocket that you can use to hold all manner of tiny experiments.   
As it started to take form I thought it would be a great tool for an electronics instructor.  
Here students here is a small box that has power....... here are the rules... and now create!  
Insert your rules here____________.  
If you feel lost and confused please watch this video.
