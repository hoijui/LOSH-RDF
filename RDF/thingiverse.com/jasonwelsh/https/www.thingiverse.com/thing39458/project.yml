function: "So for today's invention I have this nifty little thing that is small, folds and is powered.  \nDid I mention small?  \nI started by finding a micro breadboard in a drawer and whispering to myself \"useless\".  \nThen I said wait this will fit on my Arduino Book Case Tank!.  \"Brilliant\"!  \nBut I had no holder so I started making one, then another idea \"Coffee\"  \nI was tired....  \nAnywho this is deemed \"The Button Box\" because it is powered by two 2032 button batteries.  It is a small little lab that fits in your pocket that you can use to hold all manner of tiny experiments.   \nAs it started to take form I thought it would be a great tool for an electronics instructor.  \nHere students here is a small box that has power....... here are the rules... and now create!  \nInsert your rules here____________.  \nIf you feel lost and confused please watch this video.  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TijZiMpBf8Y&feature=youtu.be  \nI hope you enjoy!"
