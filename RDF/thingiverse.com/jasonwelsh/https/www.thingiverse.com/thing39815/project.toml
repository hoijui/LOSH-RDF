Print it...\r\n\r\nGive to daughter when she first wakes up.\r\n\r\nI can't even imagine what this world looks like to our kids.\r\n\r\nI had a ton of these \"Bucky Balls\" on the fridge holding up sad expired coupons and a few coloring book pages. \r\n\r\nSuddenly an idea hit.  Use them to connect things!\r\n\r\nPractice this new idea while having fun is always time for a new toy invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThis time I searched thingiverse before I released.  There was something that used the Bucky Balls, but ya I still wanted to release my idea/version. I felt it was pretty different anyway.\r\n\r\nAges 3+ up  / use best judgement + Swallowing a magnet can kill you!"
