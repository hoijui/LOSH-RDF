\r
Give to daughter when she first wakes up.\r
\r
I can't even imagine what this world looks like to our kids.\r
\r
I had a ton of these "Bucky Balls" on the fridge holding up sad expired coupons and a few coloring book pages. \r
\r
Suddenly an idea hit.  Use them to connect things!\r
\r
Practice this new idea while having fun is always time for a new toy invention.\r
\r
\r
\r
Enjoy.\r
\r
Disclaimer:\r
This time I searched thingiverse before I released.  There was something that used the Bucky Balls, but ya I still wanted to release my idea/version. I felt it was pretty different anyway.\r
