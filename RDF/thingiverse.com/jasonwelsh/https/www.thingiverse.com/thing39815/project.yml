function: "Wake up early, Yawn... Make Tea.  Make something new to play with... Print it...\r\n\r\nGive to daughter when she first wakes up.\r\n\r\nI can't even imagine what this world looks like to our kids.\r\n\r\nI had a ton of these \"Bucky Balls\" on the fridge holding up sad expired coupons and a few coloring book pages. \r\n\r\nSuddenly an idea hit.  Use them to connect things!\r\n\r\nPractice this new idea while having fun is always time for a new toy invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThis time I searched thingiverse before I released.  There was something that used the Bucky Balls, but ya I still wanted to release my idea/version. I felt it was pretty different anyway.\r\n\r\nAges 3+ up  / use best judgement + Swallowing a magnet can kill you!"
