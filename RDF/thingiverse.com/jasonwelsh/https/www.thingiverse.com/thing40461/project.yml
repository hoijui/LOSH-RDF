function: "So I have one pair of calipers and they are not looking too pretty.\r\n\r\nWith each backpack trip I see then fading fast.\r\n\r\nSo I think to myself maybe, just maybe somebody made a travel case for calipers.\r\n\r\nNope...    So I guess I must come to the rescue for the sake of all those who travel with their calipers.\r\n\r\nOf course wearing this in public will instantly attract the chicks  ;)\r\n\r\nEnjoy."
