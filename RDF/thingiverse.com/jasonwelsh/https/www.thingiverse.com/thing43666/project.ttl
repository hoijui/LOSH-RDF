Teaching Junior and Senior high school students the latest in all things digital.\r
\r
Anyway I have 3D printers in the classroom and students wanting to print things who have never touched a 3D application in their life. \r
\r
I want them to be able to create things.\r
Not just download from thingiverse and print but actually make and print stuff of their own.\r
\r
One of the things I like doing is breaking down problems into chapters, and back everything I teach with videos. This way they have a reference point. I usually post the video series on youtube but use the video files themselves in the classroom.\r
\r
So I am inviting the community to the show.\r
\r
If you're new to 3D printing and have never modeled before this would be a great start for you.. This class focuses on software vs hardware, Design vs durability, and shows you workflows for many different situations that you come accross trying to produce a good printed part.\r
\r
I am using Blender-Slic3r-Printrun in the workflows, but really it translates well to other applications as long as you follow the same terminology.\r

\r
Are you a slow learner and need an extra slow course before you hop into printing?\r
\r

\r
If you have ideas for examples that would be good for new developers as far as small lessons that do not take up huge amount of plastic post them here!\r
\r
This remains a work in progress until all chapters have been produced. As things are made for the series I will post the stls here. So if you see something you might want to try and make you have an example here to look at.\r
\r
I ask to keep the troll level down a notch maybe , I know certain audiences like to kill the messenger before they physically try something or hear something mispronounced and raise their pudgy little arm.. So yes you linux and ard-ween-oo users I am talking to you ;) In the heat of polygon land battles my last thought is my slipping of the tongue.\r
\r
So keep in mind young users watching the videos on youtube also.... Keep it clean or I will delete the comment. \r
\r
\r
Other than that enjoy!""" ;
