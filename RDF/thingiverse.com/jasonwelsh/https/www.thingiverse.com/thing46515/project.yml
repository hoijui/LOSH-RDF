function: "Made a base frame design that fits around a business card.   Nothing that you can take over the world with, but when added with a boolean of your choosing you can come up with some pretty intresting designs for your cards.\r\n\r\nI see 3d printed cards but this is a nice mix of paper and plastic to promote your skills.\r\n\r\nSample boolean logos included."
