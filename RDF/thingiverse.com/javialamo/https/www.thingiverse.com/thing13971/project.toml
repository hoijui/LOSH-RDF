Holes make accesible all conectors.\r\nSkymega is an original design by Juan GonzÃ¡lez-GÃ³mez, AndrÃ©s Prieto-Moreno and Itziar Lima Ramos.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: ItÂ´s marked as Work in Progress because I havenÂ´t printed it yet. Some tests are necessary to make the board fits perfectly.\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n- The box is now in two stl files, easiest to print."
