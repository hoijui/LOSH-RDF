function = "The first thing I made - a nut for a lead screw (RS part 703-9389). I got the screw from RS, but nuts are 1+month back order.  Took 20 min to print, and has been running fine for the month.  Was worried about how good ABS would be, but if it wears out, I know where to get more spares!\r\nPS - battling to upload images - will try and get better ones up"
