function: "I went to RadioShack and found a package of switches that had a nice click to them. All of them were expensive for a single one until I found one that would work for exactly what I needed. There was a slight notch in the hole so the switch stays in place.\r\n\r\nThe one I found at my local RadoShack was this http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12688419 except it was a double pack for mounting in a vehicle."
