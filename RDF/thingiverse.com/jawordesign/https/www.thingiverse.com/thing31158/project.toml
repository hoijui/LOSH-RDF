function = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-lorciobkc&feature=youtu.be  \n\nThis extruder maximizes travel in X and Z axis, by positioning the motor in lowest possible position on the carriage. The motor is perpendicular to X axis, mounted by two screws tightening it from the top (none of four standard M3 screws are used).  \n\nThe body is mounted on the carriage only with one screw, allowing very quick detachment/attachment (it's sort of clip-on really). It's also very rigid at the same time - no wobble even at high speeds.  \n\nNEW : The carriage can also be used with zMorph DREMEL mount - so you can turn your printer into a milling machine!  \nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:46986  \n\n(more information on zMorph 3d printer can be found on http://reprap.org/wiki/Zmorph)"
