function = "Just another filament spool, designed to be makerbot printable, relatively cheap to make and free spinning, and it doesn't require an overly tuned makerbot to print.\r\n\r\nInspired in part by : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4641 which is an even easier option for a filament spool\r\n\r\nAlso usefull as a cheap revolving tabletop thing (note that the spokes tilt slightly upwards before attempting to put anything flat on it), unsure yet of how much weight it will hold.\r\n\r\nI'm planning on adding more components (such as a bolt on filament guide and central core to hold the filament neatly) so more to come.\r\n\r\nNote: Numbers on part filenames are just part of my rudimentry version management\r\n\r\n01-DEC-2010: Filament Guide Add-on Kit now available from: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4982"
