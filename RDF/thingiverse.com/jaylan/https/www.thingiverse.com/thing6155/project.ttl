    okh:function """My cupcake makerbot's x-axis stepper recently started skipping steps, causing majorly mis-aligned (tower of pisa style) builds - after checking nothing was getting in its way, fiddling for hours with the trimpot on the stepper controller, and oiling the guide rods it seemed the stepper was just plain overheating (Sydney's recent 40+ degree celcius weather probably wasn't helping).\r
\r
Adding a fan to cool the x-axis stepper instantly solved the problem for me - so I made this mount to clip into the cupcake's side port, to hold the fan in place.\r
