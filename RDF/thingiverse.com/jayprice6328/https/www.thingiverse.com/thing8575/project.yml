function: "This thing is a mouse trap car made by a laser cutter, the files below (odg, cst) are open office and roland cut studio files, each type has the same cuts needed to make the car. This car is not specifically made for speed or distance but more of a solid base for a mouse trap of any kind.\r\n\r\nALSO! the way i was able to fit the pencils into the CD was the adapter made by MJCbull, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8300"
