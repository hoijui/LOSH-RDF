function: "since i had my car my gas door would always open up when i park because the ring on my lock was broken. Not anymore, i shaved the thing off and replaced it with this sturdy piece. The picture i have taken is of the broken piece and the one in sketch-up is the replacement.\r\n\r\nPS. I know this isn't the most effective way to fix your gas door but hey! it works!"
