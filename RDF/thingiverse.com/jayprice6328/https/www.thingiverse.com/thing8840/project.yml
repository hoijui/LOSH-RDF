function: I have taken a fancy to laser cut clothing designs so i decided to make some, i think the coolest of them all would be this angel wing cut that is made for the back of your shirt, i used a laser cutter with a 24" by 12" bed at speed 80, power 100 and freaquency 400. Have fun :) and be sure to post any other cool designs you have made.
