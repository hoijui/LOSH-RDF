function: "I did not make this thing! i have just come across it as had to make and decided to share it since it is not a \"thing\" on Thingiverse! Very serprising.\r\n\r\nA 3-Dimentional mammouth that consists of many different seperate slide-in pieces. Can be a toy or even a gift \"just because\". I suggest a better material that isnt so sore on the eye while useing cardboard."
