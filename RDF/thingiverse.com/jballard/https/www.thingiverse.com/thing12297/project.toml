function = "This thing is a mount to put cooling fans on both sides of your MK7 extruder in a single extruder setup.  This setup is for a non traditional mounting setup, it probably will not work on your thingamatic without work.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to cool both the plastic being printed and the part itself using 2 30mm fans.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to use 2 self threading screws from above to attach to the MK7 mounting plate.\r\n\r\nI have included all of the Autodesk 2012 files including the assembly file.  If any other file types are wanted request them I may be able to post them.\r\n\r\nThe part assumes you have 1 inch between the bottom of the nozzle to the bottom of the mounting plate.\r\n\r\nI will print as soon as I get a replacement stepper driver in the mail.\r\n\r\nAnd for those of you opening it in inventor I have no idea how it became a sheet metal part, but it makes no difference when generating the stl."
