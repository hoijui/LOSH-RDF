    okh:function """This thing is a mount to put cooling fans on both sides of your MK7 extruder in a single extruder setup.  This setup is for a non traditional mounting setup, it probably will not work on your thingamatic without work.\r
\r
It is designed to cool both the plastic being printed and the part itself using 2 30mm fans.\r
\r
It is designed to use 2 self threading screws from above to attach to the MK7 mounting plate.\r
\r
I have included all of the Autodesk 2012 files including the assembly file.  If any other file types are wanted request them I may be able to post them.\r
\r
The part assumes you have 1 inch between the bottom of the nozzle to the bottom of the mounting plate.\r
\r
I will print as soon as I get a replacement stepper driver in the mail.\r
\r
And for those of you opening it in inventor I have no idea how it became a sheet metal part, but it makes no difference when generating the stl.""" ;
