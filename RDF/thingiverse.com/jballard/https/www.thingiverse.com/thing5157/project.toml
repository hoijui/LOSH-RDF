function = "This is the wades extruder block, with a few modifications to allow the addition of the MK5 hot end.  The hot end may not work on a Mendel.  But I can verify that it will bolt up to this modified extruder block.\r\n\r\nI have only bolted the hot end up, I have not turned it on or done any other testing, I am still making a few parts for it.  I have replaced the ptfe spacers on the hot ends with some aluminum heatsinks to try and cut down on heat transfer into the extruder block.  I also have modified the extruder block so some metal plates can be used to distribute the load across the top of the extuder block where the MK5 bolts are attached.\r\n\r\nThis is a test object, like I said it will bolt up to the hot end, maybe not your printer, and it may not function, use at your own risk.  I will up load pics later, and will update as needed."
