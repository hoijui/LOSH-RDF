function: "This is a fan mount for a round bodied nema 23 stepper motor.  Intended for use using a 80mm fan\r\n\r\nIt should snap on and hold itself on, I plan on using some double sided tape to ensure that it holds itself on.\r\n\r\nIt may be overkill but the mount is also designed to direct the air around the motor.\r\n\r\nIt was created in Autodesk Inventor 2011, IPT file is included along with a STL and IGES file if you choose to edit this thing."
