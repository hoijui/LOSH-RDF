function = "This is a small part that you use to fix the Z-Stage on the four threaded rods. Cupcake CNC developers only included 4 of them, fixing the Z-Stage from the top. However, it is useful to fix it also from the bottom to prevent it 'jumping off' the nuts. I found the DXF on thingiverse, however for some reason I failed to convert it to STL miserably. :) \r\n\r\nSo I created this part myself using a real-world ruler and openScad (openScad is a damn cool piece of software that uses simple programming language to create 3D parts). Here is the openScad source if you wanna play with it:\r\n\r\nr=2; // mount hole radius (m3)\r\nt=5; // part thickness\r\n\r\ndifference() {\r\n\r\n\tunion() {\r\n\tcube([30,10,t]);\r\n\ttranslate ([0,10,0]) cube([15,10,t]);\r\n\ttranslate ([0,20,0]) cube([30,10,t]);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tunion() {\r\n\ttranslate([5,5,0]) cylinder(t,r,r); // holes\r\n\ttranslate([25,5,0]) cylinder(t,r,r);\r\n\ttranslate([5,25,0]) cylinder(t,r,r);\r\n\ttranslate([25,25,0]) cylinder(t,r,r);\r\n\r\n\ttranslate([5,5,0]) cylinder(2,3,3); // nut placeholders\r\n\ttranslate([25,5,0]) cylinder(2,3,3); \r\n\ttranslate([5,25,0]) cylinder(2,3,3); \r\n\ttranslate([25,25,0]) cylinder(2,3,3); \r\n\r\n\ttranslate([30,30,0]) cylinder(t,3,3); // side arcs\r\n\ttranslate([0,30,0]) cylinder(t,3,3);\r\n\ttranslate([0,0,0]) cylinder(t,3,3);\r\n\ttranslate([30,0,0]) cylinder(t,3,3);\r\n\r\n\ttranslate([15,15,0]) cylinder(t,5,5); // center arc\r\n\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe part is basically a 30x30mm thing with 10mm whole in the center, 4 holes on the sides (5mm away from part edge), and 4 nut placeholders. I included the placeholders so that we could use the bolts that came in original batch, otherwise you'd need longer bolts.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
