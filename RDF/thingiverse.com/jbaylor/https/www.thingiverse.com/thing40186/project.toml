function = "These are three acrylic cases for an Arduino and OLED.   They are meant to be inside a box with the face plate attaching it to a control panel.   \n\n-----  \n- This was cut from cast 3mm clear acrylic.  \n- The minimum sheet size is:  7.50\"x3.25\"  \n- Holes are for 3mm bolts.  \n-  Stand offs are needed below Arduino (6mm) and between these two sheets (measure what you need after assembly and cut 1\" stand offs down to size).  \n- The OLED is soldered on an empty Adafruit Proto Shield.  \n- The redesigned files are for a larger face plate with holes for 3 buttons and a USB.  There are two sizes.  This design has an additional perf board for the buttons.  \n\nThe functions for this implementation:  \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdFwjwNojnQ  \n\nIf you want the circuits and part numbers, let me know and I can post more details."
