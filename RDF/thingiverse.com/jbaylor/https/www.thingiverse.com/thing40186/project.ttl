    okh:function """These are three acrylic cases for an Arduino and OLED.   They are meant to be inside a box with the face plate attaching it to a control panel.   

-----  
- This was cut from cast 3mm clear acrylic.  
- The minimum sheet size is:  7.50"x3.25"  
- Holes are for 3mm bolts.  
-  Stand offs are needed below Arduino (6mm) and between these two sheets (measure what you need after assembly and cut 1" stand offs down to size).  
- The OLED is soldered on an empty Adafruit Proto Shield.  
- The redesigned files are for a larger face plate with holes for 3 buttons and a USB.  There are two sizes.  This design has an additional perf board for the buttons.  

The functions for this implementation:

If you want the circuits and part numbers, let me know and I can post more details.""" ;
