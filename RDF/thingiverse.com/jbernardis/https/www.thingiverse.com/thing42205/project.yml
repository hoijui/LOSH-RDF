function: "This is a collection of new pieces for wired1's OB1 printer design to get more print height.  The original OB1 only gave me 106mm of print height, not much of an improvement over the prusa I was replacing.  By designing new corners and new apex pieces, I now have a max height of 188mm.\r\n\r\nThe first image shows the height limit I was reaching on the unmodified OB1.  The X belt was hitting the frame while I still had quite a bit of vertical room.  The other images show the new corner, the new apex, and the entire modified printer."
