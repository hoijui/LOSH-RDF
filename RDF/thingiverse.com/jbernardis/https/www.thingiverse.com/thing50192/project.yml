function: "I've always admired the laser cut boxes I've seen here and wondered whether or not it could be duplicated with 3D printers.  I've seen boxes designed like this, but always for a specific purpose.  I wanted the ability to create a box to the dimensions of my choosing.\r\n\r\nTo this end, I developed a python/tkinter script that allows you to specify box parameters and it generates clean OpenSCAD source code.  Cut and paste the code right into OpenSCAD, hit F5, and you're just about ready to print.\r\n\r\nEach face of the box is rendered with a separate module so that they can be printed one at a time allowing you to make further modifications, such as openings or mounting brackets."
