function: "My printer was having problems clearing other glass hold down clips so I fabricated these out of scrap aluminum bar. These clips use a hole drilled in the wooden plate under the build plate of all Printrbots to clamp down the glass and stay away from the print head.  \n\nCAUTION IF DONE INCORRECTLY THESE CAN BREAK GLASS. Standard glass handling rules apply. Dont over tighten these clamps.  \nI didnt make sure the other bolt beside the clip(seen above the clip in the picture) was lower then the heater pcb and when i tightened the clamps down the glass cracked.  \nBe sure to check for a flat surface without any bad bumps that could crack the glass when it is tightened down."
