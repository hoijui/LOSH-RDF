function = "I made four of these music boxes as christmas gifts to my family.  The PDF pattern was generated with a Processing script, which I wrote.  I've included the script for reference, although you only need the PDF to produce copies of the box.  Each box is laser cut from a single piece of 12x12 plywood.\r\n\r\nHere's a video of my daughter on Christmas:  http://youtu.be/n9I88Lt0zUw\r\n\r\nThe lid of the box contains an inlaid Hilbert curve, a kind of space-filling fractal.  A more detailed Hilbert curve is etched into the bottom of the box.  The sides of the box contain inlays or holes in the shape of the letter J, which is the first initial of each of my four family members.\r\n\r\nThe pieces of the box fit together like a puzzle.  Each side contains a single letter J, which I dyed different colors, using food coloring.  These could also have been left as holes, to make the box louder.\r\n\r\nThe crank hole is designed for a very common type of hand-cranked movement, of which Kikkerland is one manufacturer."
