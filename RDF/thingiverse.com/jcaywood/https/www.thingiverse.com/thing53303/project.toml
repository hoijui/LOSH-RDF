function = "I needed an adapter from a Budaschnozzle to a J-Head type mount for Wired1's \"Highly accessible vertXtruder for OB1.4\" which is under development still. It doesn't allow for the normal shoe mounting that many Wade type extruders do.\r\n\r\nAdded a second version for anti-rotation for use with through bolt retainer designs. Left the circular groove version as an alternate.\r\n\r\n3/1 Updated the Anti-Rotation version. The screw engagement area diameter on the cylindrical section was was decreased from 2.9mm to 2.75mm which is just enough to get the screws through with a little work and provide stiffer mounting.\r\n\r\nThis is my first thing and I'm not an exemplary 3D artist in 123D, but I don't have a copy of my favorite program anymore so it's time to learn new things!"
