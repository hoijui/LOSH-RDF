    okh:function """I needed an adapter from a Budaschnozzle to a J-Head type mount for Wired1's "Highly accessible vertXtruder for OB1.4" which is under development still. It doesn't allow for the normal shoe mounting that many Wade type extruders do.\r
\r
Added a second version for anti-rotation for use with through bolt retainer designs. Left the circular groove version as an alternate.\r
\r
3/1 Updated the Anti-Rotation version. The screw engagement area diameter on the cylindrical section was was decreased from 2.9mm to 2.75mm which is just enough to get the screws through with a little work and provide stiffer mounting.\r
\r
This is my first thing and I'm not an exemplary 3D artist in 123D, but I don't have a copy of my favorite program anymore so it's time to learn new things!""" ;
