function: "wile i don't have enough money to finish my 3d printer i am working on things to make with it.\r\nthis is just something because i didn't like the normal calibration cube.\r\n\r\ni use autodesk inventor to create the stl files, so i don't know how they will come out. if anyone can give me any insite on how to better process the stl file that would be great."
