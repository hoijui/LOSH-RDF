function = "These pillow blocks wrap the RapMan X and Y axis bearings in a nice comfy pillow instead of pinching them between bolts and acrylic sheets.\r\n\r\nWhy would you want to do this?\r\n\r\n  * Bearings run smoother when not pinched.\r\n  * It greatly reduces the RapMan's rain of falling nuts and washers.\r\n  * You can tighten these down with only a single hex wrench.\r\n  * You wont easily snap the acrylic parts when you tighten them.\r\n  * They are more stable.\r\n  * They look cool.\r\n\r\nThese are similar to the pillow blocks that can be found here: http://wiki.bitsfrombytes.com/index.php?title=Spare_parts but are a new design with several features the others don't have:\r\n\r\n  * These pillow blocks are not closed and can be installed with out taking the bearings off the rail so they require much less disassembly.\r\n  * There is a backstop inside which makes centering the bearing easy.\r\n  * There are insets for the bottom nuts which both keeps them from spinning out and makes them easier to tighten.\r\n  * These don't change the height of the extruder or x-axis.\r\n  * They come with a cool bearing packing tool.\r\n\r\nThese were designed to be easy to print and to fit the nuances of the RapMan.  If you want a general purpose pillow block then the front x-axis block is a good place to start.\r\n\r\nAll of the STL files were generated from the OpenSCAD and .dxf files.  The .dxf was created with QCad.\r\n\r\nI also highly recommend replacing the z-axis drive gear with the one at the bottom of this page: http://wiki.bitsfrombytes.com/index.php?title=Spare_parts and replacing your extruder gears with these: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4650  I haven't gotten these: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4398 to print cleanly yet but they look interesting too.\r\n\r\nWith these pillow blocks and the replacement gears my RapMan is starting to become a reliable and smooth running printing machine.  Maybe they should call it the StRapMan."
