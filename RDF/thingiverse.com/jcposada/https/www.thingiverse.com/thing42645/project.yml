function: "This design is based on the one published by whpthomas at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:41090.\r\n\r\nHowever after printing his, I realized that indicators with the stub on the back for mounting to a magnetic base would not fit, so I simply modified his design to fit my indicator.\r\n\r\nUPDATE - Feb 4 2013\r\nI uploaded a new STL with a cutout to accomodate the version of whpthomas' Extruder Upgrade http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42250 that has the tab on the pinch arm."
