function = "This is a printable enclosure for the open source, DIY O2 headphone amplifier, designed by NwAvGuy: http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/08/o2-details.html\r\n\r\nO2 was designed to fit a Box B2-080 aluminum housing. The front panel of the O2 has two 3.5mm jacks, a power LED, a power switch, gain switch, DC jack, and a volume knob. To actually use the intended aluminum case, you'd need precise tools and machining skills...\r\n\r\nThis design is an easier DIY solution for the O2. Note that the case body is simpler and narrower than the B2-080 case. The front panel is thus slightly wider than the printable enclosure body, but was modeled to fit both this 3D model, or the actual B2-080 aluminum body."
