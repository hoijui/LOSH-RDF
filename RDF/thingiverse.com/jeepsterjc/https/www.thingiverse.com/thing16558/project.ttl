    okh:function """Are you having cooling troubles with your hotend?  Filament jambs?  Too much fiddling with cleaning up stuck filament and too many dis-assemblies?  This is one good solution.  This replacement x-carriage should help anyone out who prints with pla or abs.  Many fiament jambs happen when the hotend becomes heat saturated higher up.  Then filament softens then as the filament is driven downward it mushrooms out and jambs higher up in the nozzle.\r
\r
I didn't find one that I liked so I put this together to direct a nice cool flow of air to the upper portion of the hot-end.  It takes a common 40 mm cpu/gpu fan and is a really clean method to attach a fan.  \r
\r
I hope it is useful for everyone needing better cooliing for the hotend.\r
\r
I've uploaded the final V4 STL called "xcarriagev4done_fixed.stl".  It has been passed through Netfabb and is only 2.6 megs compared to 12.3 megs for V3.  It prints nicely without requiring any support.  The fan mount clears the diagonals nicely and the bushings fit well, too.\r
\r
I should have a V5 with linear slides and a raised hotend but can't promise when it will arrive.\r
\r
Enjoy!""" ;
