    okh:function """I like to play Magic: The Gathering, but I often find it hard to carry my decks around along with cards I want to trade or use outside of a deck. So I roughed out the idea to create a 3d printable deck holder to grip onto a standard 3 ring binder. This would then occupy the third (right-most) column of the card sheets that would be used to store extra cards. \r
\r
I mainly eyeballed a lot of this project, but the dimensions of the interior of the box should hold up to 60 cards in tournament sleeves. If you print 3 there should be enough room to fit all of them on one binder.\r
\r
I don't personally own a 3d printer, but I'm in the planning stages of a design based on the Rostock printers I've been seeing. However, since I haven't been able to test this myself, your mileage may vary when you print this.\r
\r
I also plan to upload a version that is much shorter for those of you who don't use card sleeves all the time.\r
