function = "This screen holder slides into the front of the TrinityOne base and holds the LCD screen firmly in place. I made it so I wouldn't have to hold the controller in one hand and operate the dial with the other. Plus, it prevents the metal contacts on the back from accidentally touching the metal base, since static electricity or shorting contacts can crash it, requiring a power cycle.\r\n\r\nThe slots at the top rear lock into the t-slots along the front of the printer, but you can still slide it out to the right if you need to remove the LCD.\r\n\r\nNote that the dial is a representation of a mÃ¶bius solid, like the TrinityLabs logo."
