I also opened up the 30 pin area as it was a bit snug. \r\n\r\nI have not built this version. I thickened the walls on the top back 2 corners as the thinner walls did not build properly but the dock is still functionally perfect. it should build ok now, though as I doubled the wall thickness from what I built last night"
