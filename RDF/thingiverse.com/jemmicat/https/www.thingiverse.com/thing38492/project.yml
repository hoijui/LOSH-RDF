function: "This is a modified version of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23339 (Thanks again for the STEP file inventworld)\r\n\r\n I modified it for using a Case-mate pop ID case (http://www.case-mate.com/iPhone-4-Cases/Case-Mate-iPhone-4-4S-Pop-ID-Cases.asp)\r\n\r\nI also modified it to use aftermarket 30 pin cable to fit the usb cable through the opening. I also opened up the 30 pin area as it was a bit snug. \r\n\r\nI have not built this version. I thickened the walls on the top back 2 corners as the thinner walls did not build properly but the dock is still functionally perfect. it should build ok now, though as I doubled the wall thickness from what I built last night"
