function: After killing his wife's lover ["Good evening, Major, my name is Muybridge and here is the answer to the letter you sent my wife"; he then killed the Major with a gunshot.] and subsequently being acquitted as a "justifiable homicide," Eadweard Muybridge was hired by Stanford to create photographic series of animals [and humans] in motion. These are eight bison, taken from a series of twenty-four photographs of a bison... lumbering. Or whatever it is that bison do.
