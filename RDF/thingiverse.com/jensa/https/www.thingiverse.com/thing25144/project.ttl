Very basic flute that I made for the kids after having problems with many other flute models. PS: it's kind of loud...  

Update: "flute08.stl" is the version I use the most these days. It has a tiny square break-away part that supports the overhang of the corner. Makes for prettier prints and less cleanup.""" ;
