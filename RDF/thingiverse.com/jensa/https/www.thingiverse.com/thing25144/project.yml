function: "This thing has moved to Youmagine https://www.youmagine.com/designs/simple-flute so I don't also get sued by Stratasys...  \n\nVery basic flute that I made for the kids after having problems with many other flute models. PS: it's kind of loud...  \n\nUpdate: \"flute08.stl\" is the version I use the most these days. It has a tiny square break-away part that supports the overhang of the corner. Makes for prettier prints and less cleanup."
