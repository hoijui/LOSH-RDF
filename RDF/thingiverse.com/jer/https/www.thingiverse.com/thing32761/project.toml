function = "This is a work in progress, but has been printed and tested.  This is a basic cooling fan attachment for a Replicator 1 with dual extrusion.  It attaches under the extruder heatsinks and fans, replacing the fan spacers.  It is designed to support a 40mm 24v cooling fan, similar to the stock replicator fans and blow air onto the extruding filament.\r\n\r\nWith the latest version, I've been getting very successful PLA prints."
