Lately, I've been stacking an 1/8" piece of borosilicate glass on top of my build platform for printing PLA, and using this clip prevents me from having to adjust the height of the limit switch itself.\r
\r
On my machine, it's a little on the tight side.  But it works well enough, and I'd rather it be too tight than too loose.  I've included the OpenSCAD source if anyone is inclined to fiddle with it.  There are variables for the thickness of your piece of glass, thickness of the wooden panel, etc...""" ;
