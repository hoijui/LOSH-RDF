function: "This is a set of replacement wedges used to position the baskets/shelves in those tall pole-style shower organizers.  The pole goes from the bath to the ceiling, and the shelves slide up and down it.  The shelves are kept in place using a pair of small plastic wedges that fit between the pole and the shelf.\r\n\r\nThis looks like the right sort of thing:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Better-Bath-Style-Rageous-Tension-Organizer/dp/B003JC05GK/ref=pd_sim_sbs_hg_57"
