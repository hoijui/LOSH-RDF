What is OmNomNom Creator?  \r
\r
It is a lightweight easy to use software tool to change 2D Images into 3D objects.  \r
\r
Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEFzczYCRu4\r
\r
\r
You can use it to create 3D Cookie Cutters, Medallions, Logos, Surface Maps, Mazes, QR Codes, Stamps, or for anything where you need to get a 2D image into a 3D project.\r
\r
Very simple to use, just drag and drop any common image format (gif, jpg, png, tiff etc.) into OmNomNom.\r
\r
Choose the output format you want, and it will launch OpenScad containing a template of your 3D object.\r
\r
If you don't use OpenScad, don't worry, the work has been done for you, just create the .stl and print.   Changing sizes and dimensions is a breeze.\r
\r
You can also create your own templates (please post your templates on Thingiverse).\r
\r
** If OpenSCAD crashes or is slow exporting your models, try the development snapshot of OpenSCAD, I found it worked better **\r
\r
Compatibility:  Mac OS X 10.7 or later (Lion or later)\r
Requirement: OpenSCAD 2011.12 or later\r
Printing: All objects printed on a ToM with single extruder using Jetty Accelerated Firmware and Pause@ZPos""" ;
