function: "Request: Because this isn't a printable item, if you build something using this tool, please take the time to make it a derivative, click on \"I Made One\", or reference this thing in your description.  Thanks!\r\n\r\nWhat is OmNomNom Creator?  \r\n\r\nIt is a lightweight easy to use software tool to change 2D Images into 3D objects.  \r\n\r\nVideo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEFzczYCRu4\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use it to create 3D Cookie Cutters, Medallions, Logos, Surface Maps, Mazes, QR Codes, Stamps, or for anything where you need to get a 2D image into a 3D project.\r\n\r\nVery simple to use, just drag and drop any common image format (gif, jpg, png, tiff etc.) into OmNomNom.\r\n\r\nChoose the output format you want, and it will launch OpenScad containing a template of your 3D object.\r\n\r\nIf you don't use OpenScad, don't worry, the work has been done for you, just create the .stl and print.   Changing sizes and dimensions is a breeze.\r\n\r\nYou can also create your own templates (please post your templates on Thingiverse).\r\n\r\n** If OpenSCAD crashes or is slow exporting your models, try the development snapshot of OpenSCAD, I found it worked better **\r\n\r\nCompatibility:  Mac OS X 10.7 or later (Lion or later)\r\nRequirement: OpenSCAD 2011.12 or later\r\nPrinting: All objects printed on a ToM with single extruder using Jetty Accelerated Firmware and Pause@ZPos"
