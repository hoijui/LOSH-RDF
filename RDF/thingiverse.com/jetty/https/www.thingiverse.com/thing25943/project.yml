function: "These are some basic acceleration tests we were using whilst developing the acceleration firmware.\r\n\r\nAll are parametric.\r\n\r\nWe were also commonly using the squirrel and owl that can be found on Thingiverse.\r\n\r\n10mm Calibration Cube - Quick to print thin cube (used to adjust fill during acceleration)\r\n\r\nCalibration Cone - Used to check print quality versus speed and ringing\r\n\r\nCalibration Cylinder - Used to check ringing and small movements\r\n\r\nSkipTest - Used to check filament skipping in acute angles"
