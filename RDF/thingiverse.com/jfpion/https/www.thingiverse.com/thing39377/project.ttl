the first try I've made to design an all in one box was ugly and too big to fit in the pocket.\r
\r
I finally design this one for my Philips GoGear only slighty bigger than the reader itself.\r
\r
Still need some work to smooth the edges and round the corners.\r

could be adapted fot a lot of different mp3 reader/ipod.....""" ;
