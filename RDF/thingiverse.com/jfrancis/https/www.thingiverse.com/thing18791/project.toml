function = "This is an adapter for mounting your phone to a 3.6cm (1.42 in) outer diameter telescope eyepiece. It works very well with most common eyepieces greatly simplifying the astrophotography process.  Enjoy!   \n\nI've seen a good way to use this: just buy or print a cheap case for your phone and then super glue this adapter to the case. Keep the case with your astronomy stuff.  \n\nFor webcam users:   \n\nhttp://webcamastronomy.com/index.html  \n\nI recommend using microsoft amcap to capture video and then use registax to automatically stack images from that video. It's really that easy"
