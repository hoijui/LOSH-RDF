function: This is just a simple cart for storing material that is 24" by 48" I made this because I needed a cart for my cnc mill that has a 24 x 48 bed. The materials that I had for it where leaned up against a wall and that was unsightly, so I designed and made this cart. concept to cradle was less than 24 hours.
