function: 'I have been interested in all of the multicolor projects being posted lately. Rather than trying to join different color filaments or utilize sharpies, I have gone with an "old-school" approach from the model car kits I assembled as a kid.  I printed out the different colors as different parts. Not much rocket science here.  Cupcake CNC #806 still produces a low res, pixilated version of the real thing (also shown in the picts at left).'
