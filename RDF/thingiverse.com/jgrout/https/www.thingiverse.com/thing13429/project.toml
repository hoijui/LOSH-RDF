function = "This device hangs from the top of your iPad to increase the speaker's volume.  It is not a cone shaped megaphone like its forebearers.  Rather, it is just curved to bounce most of the sound to the front of the iPad.  The sound volume and quality increase are noticeable.\r\n\r\nIt is a first attempt and I'm sure the Thingiverse community can make it much better.\r\n\r\nThe photo also shows the \"Simple iPad Stand -3D\" (thing:4020) by eagleapex in use."
