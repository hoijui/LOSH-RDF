function: "Steve Colbert said that the Makerbot will allow us to avoid importing  \"cheap chinese crap.\" What is really cool about the Makerbot is that it makes the exact crap that you want.  \r\n\r\nI was tired of having my + shaped lug wrench sliding around in the bed of my pickup truck.  I also did not want to use up space in the cab for it.  So I designed this holder that clips on the rim of the bed right behind the cab. Custom crap."
