function: "This is a bracket I derived from Cursedmagician's very cool clip-on fan bracket.  I found that the semi-enclosed frame of the LC x-carriage blocked a lot of flow, so I added a second fan mount so the air would pass around the hot end better.  It's a bit of overkill perhaps, but it seems to work for me.\r\n\r\nA future version might have a downward angle to the fans so they are pointed more at the nozzle."
