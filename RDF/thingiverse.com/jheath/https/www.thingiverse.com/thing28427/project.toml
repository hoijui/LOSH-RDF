function = "I regularly buy crickets to feed to my White's Tree Frog. The other day I thought it'd be fun to serve up their last meal in style with this little food and water bowl combo. Crickets drown fairly easily so I made the bowl small enough to easily climb out of. Yes, bottle caps could be used to hold food and water but that just wouldn't be as much fun!"
