function: "In honor of the art&&code kinect hacking conference, I'm happy to release my first design ever: a kinect stand that lets you mount your kinect to your laptop display. I created it in OpenSCAD so you can play with the parameters for wall thickness, arm height, etc.\r\n\r\nThis barely fits on my cupcake's build platform but it does work. People with larger build platforms might want to increase the wall thickness to give it a bit more strength.\r\n\r\nWARNING: Some laptop hinges might not be strong enough to support the weight of the kinect. On my macbook pro I was able to hold it as long as I didn't tilt the monitor beyond 95\xC2\xB0 or so. Be careful!"
