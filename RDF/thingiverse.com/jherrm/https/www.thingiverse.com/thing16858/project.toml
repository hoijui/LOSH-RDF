function = "Storage cabinets are great for organizing small parts. Unfortunately the one I recently bought from Lowes didn't come with drawer dividers, so I fired up OpenSCAD and made my own.\r\n\r\nThe script is fully parameterized so you can customize it to fit whatever drawers are out there. The default values fit the smaller drawers on a Shop Stack-On 39-Drawer Storage Cabinet ( http://www.lowes.com/pd_124553-941-DSB-39_ )\r\n\r\nFor updates, check out the code on github: https://github.com/jherrm/Drawer-Divider\r\n\r\nFor more info, see this post: http://jherrman.com/2012/02/3d-printed-drawer-dividers/"
