function: This is an egg tangram puzzle, often called the Magic Egg. The nine pieces can be reassembled to create numerous shapes - most popular ones are birds! The resource can be printed out and children challenged to create the images. The process of piecing together the individual shapes supports the children's logical thinking, reasoning, and visual problem-solving skills.
