function: "I have some sheet-rock to hang and I always have trouble locating the electrical boxes after I have put the sheet-rock over the top of it. I thought that this target system would be an easier way of locating the electrical boxes once the sheet rock is placed over them.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a magnetic target designed to fit inside the electrical box and a magnetic face-plate that aligns with it through the sheet-rock. The face-plate is sized to the opening that is needed to be cut - making it easy to accurately cut the opening."
