function: "It's a bit corny, but I thought it was a neat metaphor. Using the 5 love languages as chess pieces to capture the king which is the heart.  \r\nKing - Heart\r\nQueen - Quality Time\r\nRook - Receiving Gifts\r\nBishop - Acts of Service (this was really difficult)\r\nKnight - Touch\r\nPawn - Words of affirmation. I was going to make multiple words on different pawns but the rules specified 6 pieces."
