function: "I loved the Pet monster Valentine from Andreas but I was not able to print it. Then he created the little dragon without accessories and I could (and did) print that. However, Valentine should guard (or hoard?) a treasure.\r\n\r\nSo I created a Treasure Mountain where you can put your own 'treasure'in and where you can put the little dragon on top to guard it.\r\n\r\nI started with the base of Andreas, added a 'well' in it, in which the dragon can rest, and put it on top of  hollowed out mountain."
