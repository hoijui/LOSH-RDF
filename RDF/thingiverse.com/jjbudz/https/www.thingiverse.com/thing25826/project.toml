function = "Doesn't everyone need to design a phone case or phone/tablet stand when they get their shiny new 3d printer? Here's the one I created for my iPad to use at the breakfast table while catching up on the news. In essence, it is a vertical reading stand for tablets and e-readers. The basic design is for the iPad2 &3 without their covers on. Other designs are described in the instructions and can be used with all iPads with/without their covers attached."
