function: "I initially wanted to buy a 3d printer but was not happy with the size so i decided to create and build my own design based on the best of what was out there.\r\n This is a large 3d printer with a print area or build size of approximatly 22\" x 16\" x 15\"or 560mm x 410 x 380mm.\r\nIt uses Makerslide linear bearing system http://www.makerslide.com/ for the x, y and z axis.\r\nIt is a derivative of the Mendelmax and the Quantum Ordbot.\r\n  I am currently building a prototype.\r\n  The build is scalable and it is easy to expand the model just like its predecessor the Mendelmax. \r\n send me an email on jjimmijj@tpg.com.au\r\n\r\nFEATURES: \r\nLarge build area 22\" x 16\" x 15\"or 560mm x 410 x 380mm\r\nAluminium extrusion frame\r\nMakerslide linear V/ rail x,y & z axes\r\nAdjustable belts\r\n12mm threaded rod\r\nEasy assembly\r\nScaleable\r\nSolid build\r\nNo extruding parts\r\nSelf replicating Reprap\r\n\r\nI have utilised several ideas from thingiverse in this build and would like to thank the following for their ideas and inspiration....\r\n\r\n Mendelmax by Kludgineer \r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12645\r\nOrd Bot by bdring\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=ord+bot\r\nMendelMax - Adjustable foot - round by NM-Buzzard\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15880\r\nDual Makerslide y-axis by simonious http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15884\r\nSpool Holder by kludgineer\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13329\r\nprusa y-axis belt tensioner by chrille\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10274"
