function: "What we have here is a lunch box sized case for your Raspberry Pi project.  I intended this to be a housing for a RaspBMC media center, but it would work equally well for almost any project.  If you've worked with the Raspberry Pi then you've probably been frustrated with the lack of a power button and the tangle of wire from the various connectors on all sides of the board.  I wanted a nice and neat box to house my project that would look clean and finished.  Here is what I've come up with.\r\n\r\nThis is an active work in progress - so any ideas, complaints, or questions are always welcome."
