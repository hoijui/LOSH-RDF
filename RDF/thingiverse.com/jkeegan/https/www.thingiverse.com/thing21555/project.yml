function: "To celebrate the release of another song from the upcoming Rush album Clockwork Angels two days from now, I decided to model the clock shown in the teaser trailer (see links below).  This is the outer ring that you could mount on a CD-sized clock.\r\n\r\nI designed it in Google Sketchup, and made a mistake that I eventually decided I like, so I'm sticking with it - instead of the base being solid as originally designed, slicing subtracted the symbols from the base. The result is that the bottom of the base has a negative of the symbols, and then the symbols are still printed on top. I actually like it.\r\n\r\nMine was printed with clear PLA so you can't really make out the symbols that well without good lighting, but hopefully it looks better printed with an opaque plastic.\r\n\r\nSadly I am in no way connected with Rush - I'm just an insanely devoted fan.  :)\r\n\r\nteaser trailer:\r\nhttp://bcove.me/hwp437l4\r\n\r\ndifferent youtube link:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK9PTQzopCA\r\n\r\nUpdate: Now that the song is out, here's the official lyrics video:\r\n\r\nRUSH - \"Headlong Flight\" - Official Lyric Video \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcFGrWjOX0E"
