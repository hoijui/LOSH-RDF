function: "There are several printable polyhedral dice on Thingiverse, but the only full set: \r\n\r\nthingiverse.com/thing:30421\r\n\r\nHas very rounded corners that I'm not fond of, since they take too long to stop rolling and don't have the nostalgia value of sharp edged dice for me. \r\n\r\nMost of the sharp edged dice on Thingiverse don't have the numbers engraved and are really just platonic solids or use non-standard designs.\r\n\r\nThere already is a sharp D12: thingiverse.com/thing:550\r\n\r\nAnd a really nice sharp-edged D20: thingiverse.com/thing:551\r\n\r\nAs well as an almost sharp D10: thingiverse.com/thing:3018\r\n\r\nI previously uploaded a sharp-edged D4: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33293\r\n\r\nI want to fill in the missing dice so that there's a full set of sharp-edged, old-school polyhedral dice on Thingiverse. This is my second contribution, the classic polyhedral sharp-edged D6\r\n\r\nI place no restrictions on the use of this file or the original Blender file (attached, use 2.64+)."
