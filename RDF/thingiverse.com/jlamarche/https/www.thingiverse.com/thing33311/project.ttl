\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30421\r
\r
Has very rounded corners that I'm not fond of, since they take too long to stop rolling and don't have the nostalgia value of sharp edged dice for me. \r
\r
Most of the sharp edged dice on Thingiverse don't have the numbers engraved and are really just platonic solids or use non-standard designs.\r
\r
There already is a sharp D12: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:550\r
\r
And a really nice sharp-edged D20: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:551\r
\r
As well as an almost sharp D10: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3018\r
\r
You can find my first die, the D4 here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33293\r
\r
You can find my second die, the D6, here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33307\r
\r
I want to fill in the missing dice so that there's a full set of sharp-edged, old-school polyhedral dice on Thingiverse. This is my third contribution, the D8.\r
\r
I place no restrictions on the use of this file or the original Blender file (attached, use 2.64+).""" ;
