function = "There are several printable polyhedral dice on Thingiverse, but the only full set: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30421\r\n\r\nHas very rounded corners that I'm not fond of, since they take too long to stop rolling and don't have the nostalgia value of sharp edged dice for me. \r\n\r\nMost of the sharp edged dice on Thingiverse don't have the numbers engraved and are really just platonic solids or use non-standard designs.\r\n\r\nThere already is a sharp D12: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:550\r\n\r\nAnd a really nice sharp-edged D20: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:551\r\n\r\nAs well as an almost sharp D10: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3018\r\n\r\nYou can find my first die, the D4 here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33293\r\n\r\nYou can find my second die, the D6, here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33307\r\n\r\nThe third die I created, the D8, is here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33311/edit\r\n\r\nI want to fill in the missing dice so that there's a full set of sharp-edged, old-school polyhedral dice on Thingiverse. This is my fourth contribution, the D12.\r\n\r\nWith this, there is now a full set of sharp-edged polyhedral gaming dice on Thingiverse. I may go ahead and do the d10 and D20 so that there's a full set with a consistent look, though.\r\n\r\nI place no restrictions on the use of this file or the original Blender file (attached, use 2.64+)."
