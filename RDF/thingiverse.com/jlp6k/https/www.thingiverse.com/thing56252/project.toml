function = "Yet another spool holder!\r\n\r\nI failed several printings because the filament was not fed properly. So I decided to build my own parametric spool holder.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to print 4 parts and to provide 2 nuts, 2 bearings and a length of threaded rod. I used M8 screws and skate bearings but you can choose your own as the design is parametric."
