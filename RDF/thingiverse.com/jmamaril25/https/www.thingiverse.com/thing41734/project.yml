function: This is the phone I had and my case broke so I thought I would attempt to make a case for it. I haven't printed it yet, but I thought if anyone wanted to try it. This was the first thing I have made and uploaded so I apologize if it is a really bad print. If you have any revision ideas either upload them or let me know! I am sort of a beginner so I can try to figure out how to do it!
