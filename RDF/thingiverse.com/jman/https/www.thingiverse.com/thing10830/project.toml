function = "Electronic project boxes always seem to be the wrong size, and it always seems harder than necessary to fit PCBs. This box is something I always wanted!\r\nYou can set the outside dimensions, wall thickness, up to three levels of PCB support, up to 2 pairs of screws and specify apertures in the top and one end.\r\nApertures are useful for button or switch access, LCD views, cables or LEDs.\r\nBecause the end of the box is open, maximum access is available, and both the PCBs and the Lid can slide in together.\r\nThe box has rounded side edges, which feel nice in the hand.\r\n\r\nUpdated to V1.1 21st August 2011, for better accuracy in larger wall thicknesses.\r\n\r\nUpdated to v1.2.
