    okh:function """I needed a way of holding a camera in a stable position for desktop photographing of various small items. A desktop tripod was not really working for me, so I designed this gantry (a bit derived from a traveling crane!)\r
The camera can be held at a wide variety of orientations and heights, and then easily locked in place by tightening the knobs at either end. The whole thing collapses down flat to go in a cupboard.\r
The non-plastic parts are four 12mm by 400mmm aluminium tubes, with caps on to avoid scratching and slippage, a piece of thick plywood 50mm by 350mm (in my case with some aluminium angle along the edges for reinforcement), two M6 * 65mm hex bolts with washers and nuts, four M4 * 25mm bolts with washers and nuts, and some foam for under the camera.""" ;
