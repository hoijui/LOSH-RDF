This design is totally scalable, and the STL I've uploaded is about as big as you can print on a ToM. It's big enough for my RAMPS electronics enclosure.\r
As you can see in the image I've drilled a couple of holes to mount stuff. It is really up to you how (or what) you attach.\r
There is an option to print this for the left hand side, or the right. I've uploaded the LHS version because that is the end with the X-axis motor. You obviously could have both!""" ;
