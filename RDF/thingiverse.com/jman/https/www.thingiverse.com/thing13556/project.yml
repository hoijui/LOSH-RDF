function: "I was going to use a piece of ply or MDF, but then I thought a matching part printed in PLA would be a good way to mount my electronics on the Mendel I'm making.\r\nThis design is totally scalable, and the STL I've uploaded is about as big as you can print on a ToM. It's big enough for my RAMPS electronics enclosure.\r\nAs you can see in the image I've drilled a couple of holes to mount stuff. It is really up to you how (or what) you attach.\r\nThere is an option to print this for the left hand side, or the right. I've uploaded the LHS version because that is the end with the X-axis motor. You obviously could have both!"
