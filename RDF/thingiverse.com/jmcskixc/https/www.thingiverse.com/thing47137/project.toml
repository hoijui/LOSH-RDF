function = "V2 update: The phone didn't fit as well as I wanted, so I've tuned up the demensions a bit for V2.  The width is narrower by .100\" and I reworked some of the fillets.  Also enlarged the radius for the stem area to 1.5\".\r\n\r\nI created this part to easily mount my phone on the stem of my road bike.  I use it on the stationary trainer to easily listen to music while pedaling.  This way I can crank tunes to keep my energy up without disturbing anybody.\r\n\r\nThe cut-out to fit over the bike stem is a 1.5\" radius.  This would probably work on most stems and top tubes that are around an inch to two inches, with the use of a little padding to help a poor fit.\r\n\r\nIf the fit is loose or slides easily on the frame mount or around the phone, you could try cutting a piece of old inner tube to stick in between for a better fit without having to modify the design at all or having to reprint it.\r\n\r\nMy phone has the Seidio two-layer case (the one with the silicone glove plus the hard plastic outer shell), so the other standard Nexus S designs would never have enough room for it.  This one should.\r\nIf you wanted to use it on the road or trail, it might (meaning definitely) need some better clamping mechanism on the phone.  This design is for stationary applications.\r\n\r\nThe pegs are to keep the zip ties separate to the mount won't flop around too much as you pedal, or move the bike on and off the trainer, etc.\r\n\r\nYou could probably use it with some rubber bands to temporarily mount your phone to almost anything, like other gym equipment or something in your car or truck.\r\n\r\nJust zip-tie the thing to some part of your bike, and stick your phone in it.  Happy pedaling!"
