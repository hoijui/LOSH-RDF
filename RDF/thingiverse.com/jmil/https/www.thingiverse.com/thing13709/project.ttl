    okh:function """I've taken Renosis' awesome Gangsta chess set and put all pieces on one build plate (hexagonal packing). There are 8 pawns, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 2 knights, and a king. I've also added in 2 queens (the second one is for when your first pawn makes it to the other side!) and 3 extra gangstas, just for, you know, more awesome.\r
\r
There are two STLs... decide which you want to print:\r
the 1" feet file has 1" diameter feet on each piece\r
the 1.6" feet file is the original sized pieces and the larger ones are 1.6" diameter on their feet.\r
\r
Choose the appropriate size for your chess board, or scale it as desired.\r
\r
I've also included the Blender .blend file I used to make the rendering using the new Cycles rendering engine in case you would like to do your own renderings or learn more about Blender. Highly recommended.""" ;
