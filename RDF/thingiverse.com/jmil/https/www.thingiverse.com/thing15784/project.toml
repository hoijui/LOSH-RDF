function = "The original model from cyclone is totally awesome, but it's only the right hand. So I mirrored the hand in Blender. Now you've got a complete set. A-okay for us lefties.\r\n\r\nGrab the left-hand-only version if you've already printed the right hand and want a match.\r\n\r\nThey make great bookends and a great pairing with Yoda (see the pic... hiding he is.)."
