The hope would be to make starch plastic/glass like this:\r\nhttp://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/374-Cooking-molding-bioplastics-at-home-recipes%2C-results-tips.html\r\n\r\nand then use the glue gun on MakerBot to do the extrusion. We are also testing other materials to extrude. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nThis is the first version of the glue gun support. Each side takes about 3 hours to print. Screw together with M3 bolts you have leftover from your CupCake CNC. The wings fit over the z-axis bolts to mount directly in your CupCake CNC.\r\n\r\nA way to automate glue gun extrusion is in progress and even more experimental than this glue gun holder..."
