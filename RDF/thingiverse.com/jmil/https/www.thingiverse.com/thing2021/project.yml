We are also testing other materials to extrude. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nThis is the first version of the glue gun support. Each side takes about 3 hours to print. Screw together with M3 bolts you have leftover from your CupCake CNC. The wings fit over the z-axis bolts to mount directly in your CupCake CNC.\r\n\r\nA way to automate glue gun extrusion is in progress and even more experimental than this glue gun holder..."
