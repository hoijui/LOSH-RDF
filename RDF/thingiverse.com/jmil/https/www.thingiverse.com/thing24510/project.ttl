    okh:function """MendelMax and Aluminum Extrusions are awesome to work with. This Y-rod holder is inspired by the ziptie-less LM8UU holders by Jonas Kuehling while also being compatible with MendelMax.\r
\r
MendelMax v1 had Y-rod holders that spanned two extrusions. v1.5 has a lasercut piece to attach to the center of one extrusion. I like this design but I wanted more play in the length of y-rods that could be used (so I could recycle some from previous bots) and also I wanted a 3D printable version because I can't use wood in my designs (for bioengineering stuff).\r
\r
Designed in Blender because my OpenSCAD-fu is not very good. .blend file is attached.""" ;
