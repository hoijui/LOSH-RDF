function = "Introducing the Baricuda Extruder for 3D Printing Sugar and Chocolate\r\n\r\nDerived from the venerable MakerBot MK2 Frostruder, this air-pressure driven extruder (\"baric\") is a *U*niversal extruder because it adds a *D*egree *A*mplifier (yep... temperature) to let you extrude anything.\r\n\r\nThe Source Code and Files are Hosted on Github:\r\nhttp://www.github.com/jmil/BariCUDA\r\n\r\nWe used this to precisely extruder sugar templates for engineering vascular tissues for regenerative medicine research. See the details here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VHFlwJQIkE\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use it for:\r\n1) Molten Sugar Extrusion\r\n2) Molten Chocolate Extrusion\r\n3) Molten PLA and ABS and other experimental plastics Extrusion\r\n3) Molten  Extrusion -- This is a *U*niversal Extruder! Any thermoplastic material can be extruded.\r\n\r\nYou are only limited by your motherboard and the number of MOSFETs you have (for control of pneumatics just like the Frostruder).\r\n\r\nOperation is IDENTICAL to the Frostruder, you just need to add a heating element and thermistor for temperature measurement."
