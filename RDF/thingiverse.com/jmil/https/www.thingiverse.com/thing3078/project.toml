function = "This is a derivative of Bre's Blender Monkey:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:895\r\n\r\nThe model is a free and open model that comes with Blender (the Blender Foundation has affectionately nicknamed the monkey Suzanne). I wanted to print it, but it could use finer detail and it also has tons of overhangs which are not good for MakerBot just yet. So I modified the design in Blender with SubSurf modifier (setting of 3 to make it much smoother), exported to stl, and then printed the model with symmetry in mind -- print exactly one half of the head, flip one of your axes to print it's mirror image, then glue or epoxy them together."
