function = "This is my second lasercut project, after a few shadowpuppets I produced.\r\n\r\nA cardboard wine rack.  Holes are 3.5\" in diameter -- too small for Magnums, but about right for a standard 750mL bottle.  As an added bonus, a variety of stars and coasters are cut out of the waste cardboard.\r\n\r\nInspired by robyward's Assymetric Wine Rack http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4965 -- but I modified the design to fit the limitations of my 12x24 build materials.\r\n\r\nTODO for version 2:\r\n - make the holes bigger.  3.6\" would allow some larger bottles to fit.\r\n - ditch the side holes, they aren't secure enough for bottles.\r\n - make the struts wider."
