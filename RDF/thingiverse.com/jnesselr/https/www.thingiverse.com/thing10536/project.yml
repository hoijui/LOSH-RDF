function: "This is actually a test object for the disk shooter contest.  I don't have a 3d printer, and was wondering about a few different things to see how well they print.  This actually consists of 3 pieces that are put together.  This was designed for 19 mm by 2 mm disks.  The disks.stl file just contains 16 disks that should be the right size.  I tried to give a little space around objects, so I definitely want to know how that works out when printed.  I also designed the bottom and top to interlock together.  They won't snap together, so much as fit together with tabs and slots.\r\n\r\nIf you print this for me, I'd be very very happy! I also want to know the design flaws of this.  This is a WIP because I'm trying to make it have a cartridge to hold the disks.\r\n\r\nThere are two modifiable variables in the OpenSCAD document.  \"l\" (lowercase L) is the length of the disk shooter.  It is currently set at 100 for 100mm.\r\n\"num\" is the number of tabs used to put the bottom and top pieces together.  Really, all that does is define the spacing for it, as some tabs aren't fully there because of the hole in the top piece to load the shooter.  The default is 10, but in this case, only 8 are technically visible.  Also, the minimum working number is 1, the maximum is 20.\r\n\r\nPlease post pictures and give tips if you print this, or if you just know how to use openSCAD better than I do.  Thank you!"
