    okh:function """I wanted a nice looking, enclosed and reliable 3D printer with great build quality and large envelope. The result: Part-Y!\r
\r
The frame consists of L-shaped aluminium profiles, covered in clear plexiglass with vinyldecals designed by my sister. The printer is completely enclosed with charcoal filters on the air outlet to get rid of fumes.\r
\r
All axes are constructed with high quality professional linear guides. The z axis was originally designed with rods and linear bearings, but I bought the cheapest bearings on ebay and the quality was really bad.\r
\r
The extruder is a Makerbot mk7 for 1.75mm filament, choosen for it's compact size, high reliability and great precision.\r
\r
Current build envelope is limited by the area of the heated bed to 210x210x200 mm, the x and y axes are however capable of 240mm movement.\r
\r
Print-Y is controlled by a Sanguinololu and powered by an internal 400W PSU.\r
\r
I'll add more details with BOM aso later if someone is interested.\r
