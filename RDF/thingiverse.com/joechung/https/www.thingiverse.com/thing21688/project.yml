function: "This is a simpler version of the Makerbot Filament Spool that is only set up for mounting vertically on top of the makerbot. This version doesn't try to grip the whole spool - it's just long enough to hold the spool securely.\r\n\r\nOptionally I've added a ball bearing filament guide, mainly because I had an extra 623 bearing from making my \"Even more minimal MK7 extruder bearing filament feeder\"\r\n\r\nThere's also a non-bearing version of the guide which I haven't tried, but should work totally fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nNet-net is the silky smoothest filament feeding system in the Thingiverse ;)"
