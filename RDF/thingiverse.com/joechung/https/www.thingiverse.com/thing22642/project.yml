function: I keep losing those little straws that come with WD40 and other aerosol lubricants because they come taped to the can but then it either slips out of the tape later or it gets eaten by a gremlin, etc...  So I figured this was a job for my makerbot. Got this more or less right the second print, and voila - now my straw has a place to go after use!
