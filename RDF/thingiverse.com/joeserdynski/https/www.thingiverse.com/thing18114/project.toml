function = "Specialty Molds for One-Off Urethane Parts.  Made with PLA so parts can be demolded by dissolving the PLA.  PLA wall thickness prevents sagging from the heat generated by the Urethane (180degF).  Also making PLA molds to make Silicone Molds for more than one Urethane part.  Silicone cures at room temperature and molds for molds can be thin walled.  PLA dissolving makes life very easy and complex designs can be made."
