A coworker saw something similar in one of those 'crazy product designs from Japan' articles. She asked if I could print her one based solely on the low res photo she showed me. \r
\r
It's a fairly simple design so I quickly drew the 2D outline in Illustrator then proceeded to use a very convoluted process to ultimately get it into OpenSCAD using a number of techniques I'm still learning. \r
\r
I'm sure there is a much easier method to build the model so please feel free to share any tips.\r

UPDATE: Of course after I post this, I discover that it's not the first...not having any terminology to go by, I was looking for the wrong thing. Looks like this was here first: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1120 and this is newer and closer to my design: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1747""" ;
