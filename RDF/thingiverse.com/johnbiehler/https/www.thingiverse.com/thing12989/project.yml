function: "A device for holding open the pages in big books with your thumb while you read them.\r\n\r\nA coworker saw something similar in one of those 'crazy product designs from Japan' articles. She asked if I could print her one based solely on the low res photo she showed me. \r\n\r\nIt's a fairly simple design so I quickly drew the 2D outline in Illustrator then proceeded to use a very convoluted process to ultimately get it into OpenSCAD using a number of techniques I'm still learning. \r\n\r\nI'm sure there is a much easier method to build the model so please feel free to share any tips.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Of course after I post this, I discover that it's not the first...not having any terminology to go by, I was looking for the wrong thing. Looks like this was here first: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1120 and this is newer and closer to my design: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1747"
