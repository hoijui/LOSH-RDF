function = "I wanted a mount to hold the SparkFun Bluetooth Mate Silver modem that I'll be using on my RepRap Prusa Mendel thanks to this:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13506\r\n\r\nI edited the OpenSCAD file for the Arduino module and adjusted it to fit the modem. I also removed the extra tabs (originally there were 6). \r\n\r\nThis should also fit the BlueSMiRF modules as well.\r\n\r\nI set the length to be 40mm so that I'd have a little room at the end for solder points. \r\n\r\nThis is a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5396 as well."
