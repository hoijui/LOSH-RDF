function: "Using the excellent Tinkercad file by Physics Dude that this thing is derived from, it seemed like the perfect platform to attach a webcam to. \r\n\r\nI simply erased the unnecessary tool holder parts and put a tripod mount hole in the middle. \r\n\r\nI also made a larger platform that can move the camera further away from the print area if your webcam requires that or so you have a bigger surface to clamp just about anything onto.\r\n\r\nI have a Microsoft LifeCam that has a tripod mount point and used the mounting screw from a gorillapod that I normally use to shoot timelapses or simply remotely monitor the printer with.\r\n\r\nFeel free to adjust as necessary by making a copy in Tinkercad:\r\n\r\nSmall: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc06bf989380100/53\r\nBig: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc0eb3a3fe504be/19"
