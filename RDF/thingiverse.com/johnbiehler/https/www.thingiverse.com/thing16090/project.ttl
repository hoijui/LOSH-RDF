\r
In any case, I changed the bushing type in configuration.SCAD and regenerated the STL for the idler and it appears to work now as I was able to snap in the LM8UUs.\r
\r
It's worth noting though that the LM8UUs I have  (from Mixshop.ca) are shorter than the normal ones which may or may not make a difference.\r
\r
Anyways, I've included the updated SCAD files just in case anyone else runs into a similar issue.""" ;
