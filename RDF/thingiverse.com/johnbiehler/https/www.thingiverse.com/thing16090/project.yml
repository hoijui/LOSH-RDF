function: "I printed the original version by DXBLouie but found I couldn't get my LM8UUs into the channel on the idler. I downloaded the SCAD files and *think* the problem was that the original configuration.SCAD file was set to the wrong bushing type.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I changed the bushing type in configuration.SCAD and regenerated the STL for the idler and it appears to work now as I was able to snap in the LM8UUs.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting though that the LM8UUs I have  (from Mixshop.ca) are shorter than the normal ones which may or may not make a difference.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I've included the updated SCAD files just in case anyone else runs into a similar issue."
