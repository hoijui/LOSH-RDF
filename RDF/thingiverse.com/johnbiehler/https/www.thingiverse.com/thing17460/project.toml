function = "Wanted a cover to protect the top of the Gen 4 Interface Kit since it has the exposed ribbon cable wiring.\r\n\r\nThis is the first version I attempted...gravity holds it in place and it's not level due to the acrylic plate angle. \r\n\r\nV2: wider top (covers the wood) and more of a cap than a cover\r\n\r\nPrint whichever one you prefer.\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad. \r\n\r\nEdit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/things/9r2sBLXVxv8\r\n\r\nV2: https://tinkercad.com/things/5U7Wjh98Hsm"
