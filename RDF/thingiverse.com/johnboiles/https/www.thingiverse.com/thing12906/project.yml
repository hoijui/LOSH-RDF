function: I moved and rotated tomlombardi's design to get it to build on an Automated Build Platform. I was having issues where the extruder was running into the right center screw on the ABP. I also had to rotate counter-clockwise 90 degrees, so that the platform didn't collide with the front right corner of the makerbot while making the handle.
