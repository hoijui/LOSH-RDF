    okh:function """Sam Cohn was an exuberant boy with a 1000 watt smile. He loved his friends, family, dog, and bird deeply. Sam was passionate about guitar, snowboarding, lacrosse, and having fun.   



Sam was born on May 28, 1992. He was hit by a car on November 20, 2006 in Florida while visiting friends. His beautiful body stayed strong long enough for organ donation. He gave his heart, liver, kidney, and kidney-pancreas so that four others would live. His spirit continues on through them and surrounds us today. Sam lived his life to its fullest on this planet.  



t is hard to capture Sam's true spirit in a few paragraphs. He taught us so much. Mostly he taught us to have fun, ease up, and to be there for each other. He is a true best friend to many and deeply missed.  



SamStones are made with love. They are small fired clay rocks that have Sam's name and our website on them.  You can read about them at http://samstones.org.  

We make these stones by hand in community gatherings where we all come togetrher to have fun  and to heal. We give the stones out to anyone who wants them and invite them to keep them, pass them on or place them in a special place. We hope tht anyone who finds a SamStone picks up a little of Sam's joyous spirit . We also hope they find their way to theis website where thhye can tell us about where they found the stone and/or where they placed it.  

If you want a few SamStones for yourself, you can request them here.  

If you found a SamStone. or have a SamStone story, please let us know about it.""" ;
