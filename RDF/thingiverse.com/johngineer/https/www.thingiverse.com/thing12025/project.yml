function: "\"Tea, Earl Grey, Hot!\"\r\n\r\nThis is a replica of Jean-Luc Picard's teacup from Star Trek: The Next Generation. I based the model on images found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.trekprops.de/picards-tea-cup\r\n\r\nWe still have a ways to go before we can instantly replicate hot cups of tea, but you've got to start somewhere, right?\r\n\r\nRegarding images: if someone wants to make a rendering of this thing with a glass cup and black plastic handle, that would be awesome.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I'm uploading this as a prop only, not as an actual drinking vessel. Do not drink stuff out of it!"
