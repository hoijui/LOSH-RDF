    okh:function """Here's my Processing sketch to interface with the Kinect and capture the depth data and render it as a solid STL file. I've included controls to adjust two thresholds - near and far. This allows you to set up a "Han Solo in carbonite" type effect. \r
\r
I am not going to hold your hand through setting up Processing and this write up is In Progress, so if you get frustrated, realize that this might not be for you yet. Until I find a way to streamline posting a standalone application that works (currently it doesn't), this is still only for the persistent.\r
\r
 Until Microsoft publishes the code for their KinectFusion project, this is the best I could do to get a directly printable object without messing around in Blender or MeshLab. It's also my first serious coding effort, so forgive any inelegant code. Yes, the STL files are large (15mb) and the detail is hard for the CupCake to print, but it has the outreach potential for people new to 3D printers to create a unique, personalized object by just posing. Before you ask, the STL doesn't seem to take any less time in skeinforge if you use Blender to remove all duplicate vertices first, so I don't bother.""" ;
