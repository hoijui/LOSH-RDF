The tripod section is a modified version of the one designed by Brianorca - thingiverse.com/thing:5087 . The dimensions are a little different and it doesn't include the hole for bolting onto the bottom of a camera as it's not needed for the GoPro. The GoPro female mount is borrowed from g00bd0g - thingiverse.com/thing:6154" ;
