function: "This is very much in progress of being built and designed ad-hoc, But I've started on a Ultimaker style bot that is a meter cubed in volume. So that I can print a Chair!\r\n\r\nEach corner is printed on my Makerbot, and then standard 4x2 steel tubing can be inserted to make the frame.\r\n\r\nEach side is cross braced with threaded rod to make it true and the 16mm ground shafts are used as guides for the head.\r\n\r\nThe head is on a 10mm shaft and houses two LLU10's for smooth running.\r\n\r\nThe head is designed to accept up to 4 heads but I will need to figure out a way to keep the weight down, because even with 10mm shafting there is some flexing.\r\n\r\nThe platform when build will have two ball screw on opposite corners with two linear bearings on the other corners.\r\n\r\nEach axis will be powered by Nema23's at 48v going through some Gecko Drivers, but I intend to rig up my Makerbot Mother board to control this, so that I can re use the Extruder controller for the head.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I will start posting files when they are ready."
