So I made one instead.\r\n\r\nThis is a adjustable width PCB Holder with component holder so that you can flip it and solder. \r\n\r\nCan adjust the PCB to any 12 orientation on one axes and thus work easily on it. Very handy.\r\n\r\nThis project is using the Library from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6021"
