function: "In anticipation of the festive season, and the fact that we have a pounce on anything that remotely looks pouncable, cat, I needed to make some lockable bauble clips.\r\n\r\nSo here is a design for one. These can be made out of PLA if you want and thus when the tree gets thrown out you can throw the clips out as well. But they are also reuseable if you plan on making them out of ABS"
