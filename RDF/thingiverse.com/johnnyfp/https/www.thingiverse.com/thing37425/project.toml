function = "We have a Wetheim SM1000 steam mop, and the head can be detached by pressing a button to release the clip.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the clip bit broke and of course the unit is out of warranty.\r\n\r\nSo here is a replacement clip. Not the most interesting thing on thingiverse, but none the less useful if you have one of these mops and your clip is broken."
