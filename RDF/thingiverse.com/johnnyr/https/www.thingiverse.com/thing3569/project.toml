function = "Mashed Wades Geared Nema 17 with Adrian's hot end so I could check out Adrian's new hot end ( http://reprap.org/wiki/Geared_extruder_nozzle ) and another hot end by Tim. It is 14mm wider to allow 2 4mm bolts to attach to trapped 4mm nuts. This is only the extruder block the rest needs to be download from Wade\\'s original extruder or other derivatives there of.\r\n\r\nWarning - after some testing the bolts got too hot and pulled through the extruder block / redesign on the way."
