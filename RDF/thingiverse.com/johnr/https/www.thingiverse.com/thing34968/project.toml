function = "A parametric crowned pulley, inspired by DaleDunn's.\r\n\r\nI liked this idea over the flanged bearing covers, but I couldn't get a bearing to fit the original and thought it wasn't wide enough. With no access to SolidWorks I figured I'd redo the thing in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nThe second photo shows the size difference between DaleDunn's and mine."
