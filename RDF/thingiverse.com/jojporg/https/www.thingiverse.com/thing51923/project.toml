It was made by the participants of a workshop with the same name at \"One step back, Two steps forward\" exhibition on 22nd, Dec, 2012. It could be made with diverse materials include wood, acrylic, and paper through laser cutter or paper cutter. The result could be (hopefully) played with any record players.  \n\nWe provide the following songs with .ai and .pdf format.   \n.ai / ai-cutting_records.zip  \n.pdf / pdf-cutting_records.zip  \n\nArtist / Title  \n- coymd / of the dreamer  \n- Emiko Kashiwagi / A loop for eleven types of paper  \n- jojporg / a sweep  \n- jojporg / base  \n- kmpr / beats  \n- kmpr / C-C  \n- kmpr / modulation  \n- qurea / mimimi 121222 ep.1  \n- qurea / mimimi 121222 ep.2  \n- Shosei Oishi / test cutting 02  \n\nYou could see the process at Vimeo  \ncutting record - a record without (or with) prior acoustic information  \nhttps://vimeo.com/album/2278251"
