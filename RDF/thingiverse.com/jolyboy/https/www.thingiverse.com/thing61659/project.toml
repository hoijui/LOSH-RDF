function = "3DR GPS uBlox LEA-6 GPS mount to suit 450 size helicopters. This GPS unit is commonly used with Ardupilot hardware. It will fit on any 12mm tube so it will also fit many quadcopters!  \n\nIf you print this with translucent plastic (I used sliver) the status LEDs are still visible :)  \n\nUPDATE: I've added a 14mm version of the file for your convenience."
