function = "This is a reinforced Version of Simon's x carriage based on my slim LM8UU holders.\r\n\r\nI basically changed the following:\r\n* Beefed up the LM8UU clamps to 3mm wall thickness for better strength\r\n* Added extra support braces for stiffer frame, also between the belt clamps to allow more belt tightness without twisting the clamps or the whole carriage\r\n* Applied two fan mounts for multi-purpose fan or equipment installation (tiltable fan duct, LED ring light, etc.). Dimensions of mounting blocks are 10x10x15mm with hole for M3 screw right in the middle.."
