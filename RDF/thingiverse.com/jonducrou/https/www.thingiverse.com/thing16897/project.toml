function = "Set of planetary gears and arms to hold the planet gears in place.\r\n\r\nBased off OpenSCAD code from thing:7390 (after cutting out significant portions of it - because the original thing is much more than a toy).\r\n\r\nThe gear ratios are very interesting, and (at least at first) non-intuitive, depending on the part that is held stationary.\r\n\r\nWith a fixed Annulus or Sun, this gives 1:6.\r\nWith a fixed Planet carrier, this gives 1:5."
