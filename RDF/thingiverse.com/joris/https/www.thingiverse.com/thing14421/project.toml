function = "Updated and improved some things to better attach to the ultimaker. Works now with 100ml syringes. Still uses the filament for 'driving' the syringe. Also new are the end stop enlargers so the endstops still work with the syringe attached.  \nThe concept is more or less the other way round. The filament pulls the syringe and squeeze the material out.  \nfor more images and movies, see http://www.facebook.com/europerminutedesign"
