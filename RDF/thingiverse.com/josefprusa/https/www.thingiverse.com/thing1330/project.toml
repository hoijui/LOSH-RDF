function = "I\\'ve designed form for casting silicone button pad. They have exact same dimensions as buttons on monome. Now I have to do few more tries to avoid some errors but Itll be great. Designed in OpenSCAD and its parametrized, so you can generate as big form as you want :-) there is a room for LED inside button, just like in button pad from Sparkfun etc.\r\n\r\nIt works, but the feel of pressing isn't same as on the monome, I\\'ve updated design a little and it should be better now.\r\n\r\nIf you have vacuum chamber you are lucky and you can have bubble free cast :-)\r\n\r\nI\\'ve tried to embed some conductor when casting, but it wasn\\'t great idea. Next time > cast and then glue the conductor :-) (in this case simple aluminium foil) >>> any tip for better and easier conductor??\r\n\r\nFaceplate and PCB for this button pad is on the way too!! I\\'m looking forward to print my own MONOME!!"
