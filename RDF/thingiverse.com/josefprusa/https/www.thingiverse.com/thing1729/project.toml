Skeinforges faster and even prints better on some machines because of lower resolution holes!\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nRemember that if you are using them, you only need 5 parts printed with nut traps. The other clamps will need to be of the plain type so that a washer and bolt rest properly on them.\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nUpdated:\r\n- bigger holes, you should not have to drill them out"
