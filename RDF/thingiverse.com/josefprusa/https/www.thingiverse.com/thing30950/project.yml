Unfortunately it is closed source (Makerbot had to pay for Qt license to be able to close the source) Fortunately it is easy to bluff it and still use it with older machines!\r\n\r\n(Update: Sorry, official support should come \"soon\" http://www.makerbot.com/docs/makerware/use/ You have atleast inside look under the hood)\r\n\r\nI hope it helps you guys!\r\n\r\nAs I follow deeper and deeper I find more and more interesting stuff. I did another update to my post here http://josefprusa.cz/open-hardware-meaning/#update\r\n\r\nNice chronology is kept in this post http://marcuswolschon.blogspot.cz/2012/09/occupy-thingiverse.html\r\n\r\nSupport Open Hardware here http://news.ycombinator.com/news"
