function = "This is my first design in google sketchup! It is a goat mold for chocolate. My cousin is a chocolate maker (Dr. Chocolate in Seattle) and so I designed a mold for a fundraiser she is donating chocolates to--it is goat themed :)\r\n\r\nThe piece currently printing out on a Makerbot Cupcake in the Metrix Create:Space with a .35mm extruder head. So far it looks good and the guys and Metrix are extremely supportive and easy to work with.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the mold will be very usable for chocolate making...I'll post the results later.\r\n\r\nI'm open to any comments or suggestions, thanks!"
