function = "Celebrate your inner geek with a 3d binary representation of your initials. Carry it around in a necklace, a keychain, your bag or shirt or in your pocket in a creepy Bilbo Baggins way.\r\n\r\nASCII characters 32 to 126 are supported, so just plain english with common symbols. Each character in the input text will generate a line of bits, so it looks better for short words of 2 or 3 characters,  like your initials, a smilie face or 42.\r\n\r\nBits are printed from left to right, top to bottom, when viewing from the \"home\" view, unless \"Reverse Bit Direction\" is set, in which case it's right to left, top to bottom."
