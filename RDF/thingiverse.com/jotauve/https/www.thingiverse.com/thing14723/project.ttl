    okh:function """In this case, the SCAD code of the Scout printbot has been converted into OOML code ( iearobotics.com/oomlwiki/doku.php ). At the same time, the ScoutMega printbot derives from the MiniSkyBot ( thingiverse.com/thing:7989 ) by Obijuan ( thingiverse.com/obijuan ). The castor wheel in the rear part is the same as in the MiniSkyBot, but the OOML version ( thingiverse.com/thing:12198 ) by avalero ( thingiverse.com/avalero ) was employed.\r
\r
Here is a small video (in spanish): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=821ua42vHks\r
\r
The main design is the same as the Scout printbot, but an additional front bumper has been included in order to mount on it a gripper. The gripper selected is a modification of the one posted in ( thingiverse.com/thing:2415 ).\r
\r
The electronics consists on an Arduino Mega board and 3 Futaba S3003 servos (for both wheels and gripper).\r
\r
In the attached files, all the source code is provided: SCAD files and STL. There is algo a C++ file in which it is the code of the chassis using the OOML.\r
\r
 Additional things: \r
To assemble everything, you will need at least:\r
- 11 M3x8mm screws.\r
- 4 M3x20mm screws.\r
- 14 M3 nuts.\r
- 2 O-ring: 50x3 mm. \r
- 1 O-ring 16x3 mm.\r
\r
Realize that for the gripper I just used some plastic wire. You can do this as well but if you want to use screws (for a more robust coupling), you will need:\r
\r
- 6 M3x6mm screws.\r
- 6 more M3 nuts.\r
\r
TO DO: \r
- The gipper is too big according the size of the chassis. This make the printbot unstable sometimes.\r
\r
- Change the design to make it easier to assemble.\r
\r
- Improve the gripper anchorage. Right now it is very difficult to assemble.\r
\r
I'm sorry about this issues. That is what happens when an electronic design mechanics :)""" ;
