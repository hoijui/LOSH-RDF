function = "This coupling has been designed using OOML ( iearobotics.com/oomlwiki/doku.php ). When attaching the Dynamixel and the Hokuyo, you can easily convert a 2D range finder into a 3D one. \r\n\r\nHere is a small video (in spanish): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eFtwoCO7ZE\r\n\r\nAnother video of a very simillar design (printed with a commercial 3Dprinter) can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1OJ9bcBAIg\r\n\r\nThe code to control the devices can be found in www.mrgroup.es but it is not so clear. I will update it soon. It will probably be easier to contact me if you need the code.\r\n\r\n3 files are attached: a cpp (OOML code), a scad (generated by the OOML code) and a stl (to print)."
