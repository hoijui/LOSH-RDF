Their objective is to support the Arduino board, allowing to place a 9V battery below it. Its advantage is that the battery is just above the wheels, so the grip is slightly increased :)\r\n\r\nThe Arduino code which makes it able to navigate inside a corridor is also attached.\r\n\r\nVideo of NS-1 working here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKkJGlzjeCM"
