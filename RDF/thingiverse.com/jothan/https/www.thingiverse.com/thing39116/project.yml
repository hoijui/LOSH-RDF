function: "This is a bracket to mount a RAMPS board horizontally, on the inside of the bottom extrusions on my MendelMax. I like having the wires at the bottom, it is way less messy. I also like having the electronics contained within the frame.\r\n\r\nI recommend printing with support structures unless you can reliably pull off godlike bridges.\r\n\r\nSorry for the messy .scad file, I made this in less than an hour, it was needed quite urgently. I may clean it up in the future."
