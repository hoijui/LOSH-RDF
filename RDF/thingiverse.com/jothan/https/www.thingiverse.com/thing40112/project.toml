function = "Having the RAMPS electronics inside the printer frame, connecting a USB connector is pretty hazardous, both for me and for the current print.\r\n\r\nI made an extender with a USB B socket and a USB B cord I had laying around to connect my RAMPS. This is the bracket to hold the USB extension cord on the outside of the frame. The dimensions of the USB B socket match the USB specification, but make sure the face of it is 12 x 11.5 mm before printing.\r\n\r\nA variant without the plastic tab to clip the socket is also available should you desire to hot-glue the connector.\r\n\r\nThe soldering to extend the USB port of the RAMPS itself is left as an exercise to the reader."
