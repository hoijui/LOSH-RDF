function = "The X Y Z endstop kit is great, but the clamp with the Z endstop has a somewhat weak middle, leading to bending of the clamp. I prefer having the screws firmly screwed in, so that they stay in position with minimal deformation of the clamps. Since the original clamp has a small section in the middle, it is rather prone to deformation.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I have unioned the clamp with the endstop with the TL version of the X clamp. The rather quick and dirty result is a rigid clamp with an endstop.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the holes for the PBC nuts are not present in the clamp, make sure your screws do not stick out of the top of the clamp before printing this."
