    okh:function """iPad Holder\r
This is a simple holder for the iPad that I made so I could hand my iPad next to my bead and use the headphone to listen to music at night. \r
\r
I ended up not needing the side mount but included it here anyway. \r
\r
Good double sided tape seems to hold nicely but if you donâ€™t trust it put some screws in. Sorry if the screw holes are a little large.\r
\r
Works well as both portrait or landscape. Also should fit with most iPad covers""" ;
