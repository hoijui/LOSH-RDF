function: "iPad Holder\r\nThis is a simple holder for the iPad that I made so I could hand my iPad next to my bead and use the headphone to listen to music at night. \r\n\r\nI ended up not needing the side mount but included it here anyway. \r\n\r\nGood double sided tape seems to hold nicely but if you don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t trust it put some screws in. Sorry if the screw holes are a little large.\r\n\r\nWorks well as both portrait or landscape. Also should fit with most iPad covers"
