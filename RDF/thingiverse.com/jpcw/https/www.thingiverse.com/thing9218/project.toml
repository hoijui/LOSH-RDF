function = "This is a simple SD Card holder that holds up to 8 SD cards. The slots are a little tight to stop the cards falling out if you knock over the holder. Very simple design and prints well without a raft on my heated build platform.\r\n\r\nI tried using a bit of FeastWatson Prooftint oak wood stain on it and the effect is quite good. I didnâ€™t expect the stain to go very well on the ABS but it comes out really nice"
