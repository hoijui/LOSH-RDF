function: "This is an LED indicator holder that clips onto the side mirrors of a motorbike.\r\n\r\nOn my motorbike I have to keep looking down to see if my indicators are on so I decided to wire some LED\xE2\u20AC\u2122s to my indicators and stick them to the mirrors. The problem was that nothing stuck to the chrome very well. This is where the clips come in. They still need some super glue to stop them slipping off but because the clips take most of the strain the clue seems to hold well enough now. \r\n\r\nAs mirrors are different shapes you will probably need to tweak the design to get them to fit.\r\n\r\nThe LED\xE2\u20AC\u2122s are standard 2V orange 20ma and are connected to the indicators via a 560 Ohm resistor."
