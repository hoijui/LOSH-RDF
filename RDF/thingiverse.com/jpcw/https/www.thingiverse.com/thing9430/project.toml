function = "This is a simple small pegboard. Just stick it up with some good double sided tape and you can hang a few small tools wherever you like. \r\n\r\nHad a little trouble printing without a raft as it wanted to print the circles first and they didnâ€™t stick too well. Still came out fairly well though.\r\n\r\nI have added the files for a small pin. The idea is that you can print holders with a 5mm hole and then use the pin to attach them to the pegbord\r\n\r\nNext step is to print some hangers to go with it."
