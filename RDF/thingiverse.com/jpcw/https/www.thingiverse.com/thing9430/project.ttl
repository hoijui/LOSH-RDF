\r
Had a little trouble printing without a raft as it wanted to print the circles first and they didnâ€™t stick too well. Still came out fairly well though.\r
\r
I have added the files for a small pin. The idea is that you can print holders with a 5mm hole and then use the pin to attach them to the pegbord\r
\r
Next step is to print some hangers to go with it.""" ;
