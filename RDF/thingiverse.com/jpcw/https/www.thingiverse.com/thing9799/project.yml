function: This is a simple slide mounting system. I wanted to fix a few items to my desk such as USB hubs etc but also wanted to be able to detach them temporarily so I did up this quick slide together mounting system. You can attach one to a desk or wall with double side tape or screws and the other to the object you want to mount. Then you simply slide them together or apart.
