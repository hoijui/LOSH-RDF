function = "This is a derivative of www.thingiverse.com/thing:7544  \n\nIt is two piece device allows you to get a firm hold on any type of textile without puncturing them. The first part of the device, which we will call the lock (get here: www.thingiverse.com/thing:7544), fits closely into the base, which we will call the star because of the original resemblance to a ninja throwing star. In this derivative the 4 prong star is simplified into two prongs to cut down on polymer use and print time. This device has numerous useful applications around the home no matter where you live.  \n\nAll of the original applications will still work:  \n1. Stretcher -? 6 fasteners, a blanket and 2 poles  \n2. Hammock - 2 fasteners and a blanket  \n3. Emergency Tent -? 4 fasteners and a plastic sheet or tarp  \n4. Greenhouse or row guard - Use a number of fasteners and clear plastic to create a greenhouse  \n5. Food transport - Use some form of fabric and 4 fasteners to make flexible box for carrying things like vegetables  \n6. Improved Tarps:  \n* You can use a fastener to fix a grommet that has popped out of a normal tarp.  \n* You can also use a number of fasteners to join multiple tarps together into a bigger tarp  \n* You can create a custom waterproof cover  \n* You can use the fasteners to hold the tarp in a custom way for another function -? such as rain water collection or roof leak or boat protector.   \nThe project webpage is [here](http://appropedia.org/Printable_non-puncturing_textile_fastener)"
