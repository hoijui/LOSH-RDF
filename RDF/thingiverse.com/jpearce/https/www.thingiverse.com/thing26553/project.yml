function: "This Arduino-controlled open-source automated filter-wheel changer is set up to move to 8 different filter positions. Normally these devices are used in scientific experiments that need good optics. Commercial versions cost over $2,500 and you can make this yourself for less than $50. So if you make just one --  you more than justify the purchase of your own open source 3-D printer!  \r\n\r\nThis component is part of the [Open-source optics project](http://www.appropedia.org/Open_source_optics), whose goal is to radically reduce the cost of scientific optical hardware:by the [Michigan Tech's Open Sustainability Technology Research Group](http://www.appropedia.org/Category:MOST).  \r\n\r\nFor similar see the [Open-Source Lab How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs](http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab)\r\n\r\nThis project was featured in an article and podcase in [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1303/suppl/DC1). Pearce, Joshua M. 2012. Building Research Equipment with Free, Open-Source Hardware. Science 337 (6100): 1303-1304."
