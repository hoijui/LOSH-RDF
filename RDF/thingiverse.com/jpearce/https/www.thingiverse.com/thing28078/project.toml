function = "This device allows you to make functional heat exchangers by welding together layers of plastic garbage bags!   \r\n\r\nThis may be counter intuitive, but our latest theoretical and early experimental results show that this type of heat exchanger can be very efficient as well as absurdly cheap.   \r\n\r\nThis component is part of an open source lab library, by the [Michigan Tech's Open Sustainability Technology Research Group](http://www.appropedia.org/Category:MOST).  \r\n\r\nFor similar see the [Open-Source Lab How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs](http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab)"
