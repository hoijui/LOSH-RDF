    okh:function """This is part of a system of prints that turns an Open Beam into an optical rail. An optical rail is a long, straight, sturdy rail onto which optical components such as light sources and lenses can be bolted down and easily shifted along the length of the rail.  \r
\r
Commercial optical rail sells for $115/ft. Open beam only costs $10/m or $12/m for the fancy black anodized stuff. You get the idea.  \r
\r
\r
This component is part of the [Open-source optics project](http://www.appropedia.org/Open_source_optics), whose goal is to radically reduce the cost of scientific optical hardware:  by the [Michigan Tech's Open Sustainability Technology Research Group](http://www.appropedia.org/Category:MOST).  \r
