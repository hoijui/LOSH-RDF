    okh:function """With the heated discussions concerning the terms of use for Thingiverse, I thought it would be constructive to systematically lay out the framework for an improved repository of open-source digital designs. This way if Thingiverse can mend the fences with the open-source hardware community, they can use it and improve what they have now. If not, and others build a new repository they will have a superior framework from which to start. If you would like to help with this -?? please just add ideas to the comments and I will include them in the plan and, of course, acknowledge your contributions in anything that comes from it.  

This will be based in a large part on the work being done on [open-source appropriate technology for sustainable development](http://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1880726/A_new_model_for_enabling_innovation_in_appropriate_technology_for_sustainable_development).""" ;
