function: "This is part of a system of prints that turns an OpenBeam into an optical rail. This part holds a screen perpendicular to the optical rail.   \r\n\r\nAn optical rail is a long, straight, sturdy rail onto which optical components such as light sources and lenses can be bolted down and easily shifted along the length of the rail. Commercial optical rail sells for $380/m ($115/ft). Open beam only costs $12/m ...You get the idea.  \r\n\r\nThis component is part of the [Open-source optics project](http://www.appropedia.org/Open_source_optics), whose goal is to radically reduce the cost of scientific optical hardware:  by the [Michigan Tech's Open Sustainability Technology Research Group](http://www.appropedia.org/Category:MOST).  \r\n\r\nFor similar see the [Open-Source Lab How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs](http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab)"
