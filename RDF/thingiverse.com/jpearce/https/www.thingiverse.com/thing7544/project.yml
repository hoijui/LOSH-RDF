function: "This two piece device allows you to get a firm hold on any type of textile without puncturing them. The first part of the device, which we will call the lock (shown in blue), fits closely into the base, which we will call the star because of its resemblance to a ninja throwing star (shown in red). This device has numerous useful applications around the home no matter where you live.   \n\nThe project webpage is [here](http://www.appropedia.org/Printable_non-puncturing_textile_fastener)  \n\n1.
