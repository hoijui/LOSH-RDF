    okh:function """UPDATE: There were a few small errors on the Top and Bottom. I have realigned the screw holes, changed all nut traps to 6.5mm across. There are three nut traps that are shallower than those that are extruded into a solid this is to retain strength. I suggest you use next M3 x 20mm screw for these three. I have also added counter bore holes to the top so that 16mm screw reaches and it is easier to Velcro electronics on top.  

This is a fully 3D printable Tricopter based on the RC Explorer V2.5 by David WindestÃ¥l. There are 6 Parts that need to be printed and then it can be assembled using 3mm screw and nuts, and some zip ties.
