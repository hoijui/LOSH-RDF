function = "Metzench designed an open 16mm saddle carriage for the Igus RJM-01-08 plastic linear bearing.  The Igus bearings require a 16mm bushing to \"squeeze\" the ribbed bearing to 8mm tolerance.  I modified the SCAD from Johann's original Rostock carriage to have a 16mm enclosed sleeve for holding the bearing.\r\n\r\nI should add that I am currently building a Johann's Rostock with 8mm rods, and hope to use these simple and cheap bearings instead of the loud and expensive metal ones.  We'll see how it goes."
