function: "For mounting Ultibot Microstruder under the print platform.  This extruder uses the PG35L Minbea geared stepper.  In order to fit it onto the Rostock platform, I decided to mount the whole shebang below the platform.  It weighs exactly 200g with the mounting screws, and after trimming the unused base mount part of the Ultibot extruder. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39098\r\n\r\nI tried mounting above the platform, but either the extruder or the motor would hit the diagonal rods, constraining movement and/or \"twanging\" the deltabot.\r\n\r\nWhat this thing does is mount to the mounting holes for the stepper opposite the extruder, giving somewhere to attach the assembly to the print platform.  The \"Under Extruder\" block wraps around the motor, so long 3mmX40mm mounting screws, like the ones for the filament idler, are used.\r\n\r\nI was going to modify the files for the Ultibot micro extruder, but the Alibre file was too complicated for my skillset.  The nice thing about my solution, is that it may fit many other extruders using this same lightweight stepper, as the mount locations are set by the motor, and not the particular extruder you want to use."
