function = "This is my derivative of daewootech's \"DIY Glasses\", by far the best looking shutter sunglasses on Thingiverse. Unfortunately a .cdr file does nothing for me as I wanted to print these bad boys. I ended up rebuilding them in solidworks with the jpg as a template. I added hinges, changed the shutter ratio, redesigned the arms a bit and put in a little extra detail for those who like it gangsta.. Printed exceptionally in ABS on the Ultimaker. Enjoy!"
