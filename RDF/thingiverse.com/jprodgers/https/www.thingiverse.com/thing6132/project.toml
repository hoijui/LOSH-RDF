function = "I wanted a dice tower for rolling large quantities of dice during games. I didn't see one on here, so I made one real quick. I won't have access to a laser cutter for at least another week, so I haven't tested this yet. If you do cut it out let me know how well it does. I'm sure that it will require some revisions, as well as art."
