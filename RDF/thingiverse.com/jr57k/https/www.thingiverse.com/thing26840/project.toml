function = "An extended version for LC+ users that have deck and bridge issues.  Three files are included a 10mm extended version, a 20mm extended version and a 13mm extended y-belt clip to keep things aligned.\r\n\r\nThis is a modification to the Printrbot's Y BarEnds (pb-Y-BarEnds-x4.skp). It has been tested on a printrbot and it works with a size 6-32 lock nut.\r\n\r\nPurpose: This design might allow for a shorter bolt to be used and assembly with fewer tools."
