function = "My big power supply that delivers 12V/5A and 18V/15A for the heated print bed via the XLR connector is great, but it's big and noisy due to the cooling fan.  When I'm only printing PLA (which is most of the time) I prefer to use a small, silent and nice looking \"laptop replacement\" power brick, which I connect via a standard coax power connector."
