    okh:function """This uses the boltable PLA bushings from Aleph Objects and takes a groovemount extruder/hotend.  The extruder sits on a raised mounting area so that it can overlap the bushing mount screws, resulting in a carriage that is both smaller and stiffer.\r
Includes a belt tightener with ram (ram borrowed from Triffid Hunter).  There's code in the SCAD for a preliminary fan mount which has been mangled by me from an original by Greg Frost I think.  I had to beat on it because I had to print this right side up to get the raised area.  I will update this later when I finish with the fan mount.""" ;
