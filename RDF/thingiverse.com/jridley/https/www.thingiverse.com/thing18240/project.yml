function: "Just in time for spring, make pots for starting plants in out of newspaper, with no adhesive or tape.  You can directly bury these in the ground which does not disturb the roots, allowing you to start delicate-rooted plants like melons and cucumbers inside.  \nThe main cylinder is almost entirely hollow to save filament, mine uses about 8m of 3mm filament at 30% fill, which is very very strong."
