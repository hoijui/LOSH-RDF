function = "I didn't think the mounts that came with my Contour Roam were trustworthy so I quickly designed this one.  It's got a bit of a curve on the mounting surface to match the side of a helmet.  \nIncludes a detent bump with an integral springy rail behind it so the camera snaps into place.  \nThis should be in pretty good shape as is but I have not ridden with it yet."
