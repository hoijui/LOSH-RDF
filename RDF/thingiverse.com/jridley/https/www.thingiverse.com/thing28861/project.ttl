    okh:function """I was delighted by Chri's endstop holder - elegant looking and a real improvement over the standard.  It fits in tighter spots and should hold adjustment better.  I needed an SAE version though, so I threw together an OpenSCAD version.\r
\r
The included STL is for #6 SAE screws and nuts (5/16" wrench size).  The SCAD is there if you want to fiddle.\r
\r
I removed most of the 4th wall on the switch from Chri's design since it does nothing - the bigger gap also makes it easier to get the switch out if you need to do so.""" ;
