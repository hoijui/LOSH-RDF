    okh:function """I've tried a lot of different LM8UU holders but found that most of them were fragile, overly complicated or had some other thing that irritated me, I came up with this design which is really simple, prints very fast, is pretty much impossible to break and holds linear bearings very solidly.  
It only goes halfway up the side of the bearing, since I realized that there's nothing to be gained by going farther than that.  
The bearings are held in place with small zip ties.  There is a channel that the zip ties push through.  The holder can be incorporated in another object and the channel will remain and the zip tie can still be pushed through.  
This is written as a module so it can be incorporated into other things; I have an X and a Y carriage that I will be uploading as well.""" ;
