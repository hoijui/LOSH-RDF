function = "This X carriage starts with the LM8UU holders I designed to be very simple and adds a fan bracket that tilts and also a pair of 5mm LED holders.\r\n\r\nThe fan bracket is optional and can go on either side (or both if you want to go nuts on that).  The LED size can be varied in the SCAD as well."
