function = "So I got my MakerBot working and I realized how hard it is to measure things with just a ruler. So I decided to design myself some digital calipers. \r\n\r\nIt is made of 2 parts, a top and a bottom. The bottom half has a overhang on it so that it can enclose the top half. So its a good idea to have a cooling fan on for this print. \r\n\r\nThe top half should just slide right into the bottom half. \r\n\r\nEnjoy."
