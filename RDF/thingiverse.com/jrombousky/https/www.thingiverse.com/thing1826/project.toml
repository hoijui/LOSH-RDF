function = "This is an improved Printruder. It can now hold the Plastruder control board and can wipe down your filament. The old problems of mis-aligning your filament are gone now too. \r\n\r\nThis is a modification of the model by Zaggo www.thingiverse.com/thing:958\r\n\r\nCome and check out the youtube video about it at:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPkTAH_NvaQ\r\n\r\nUPDATE: ssd pointed out trouble with the overhang mentioned for the PCB support. Considering to make this an easier print overall please print out the \"Bearing Holder Overhangless thx ssd.stl\" or gcode file if you do not want to worry about putting in your own support material. Good luck."
