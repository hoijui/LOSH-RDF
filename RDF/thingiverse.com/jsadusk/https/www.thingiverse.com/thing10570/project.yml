function: "I'm always losing the damn caps for my inner tube valves, and you can't get new caps without buying a new inner tube.  This print keeps me from having to steal caps from my spare tires.\r\n\r\nNote: For those of you trying to make this work on Schrader valves, I just posted http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10700\r\n\r\nIf you don't know whether you have Schrader or Presta, if you're in the US you probably have Schrader, and if you're in Europe you probably have Presta."
