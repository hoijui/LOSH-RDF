function = "I recently posted a valve cap for Presta valves ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10570 ), but at least in the US Schrader valves are much more common.  So I made a Schrader version.  Replace your constantly lost valve caps!\r\n\r\nIf you don't know whether you have Schrader or Presta, if you're in the US you probably have Schrader, and if you're in Europe you probably have Presta."
