    okh:function """I have a pre-Prusa Mendel and my crappy threaded rod leadscrews seized up, so I decided to move to ACME threaded rods.  After procuring some 5/16ths rod and hex nuts, I found that even though the rod was the same diameter as my previous triangualar threaded rod, the nuts had a larger outer diameter and wouldn't fit in the existing Mendel nut traps.  So, here is a redesigned nut trap with the right dimensions for a 5/16 ACME thread heavy duty nut.\r
\r
The original was done in Art of Illusion, which I've always found very unwieldy, and its completely non-parametric.  So I did a redesign.  I've been curious to try out QTmium ( https://github.com/hmeyer/qtmium ) so that's what I used to design it.  Its fully parametric if you want to modify it to fit other nuts.""" ;
