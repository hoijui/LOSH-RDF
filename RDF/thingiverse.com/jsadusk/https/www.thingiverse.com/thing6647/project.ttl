Say you're printing a device enclosure and you want it to have an ethernet port, or you just want to use RJ-45 as a convenient 8 pin connector.  Add this to your design and you can use the modular RJ-45 jacks sold at hardware stores that are meant to clip into wall plates.\r
\r
Updated: Tightened the opening to clip more securely, cleaned up the openscad code, and made the whole thing a module to more facilitate use in other designs.  Now jacks clip in so tightly that its hard to get them out again.""" ;
