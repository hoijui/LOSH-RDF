function = "All the overhead lights in my apartment are Circline fluorescents lamps, and they all have a plastic clip that holds the bulb in place and clips to the center of the fixture.  I broke one of these clips, so of course I printed a replacement.  I have no idea if the part of the fixture it clips into is a standard size but the openscad files should be easy to customize to yours if its different."
