function = "This is my first tinkercad model, thus it's not perfectly smooth. Also it's not the same shape as the original FyrFlyz grips. Printed in .25mm PLA its much stronger than expected.\r\n\r\nI am sorry not to provide the sources, but as tinkercad allows only one model at a time to be saved in a free account, it would soon be gone anyway."
