function: "the handpresso is an awesome little portable manual espresso maker.\r\n\r\nthe domepod version allows you to use pre-ground (fresh!) espresso. however, due to its small size, it is quite difficult to fill (especially for clumsy people like me)... so i decide to make a small funnel for it. (similar to thing:21802, but for a slightly different purpose).\r\n\r\ni made the inner diameter 32mm for the first print based on the specs of the domepod basket, and it fits fine in the domepod.\r\n\r\nstill learning how to use blender... if there's anything that i should have done different, please let me know!\r\n\r\np.s. i am not affiliated with handpresso in any way :)"
