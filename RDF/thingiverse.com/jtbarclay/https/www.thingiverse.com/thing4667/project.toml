function = "A small printable Van de Graaff generator.\r\n\r\nDesigned to use common household parts, once you have the printed parts...\r\n\r\nThe MakerBot is currently not cooperating so I haven't tested this yet. The prototype it's based on was made of pvc pipe and was about twice as tall. It generated around 6kV (old possibly uncalibrated electrostatic voltmeter) and visible 2\" sparks."
