function: Last weekend, we had a canoe sliding around on my friend's kayak/canoe trailer.  It's a really nice setup with 1 1/4" aluminum tubes but the two canoes on the top had a tendency to slide to the sides.  These brackets slip on the horizontal tubes to prevent side to side motion.  Years ago I had a Yakima roof rack and was amazed at the improvement with gunwale brackets.
