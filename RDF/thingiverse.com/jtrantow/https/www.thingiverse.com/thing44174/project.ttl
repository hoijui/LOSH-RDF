    okh:function """When I purchased my wax table a few years ago, I only purchased one profile thinking I could only work on one ski at a time. But when waxing multiple pairs of skis (especially my daughter's short skis), it is a pain to readjust and take skis on and off. So I purchased some 3/4" al tube and cut the rough shape of a ski from a 2x6 for the profile and then printed these pieces to hold the ski and profile to the table. One trip to the hardware store for metric bolts and threaded rod and I now have a two ski setup.  

The photos show the original pieces in black and the functionally equivalent.printed pieces in red.   

--- UPDATE -----  
Original holder broke after a year of use. Break occurred near bolt in the middle. I updated the files with a beefed up part. I also rounded some corners and improved the nut holder. I left the old parts up, but use the new parts if you build one.  

--- UPDATE 2 ---  
Binding holder failure at the pin(nail) after another ski season. Increased the diameter around the pin. ski_vise3. The original Swix profile screw also failed (stripped inside the plastic knob) so I modified the profile_nut2 since my original was a little harsh on the fingers.""" ;
