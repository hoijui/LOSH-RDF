function = "This is a 3D puzzle of a elephant. It is made of 1 mm plywood by using a CO2 Laser Cutter.\r\n\r\nLast weeks I looked for designs of animals. I found some animal models, but the most models were to big or the connection of the parts were bad. So I made a new construction of all models by using a CAD program. I scaled them, corrected some mistakes in the models und made a good connection between the puzzle parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nmore information and other projects you will find under: http://www.jtronics.de/tag/3dpuzzle/\r\n\r\nDiscover my other designs: https://www.thingiverse.com/jtronics/designs\r\n\r\nFOLLOW / SUBSCRIBE so you don't miss our new Design.\r\n————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.jtronics.de/\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jtronics.de/\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jtronics2\r\nyoutube: https://www.youtube.com/jtronicsTV\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jtronics.de/\r\nThingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/jtronics/designs"
