\r
Last weeks I looked for designs of animals. I found some animal models, but the most models were to big or the connection of the parts were bad. So I made a new construction of all models by using a CAD program. I scaled them, corrected some mistakes in the models und made a good connection between the puzzle parts.\r
\r
I didn't find the Link of the original Model again. If somebody knows the link to the website, please let me know or post it on this site. Thanks!\r
