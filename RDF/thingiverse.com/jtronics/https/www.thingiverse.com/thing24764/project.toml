function = "Some time ago I looked for a new design for our bird house for our garden. I found a very nice design and made a new construction by using a CAD program. The bird house is made of 3mm plywood. Now I hope that the birds will love it.\r\n\r\nI have changed some details in the construction. The hole has a diameter of 32mm. This is the optimal diameter for birds like  titmouses.\r\nI have also shortened the lenght of the perch.\r\n\r\nDiscover my other designs: https://www.thingiverse.com/jtronics/designs\r\n\r\nFOLLOW / SUBSCRIBE so you don't miss our new Design.\r\n————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.jtronics.de/\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jtronics.de/\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jtronics2\r\nyoutube: https://www.youtube.com/jtronicsTV\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jtronics.de/\r\nThingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/jtronics/designs"
