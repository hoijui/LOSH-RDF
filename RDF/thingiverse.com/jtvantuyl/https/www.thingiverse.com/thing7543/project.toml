function = "See http://www.appropedia.org/Printable_Baby_Bottle for details! This is a simple top that can be screwed onto a standard \"Coke\" bottle sized screw top to make it a baby bottle! This was made to complement this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7536.\r\n\r\nI do not take responsibility for the safety or functionality of this thing. Please use common sense, and if you do make one, post feedback! This is all done with the student edition of SolidEdge. You won't be able to open it in any other version. Please don't sell this or anything, as that will make the good people at SolidEdge angry. \r\n\r\nI have also uploaded .stl files. I am trying to find a better thread design, as this was adapted using measurments taken from a bottle. If anybody has seen a public domain model that is actually made by a company that produces these things, let me know!"
