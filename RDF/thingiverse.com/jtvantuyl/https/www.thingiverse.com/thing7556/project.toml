function = "This is a very rough Mixed Oxidant Generator. Check out http://www.appropedia.org/Printable_Mixed_Oxidant_Generator for more details. It is used to make oxidants which can be used to sterilize water. I have uploaded 2 SolidEdge files and one .stl file to get you going. The first has one manometer, the second seperate ones for the oxygen and hydrogen that will be evolved. The manometers are not sensitive enough (I think). Please feel free to experiment. There is a lot of work to be done, but for a very worthy cause!"
