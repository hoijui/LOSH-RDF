    okh:function """I needed a couple of spanners to adjust the bed levelling screws on my Prusa Mendel. At first, I was going to download and print one, but then I decided to have a go at my very first real creation (from concept to physical print). \r
\r
I measured the M3 nuts with my digital callipers (5.4 mm across flats / 2.3 mm thick), and designed a spanner with an open end at one end and a hex ring at the other, using Alibre Design PE(Personal Edition). I increased the gap by 0.5 mm (to allow for plastic shrinkage, and to allow the spanner to fit over the nuts easily), and exported an STL file. I then printed a pair. \r
\r
They don't look too clean in the photo, but that is because my machine is brand new, and I am still learning how to optimise and calibrate it.\r
\r
I am sure there are many other 3 mm Spanners you can download, but this is my own design, and I am proud of it!\r
\r
I have uploaded the Alibre model file for those with Alibre PE who may want to modify the design; otherwise, just download the STL file.""" ;
