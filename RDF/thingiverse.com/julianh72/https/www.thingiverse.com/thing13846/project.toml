function = "Just in time for Holiday Season â€“ an ideal Christmas Gift for the university students in your life!\r\n\r\nGame play:\r\n...\r\nPlayer 1:\tB4\r\nPlayer 2:\tHit! (Glug, glug, glug) ... C7\r\nPlayer 1:\tMiss! ... B5\r\nPlayer 2:\tHit â€“ you sank my Destroyer! (Glug, glug, glug) ... D4\r\n...\r\n(Well, Iâ€™m sure you get the gist by now.)\r\n\r\nThese designs were made for a friend who was sent an e-mail of a drinking game which has been doing the rounds lately:   http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/1011/battleshots-fun-games-demotivational-poster-1289595810.jpg \r\n\r\nThe ship designs were created in Alibre Personal, for a cheap plastic disposable shot glass (28 mm base diameter; 41 mm top diameter; 41 mm high; to be played on a 48 mm x 48 mm grid). The models are parametric, so can be easily edited for different governing dimensions; but sorry, I am not clever enough to do this sort of modelling as parametric models on OpenSCAD. For alternative sized glasses, if you donâ€™t have access to Alibre, you could just scale the STL files, or model something similar yourself using OpenSCAD, or other CAD software of your choice.\r\n\r\nThe models are hollow shells without a bottom (to save material), and should be able to print OK without internal support, as long as you have â€œbridgingâ€x9d working OK. \r\n\r\n[Edit: On reflection, I think you will probably need external support for the Aircraft Carrier models, because of the overhanging \"flight deck\".]\r\n\r\nNote that the 4-shotglass Battleship (212.3 mm long) and the 5-shotglass Aircraft Carrier (264.5 mm long) are too big to be printed on my Prusa Mendel, but I have included them for anyone who has a bigger print bed (or wants to scale them down for a smaller shotglass). The 4-shotglass Battleship will however fit when printed at 45-degree orientation (159.2 mm x 159.2 mm). The 4-shotglass Small Aircraft Carrier is there because â€“ well, every Navy has to have at least ONE aircraft carrier (to be the flagship!)"
