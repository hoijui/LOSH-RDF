Game play:\r

Player 1:	B4\r
Player 2:	Hit! (Glug, glug, glug) ... C7\r
Player 1:	Miss! ... B5\r
Player 2:	Hit â€“ you sank my Destroyer! (Glug, glug, glug) ... D4\r

(Well, Iâ€™m sure you get the gist by now.)\r

These designs were made for a friend who was sent an e-mail of a drinking game which has been doing the rounds lately:   http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/1011/battleshots-fun-games-demotivational-poster-1289595810.jpg \r
\r
The ship designs were created in Alibre Personal, for a cheap plastic disposable shot glass (28 mm base diameter; 41 mm top diameter; 41 mm high; to be played on a 48 mm x 48 mm grid). The models are parametric, so can be easily edited for different governing dimensions; but sorry, I am not clever enough to do this sort of modelling as parametric models on OpenSCAD. For alternative sized glasses, if you donâ€™t have access to Alibre, you could just scale the STL files, or model something similar yourself using OpenSCAD, or other CAD software of your choice.\r
\r
The models are hollow shells without a bottom (to save material), and should be able to print OK without internal support, as long as you have â€œbridgingâ€x9d working OK. \r
\r
[Edit: On reflection, I think you will probably need external support for the Aircraft Carrier models, because of the overhanging "flight deck".]\r
\r
Note that the 4-shotglass Battleship (212.3 mm long) and the 5-shotglass Aircraft Carrier (264.5 mm long) are too big to be printed on my Prusa Mendel, but I have included them for anyone who has a bigger print bed (or wants to scale them down for a smaller shotglass). The 4-shotglass Battleship will however fit when printed at 45-degree orientation (159.2 mm x 159.2 mm). The 4-shotglass Small Aircraft Carrier is there because â€“ well, every Navy has to have at least ONE aircraft carrier (to be the flagship!)""" ;
