function: "Just in time for Holiday Season \xE2\u20AC\u201C an ideal Christmas Gift for the university students in your life!\r\n\r\nGame play:\r\n...\r\nPlayer 1:\tB4\r\nPlayer 2:\tHit! (Glug, glug, glug) ... C7\r\nPlayer 1:\tMiss! ... B5\r\nPlayer 2:\tHit \xE2\u20AC\u201C you sank my Destroyer! (Glug, glug, glug) ... D4\r\n...\r\n(Well, I\xE2\u20AC\u2122m sure you get the gist by now.)\r\n\r\nThese designs were made for a friend who was sent an e-mail of a drinking game which has been doing the rounds lately:   http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/1011/battleshots-fun-games-demotivational-poster-1289595810.jpg \r\n\r\nThe ship designs were created in Alibre Personal, for a cheap plastic disposable shot glass (28 mm base diameter; 41 mm top diameter; 41 mm high; to be played on a 48 mm x 48 mm grid). The models are parametric, so can be easily edited for different governing dimensions; but sorry, I am not clever enough to do this sort of modelling as parametric models on OpenSCAD. For alternative sized glasses, if you don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t have access to Alibre, you could just scale the STL files, or model something similar yourself using OpenSCAD, or other CAD software of your choice.\r\n\r\nThe models are hollow shells without a bottom (to save material), and should be able to print OK without internal support, as long as you have \xE2\u20AC\u0153bridging\xE2\u20AC\x9D working OK. \r\n\r\n[Edit: On reflection, I think you will probably need external support for the Aircraft Carrier models, because of the overhanging \"flight deck\".]\r\n\r\nNote that the 4-shotglass Battleship (212.3 mm long) and the 5-shotglass Aircraft Carrier (264.5 mm long) are too big to be printed on my Prusa Mendel, but I have included them for anyone who has a bigger print bed (or wants to scale them down for a smaller shotglass). The 4-shotglass Battleship will however fit when printed at 45-degree orientation (159.2 mm x 159.2 mm). The 4-shotglass Small Aircraft Carrier is there because \xE2\u20AC\u201C well, every Navy has to have at least ONE aircraft carrier (to be the flagship!)"
