Sure, I could have just downloaded someone elseâ€™s design like this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13807 or this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5246  or this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13065 â€“ but whereâ€™s the fun in that? Far more satisfying to design and print your own!\r\nSo I created a design in Alibre, exported the STL, and printed a set of 4 (in a single nested print). (I have uploaded the Alibre file for anyone who wants to modify the design for other applications; sorry, no OpenSCAD files, but it shouldnâ€™t be too hard to design something similar in OpenSCAD!)"
