function: "So, I wanted to make it easier to level my print bed (Mendel Prusa, mounted on 4 x M3 bolts with springs), and the obvious answer was to install thumbwheels to make it easier to adjust each levelling screw quickly and easily. Sure, I could have just downloaded someone else\xE2\u20AC\u2122s design like this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13807 or this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5246  or this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13065 \xE2\u20AC\u201C but where\xE2\u20AC\u2122s the fun in that? Far more satisfying to design and print your own!\r\nSo I created a design in Alibre, exported the STL, and printed a set of 4 (in a single nested print). (I have uploaded the Alibre file for anyone who wants to modify the design for other applications; sorry, no OpenSCAD files, but it shouldn\xE2\u20AC\u2122t be too hard to design something similar in OpenSCAD!)"
