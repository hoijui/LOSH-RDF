function: "After looking at a lot of spool holders, and realizing that most would not fit a 2.3 Kg spool, or could not be printed on a Prusa, I decided to design my own. This was the first part I designed and printed.\r\n\r\nThis configuration has the advantages of never rubbing on the top bars. Allows very fast replacement of spools."
