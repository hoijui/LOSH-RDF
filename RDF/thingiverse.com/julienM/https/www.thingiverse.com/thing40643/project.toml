function = "A derivative, maintaining the assembly procedure, but hopefully improving the aerodynamics.\r\n\r\nIncludes a drop-in replacement, in which the wing profile is swept to make a smoother surface.\r\n\r\nThe other part is much larger and based on   a NACA 2818 profile, which should apparently improve power. The arms are a much narrower oval shape to reduce drag."
