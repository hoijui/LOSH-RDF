function: "For a new printer I am designing, the goal was to make the machine look more like a consumer good. I'm very happy with the quality of my Prusa, but it does look very functional.\r\n\r\nVents on the side pass the air coming out of the heatsinks down to the parts printing. This was designed for two Qu-BD extruders. Those heatsinks pass the air sideways only. Tests with a flame showed a lot of air getting to the bottom."
