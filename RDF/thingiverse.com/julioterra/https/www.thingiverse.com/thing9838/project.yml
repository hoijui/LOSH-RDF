function: "A few weeks ago I went out looking for a set of stackable bins. I was looking for bins for my work table, which is located in my small apartment's living room/office; so I wanted to find something that looks good.  After spending a many hours searching on google, amazon, container store, and ebay I decided to design my own set of bins. \r\n\r\nStackables were created to store small electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, switches, leds, and pots. They are designed so that you can easily stack and re-arrange them. Each bin measures 3\" x 3\" x 6\".  To date I have only created stackables using acrylic, though you should be able to use other materials have appropriate thickness, 1/8\", and strength."
