function: "A coke and mentos driven engine.\r\n\r\nInspired by their recent rocket car, but exploring alternative designs to increase efficiency and reduce wastage of my fav soft drink*\r\n\r\nSee the rocket car here: http://www.eepybird.com/featured-video/the-coke-zero-mentos-rocket-car-2d/\r\n\r\nThe EepyEngine is driven by the usual 0.5 inch PVC/Coke/Mentos setup, and hopes to be a lot more efficient than driving acrylic rods. You can also mount many of them together through a long M6 threaded rod to increase torque.\r\n\r\n*technically, i love the non-diet, original recipe Coke; not the recommended  diet variety."
