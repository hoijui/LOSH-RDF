function = "This is a knob which should fit standard potentiometers of the larger variant, e.g. for audio stomp boxes. It is not perfect yet, but did it job to replace a broken one. Things to be fixed: the inner screw hole is to long and is not covered by the knob. The small indicator triangle to indicate the position did not come out very well on my print."
