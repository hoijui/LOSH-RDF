function = "The battery cover on our Keysonic wireless keyboard (http://www.ebuyer.com/product/104608) broke: the prongs failed resulting in a failed power, lost batteries and intense frustration.  So we printed a new, improved replacement cover.  Yes, 3d printing can produce something useful!\r\n\r\nThe original cover was recreated in qcad.  The areas that experience most strain were reinforced with ribs or by thickening, while the flexibility of the latch was increased by lengthening the slot in the cover.  After the second round of printing we had something robust, with a snug fit, that keeps the batteries in.\r\n\r\nOne risk of the current design is that the support buttresses for the prongs are quite fragile and can be torn off in the printing process.  This can result in malformed hooks, but in our case everything came out fine.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard cover was printed on a Stratasys Dimension 768 SST, with breakaway support material.  Feature resolution is 0.5mm."
