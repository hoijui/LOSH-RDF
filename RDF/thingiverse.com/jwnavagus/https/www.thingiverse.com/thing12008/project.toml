function = "Even Makerbot's mascot helps in the process of making.\r\nMTOMbot accepts filament 3/1.75 on top of its head exiting the bottom. The front and back medallions open to reveal supports for holding permanent markers for the coloring of filament. Is that blue just not green enough with two permanent markets? MTOMbots are made to stack so that filament can be doped with as much coloring as need. Extra extensions are available so that MTOMbots can stand head to toe or hold each other up for dual extruder duty for your coloring needs.\r\nDo you have a broken filament or would you like to join two different color filaments? MTOMbot is there for the rescue. Square off the ends of both filaments. Feed the ends through each one of MTOMbots hand attachements. Apply acetone to both ends using cue-tips and using MTOMBots hands as a guide push the two filaments together.\r\nThe plush MTOMbot will be available this Christmas.\r\nWhere did MTOMbots come from you ask? Just wait, the entire story will be revealed in a direct to YouTube movie from BLENDER of Blender.org\r\nGoodbye for now."
