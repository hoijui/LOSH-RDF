function = "A very simple copy of the kickstarter project Digispark PCB. Made with openscad.  \r\nDo not use this as a reference design. Design based on pictures of the PCB. Not measured dimensions.  \r\nNice to have already something in your hands.  \r\n\r\nUpdate:  \r\nOutline dimensions received from Erik Kettenburg. So they match the real board. Now we can start to make bumpers and cases.   \r\n\r\nFor other Digispark items like bumpers, cases etc see:  \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:41291"
