function = "I design and make my own fashion accessories and this is a cad file I use to 3D Print belts with nylon. The cad file is about 1000mm long.  It is 3d printed hollow in a spiral so you can print it on a small table like mine.  This will give you 2 belts.\r\nTo take the spiral out, you simply iron it on an ironing board like any other nylon accessory."
