function = "This is my simple purse and is a good place to start if you want to print different purse designs.\r\nIt is 200mm long 70mm wide and 110mm tall.  I draw these in my CAD with just the fillet and cage commands to move curves where I like them.  The best thing is the nylon feels like an expensive material but is very easy to clean."
