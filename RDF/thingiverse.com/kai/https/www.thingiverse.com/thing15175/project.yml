function: "I was looking for Acrylic Draw Design for standard 5mm thick acrylic.\r\nI also like to include some latest improvement from evanevery(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13261) such as stress relief and other holes for additional fan mount.\r\nHowever, evanevery's design is made for 5.5mm~5.9mm thickness board which won't work for standard 5mm board.\r\n\r\nSo, This drawing is designing for board thickness tolerance in 4.6mm~5.2mm. \r\n \r\nAll t-slot also have stress relief to prevent cracking under stress.\r\nI try to pack all small parts into the window to save the board usage."
