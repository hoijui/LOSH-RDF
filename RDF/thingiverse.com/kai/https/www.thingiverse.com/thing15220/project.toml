function = "My old MacBook Pro's battery is almost dead. So I need to keep power connector always on to prevent shutdown. So I make a holder to lock the MagSafe on my Mac.\r\n \r\n\r\nThis MagLock is inspired by MagStay (http://www.thoughtout.biz/products/MagStay-PRO.html)\r\n\r\nIt will prevent Mac MagSafe Power connector accidently disconnect.\r\n\r\nThe MagStay will occupy one USB port which makes it less practical to use.\r\n\r\nSo, I come up with MagLock which allow me to use the USB port next to the power connector."
