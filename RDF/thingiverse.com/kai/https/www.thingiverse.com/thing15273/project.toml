function = "I am building a new ToM and I just have 8mm rod and LM8UU leftover from my Prusa Mendal. So I design an adapter kit to convert Makerbot from using 3/8\" rod and bushing to 8mm rod and LM8UU linear bearing.\r\nIt will fit on standard wood ToM and work pretty well on my new acrylic tom too."
