function = "This is a in progress project that we try to use convention CNC mill/router as a 3D printer. Here, we use Mach3 control software which reads g-code and control the CNC movement. In this setup, we don't need to change the original setup and be able to switch CNC/printing jobs easily.\r\n\r\nThis work is created by Chin-Kai Chang, Rand Voorhies and Lior Elazary at University of Southern California(USC) iLab. http://ilab.usc.edu"
