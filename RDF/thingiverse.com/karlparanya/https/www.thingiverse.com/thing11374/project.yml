function: "This is not the most efficient way to make a rigid heddle loom, but it works.  There are definitely some parts that need some editing, the heddle needs to be stronger, as do the front and back round beams.  Also, the openSCAD files should be parameterized to accomodate any sized loom and heddle.\r\n\r\nThe loom took a lot of time/plastic to print and I don't expect anyone else to print it, but it was a great way to learn some openSCAD and to combine two of my hobbies."
