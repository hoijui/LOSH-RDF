Here is a short video:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWW5DFWcvhE\r\n\r\nThe wheels took some effort to loosen up after printing, but they now roll quite nicely on the right surface.\r\n\r\nOther problems:  \r\n\r\nThere is definitely some warping from the plastic cooling/shrinking (I used ABS).\r\n\r\nThe transition from the wheel to the axle is a bit steep for the makerbot."
