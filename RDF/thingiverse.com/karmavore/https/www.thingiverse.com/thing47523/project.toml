function = "If you find yourself wanting to raise your bed off of the LM8UU Y-Bushings in your mendel, you can use this thing to do it.\r\nA commenter wisely notes that this isn't technically necessary, because one could just move the y-smooth rods above the crossbar. This, however, sacrifices a non-trivial quantity of build volume on the z-axis.\r\nSo I created this for my switch from the two-build-plate design of the Prusa Mendel to the single-build-plate design approach, and I needed to get that single bed higher than the crossbars.\r\n\r\nMy thanks to Prusa and his y-bushing design, from which this item was derived. Thanks, too, to Triffid Hunter, whose bar clamp allowed me to make my spacer somewhat shorter."
