A commenter wisely notes that this isn't technically necessary, because one could just move the y-smooth rods above the crossbar. This, however, sacrifices a non-trivial quantity of build volume on the z-axis.\r
So I created this for my switch from the two-build-plate design of the Prusa Mendel to the single-build-plate design approach, and I needed to get that single bed higher than the crossbars.\r
\r
My thanks to Prusa and his y-bushing design, from which this item was derived. Thanks, too, to Triffid Hunter, whose bar clamp allowed me to make my spacer somewhat shorter.""" ;
