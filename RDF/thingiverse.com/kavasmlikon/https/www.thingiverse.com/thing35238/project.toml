function = "Do you need an enclosure for your RFID project? This is a tab-in-slot design for a laser cut box that you might want to use or re-appropriate for your needs.\r\n\r\n- dimensions are 150 x 150 x 50mm, fits an Arduino microcontroller with an Ethernet shield attached to it, as well as an RFID controller and antenna.\r\n- little base for the RFID antenna to sit right behind the front panel (+ extra base if you use the ID-20 rather than separated RFID controller and antenna)\r\n- pre-cutted PCB standoff holes for the Arduino and RFID controller\r\n- holes in the back of the box for a power adapter, Ethernet cable, and a piezzo-speaker for auditive feedback after a card was read\r\n- tab-in-slot design with cutouts for an Interlocking T-Bolt Construction to stabilize the box using 3mm x 10mm machine screws and 3mm nuts."
