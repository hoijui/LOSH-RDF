function: I was having trouble with print jobs not sticking to my Thing-O-Matic's heated build platform.  and read that reducing airflow (drafts) would help. So I cut plexi-glass windows to cover the openings on the sides and back of the TOM, and printed a set of these clips to hold them in place. Seems to help!
