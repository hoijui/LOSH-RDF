    okh:function """One of my USB sticks had a cover that broke open, so I made this! It's a from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17656, cleaned up, modified slightly, and smoothed in Blender. There's a hole in the top half of the model for fitting the innards of a USB stick, and the bottom half slips over the USB plug to form a cap.\r
\r
The USB stick sticks out slightly in the back, but I didn't want to slide the top half of the model forward because of stability reasons. I might make another version with the USB stick positioned slightly forward - I didn't do that originally because the walls were a bit thin in that position, but I'm sure with some modifications it could be made to work.""" ;
