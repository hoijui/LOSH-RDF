function = "The Prusa source has set of OpenSCAD files for using LM8UU linear bearings, which have 15mm diameter and 24mm length.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I got set of LME8UUs, which are ALMOST the same, except that they happen to be millimeter longer and thicker than LM8UUs - 16mm diameter and 25mm length.\r\n\r\nTrying to fit these in stock printed parts would not end well, so I hacked into bushing.scad to fix these dimensions. While doing that, I made them parametric, so that it would be possible to switch between these more easily."
