function = "A minimal filament spooling device, inspired by Nophead's Sky Hook\r\n\r\nI used white ABS for the spindle. It was designed to work with a 606 skate bearing but is easily scaled to fit any other bearing.\r\n\r\nThe basket is macrame. All it takes is 3 pieces of 90cm long string and a few knots. I have added a pic on how to make it."
