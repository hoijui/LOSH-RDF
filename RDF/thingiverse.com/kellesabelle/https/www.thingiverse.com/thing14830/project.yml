function: "I know there are plenty of these out there, but here's what I wanted:\r\n\r\nMounted on the Prusa: I didn't want to drill holes in my walls, and desk space is at a premium for now.  \r\n\r\nLow friction or otherwise set it and forget it-ish: The best success I had previous to this was leaving the spool on its side on the floor.  I had to check it from time to time but it usually worked out OK.\r\n\r\nSo really, nothing too crazy.  This is what I came up with.  It attaches to the z-mount instead of the regular clamp.  Works like a champ."
