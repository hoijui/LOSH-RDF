function = "This is for mounting an Airport extreme vertically on the wall.  \r\n\r\nI made a larger one and a smaller one.  I've tried my best to make it strong and not use and a ton of plastic.  I think it came out pretty well.  Currently printing the large version and its taking forever.  I'll post pictures of the final result when its done.\r\n\r\nI'm including the Solidworks Assembly file for anyone who might find it useful.  The parts are saved inside of it."
