function = "This is a portable laptop cart for schools, built to solve the problem of the standard Bretford carts not moving in and out of buildings, over bumps easily.  It is both difficult to move them since they are so heavy and dangerous (we even had one tip over!).  \r\n\r\nThe chassis for it is the All-Terrain Radio Flyer Wagon.  It pulls pretty easily and carries 18 computers."
