    okh:function """This is a library of OpenSCAD modules for mounting Arduino boards. It has modules for creating enclosures, bumpers, mounting holes, punch out holes for jacks like USB and power and board dimensions. If you are making a custom enclosure or are mounting an Arduino board to a larger project this should make it easier.   
Included is an example scad file and some stls of bumpers generated with the library.  The long term goal is to make this useful for a variety of boards not just Arduinos.  

This is version 2.0. If your looking for the original look the v1.0 release at my Github repository:  
https://github.com/kellyegan/Arduino-Mounting-OpenSCAD-Library  

The library uses tbuser's pin library for the pin mounts: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10541  

There are a number of great designs for individual Arduino board enclosures that I used for inspiration including:
