function = "I was trying to prototype a specialized chain for carrying pieces through a workflow.  It turned out that the chain works pretty well as a printed piece.  I'm working on converting the pieces into OPENSCAD so you'd be able to print any size link and the appropriate gear.  I'm also going to be hooking it up to an arduino, touchosc, processing combination to make something for the kids to play with (watch for details)."
