function = "This is a holder for kitchen dish towels. It attaches with the removable 3M Command Adhesive Strip - medium size. These strips are 'damage-free', easy to apply and removal.\r\n\r\nThese two pieces key together. By making it two pieces the mount has a flat surface for the adhesive. Additionally in this way, support is not needed.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for this was gregmarra's toothbrush holder (thingiverse.com/thing:15617) which was a derivation of dezbot's toothbrush holder (thing: 9056)"
