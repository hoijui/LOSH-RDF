\r
These two pieces key together. By making it two pieces the mount has a flat surface for the adhesive. Additionally in this way, support is not needed.\r
\r
The inspiration for this was gregmarra's toothbrush holder (thingiverse.com/thing:15617) which was a derivation of dezbot's toothbrush holder (thing: 9056)""" ;
