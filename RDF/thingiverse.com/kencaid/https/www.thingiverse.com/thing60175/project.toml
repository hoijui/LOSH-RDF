function = "This is an aid for individuals with limited grip strength. It angles the utensil for less wrist/elbow/shoulder rotation. \r\nAttach it to a spoon or a fork with a common rubber band. Right hand or left hand versions for utensil preference. With an eating utensil banded to the bottom, the thumb is inserted in the loop and a light grip allows for control. \r\nIn this way a person can eat without undue awkwardness. It can be applied to common flatware if the person is dining out. Print another if the busboy gets it."
