function = "This is an aid for rolling dice, in place of throwing or tossing them.  When playing a game with young children it may be easier than finding the dice after erratic rolls. At least the dice will be confined to a smaller area. \r\nFor people with manipulation issues it may be easier and more consistent than the throw-release motion."
