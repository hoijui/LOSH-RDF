function = "I found the roll top box really nice, and started thinking where else a rolling cover would be useful. I designed this enclosure for my Mintyboost. It allows you to swap out the AA batteries by rolling the cover around. Check out version 2 in the remix box for a more refined version that doesn't need a battery holder.  \n\n\n\nOverall size is 4.15\" long x 1.85\" wide x 0.83\" tall. The cover can continuously slide around the enclosure, it's kind of addicting!"
