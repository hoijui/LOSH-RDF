function = "Here's the newest version of the rolling MintyBoost Enclosure. I didn't like how hard it was to install/ remove the batteries, so I revised the design and got rid of the battery holder! The batteries are easier to remove now, and the cost is a little cheaper. I also updated the front pins to hold more securely."
