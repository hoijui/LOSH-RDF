function = "A small frame that holds Mini DV tape cases upright, 4 around, on to at least a 50 DVD spindle. with room for a few more disks.\r\n\r\nThe \"Full\" is a CD sized, cd thin disk. this one offers a suggestion of alignment, the tapes will topple if jostled. It uses more plastic, but it looks better.\r\n\r\nThe \"Less\" is a (better) trimmed down circle, much thicker, and small print bed friendly. The tapes are fairly rigidly upright.\r\n\r\n-\r\nThis is for easier archiving, as the computer backups are probably down to blue ray or DVD, but the master tapes still exist."
