function: "I merged Gargi's nema 17 back box mount and Eddima's side mounted fan into a top sitting X axis motor blower.\r\nThere isn't room (or weight allowance) for much on the printrbot head, but the extruder motor can run hot.\r\nThis is one general solution.\r\n\r\nThe mount is angled about 15 degrees and moves air at the extruder head motor level from the center to the near side.\r\n\r\nThis makes a decent bed fan if it is attached with the fan on the bed side, the slight angle blows into the middle of the bed. The distance makes a gentler breeze than a head mounted fan does.\r\n\r\nIt slides easily on and off the motor, but is heavy enough not to rattle.\r\n\r\nThe walls are much thicker on this model, there shouldn't be any thin wall problems.\r\n\r\nI have a 50mm 12 volt fan mounted. \r\n\r\nI used the fan mount from this\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24396"
