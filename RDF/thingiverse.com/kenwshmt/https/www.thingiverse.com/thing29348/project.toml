function = "Intended for modeling.\r\n\r\nSpacexula's nema 17 variation.\r\n\r\nThis one has negative holes where the pins are. they go all the way through.\r\n\r\n4mm version is friendly to 3mm fillament, it goes in without complaint. (first)\r\n\r\n3mm version probably fits mounting screws properly, or at least well enough to hold. (second)\r\n\r\npictured is 4mm with 3mm filament in it, intended for modeling, and i'm not going to use screws.\r\n\r\nThe center is still a bit large, I will add a replaceable insert for the motor so the attached gear rotates right, in the mean time, if you use a long strip, the bend of the filament alone will hold it in place."
