function: "Designed for modeling, or if you want to use filament instead of screws.\r\n\r\nIf you use the 3mm filament for anything but extrusion, you need to contain it.\r\n\r\nThese are snuggly fitting ends and rings to use 3mm in larger holes, or to make it lock outside of a smaller one.\r\nIt shouldn\xE2\u20AC\u2122t need any real cleanup.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tapered ring is the best for holding of them all.\r\n\r\nThe tapered versions don't taper very much, but may help self centering.\r\n\r\n3mmringtapered12.stl is a plate of 12.\r\n They come up best from a still heated bed, but expect to break 3 pealing them up, and 3 more pressing(hammering) filament into them.\r\nThey slide down filament easily, but the ends are always flaired from the cutting, and some force will be required to get them onto it.\r\n\r\nGlue to make permanent."
