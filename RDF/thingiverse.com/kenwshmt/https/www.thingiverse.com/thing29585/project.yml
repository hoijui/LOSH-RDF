function: "For Display.\r\n\r\nThis will hold a PrintRbot X assembly with the extruder upright on a table.\r\n\r\nIt has 2 pegs that are a bit smaller than the holes on the X carriage.The weight of the side motor will jam it upright.\r\n\r\nThe body is large, and has several faces that logos or text or labels could be used on.\r\n\r\nThis was its first print.\r\nI shouldn't have used the fan. I disabled it near the top and its fine from then on.\r\n\r\nPictured here is my all plastic Printrbot X carriage model which I will explain in another posting."
