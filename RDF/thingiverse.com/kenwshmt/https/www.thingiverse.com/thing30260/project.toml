function = "Model only, I needed the shape for design.\r\n\r\n$10 micro engraver that runs on 2 AAA batteries available from amazon, harbor freight, and Taiwan.\r\n\r\n2 versions: \r\n'noprint' is the complete model. It isn't unprintable, it's just beyond my printer, at least not without lots of support.\r\n\r\nThe other is in several pieces: the head,a body half segment, connector peg, and segment with peg.\r\n\r\nPrint the half twice, thats the battery compartment.\r\n\r\nI designed it to use 3 3mm filament segments in a triangle, glued. The connector peg is the same as using filament.\r\n\r\nI used this model to design a microengraver head mount. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30520"
