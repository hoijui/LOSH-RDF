It is approximatly the same place on the head as the engraver end would be. \r\nThe Z endstop modification works with it as well.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30590\r\n\r\nPRINT WITHOUT SUPPORT, or the marker wont fit. The little droop of the top bridge holds the marker in better.\r\n\r\nSharpie makes the circuit trace resist markers 'etch resist pen', this is what this fits. It is a standard sharpie design.\r\n\r\nThe marker comes in and out without removing the mount, so getting a cap onto it quickly isn't difficult.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be .4 wide, on paper.\r\n\r\nThanks to beardicus, and his good sharpie model. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15647\r\n\r\nPrintRbot laser mount thingiverse.com/thing:30064\r\n\r\nPrintRbot engraver mount thingiverse.com/thing:30520\r\n\r\nPrintRbot marker mount thingiverse.com/thing:30999\r\n\r\nPrintRbot Z end stop extender. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30590"
