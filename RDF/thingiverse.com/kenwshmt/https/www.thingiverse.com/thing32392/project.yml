function: "Model only.\r\nThis is the 'thick case' model for the 13.5 mm design.\r\n \r\nThis is larger in every dimension than the 808 mini camera.\r\n\r\nIt is intended as a model and as a negative for subtraction from other forms, to leave a hole.\r\n\r\nBe prepared to clean up for plastic shrinkage on your holes, it might be a tad small in the corners some times. Not consistently.\r\n\r\nTo be the same size as the 808, reduce it by about 2%.\r\n\r\nThe model with the base is high enough off the heat bed to avoid any curling strangeness. \r\nI suggest using the hex support, it comes off cleanest.\r\n\r\nThis is a Wades head mount for it. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32607\r\n\r\nThe '808 cam usb.stl' has a sufficiently large USB block to handle most mini usb plugs.\r\n\r\nThe hole half is a subtraction of the model from a form to see how well it fits, and it fits fine.\r\n\r\nPictures show the 808 next to the hole, in the hole, 808 in an early mount, the printed model in the same hole.\r\n\r\nThe hole half is half of the model subtracted from a rectangle, for anyone wanting to just mod that one. there is no USB block on there though, so you will need to remove the camera after its depleted its charge.\r\n\r\nThe simplest one is to modify the 'cammount1', that is below the USB connector, but beyond the lanyard hole, so that a stopper, I use a plastic toothpick, can be used to hold it in place. This holds securly without anchoring. \r\n\r\nA good site with details and examples of the 808 models.\r\nhttp://www.chucklohr.com/808/index.shtml \r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI have no connection to this model from ebay I link to.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/Mini-Hidden-Camera-Spy-Car-Key-Chain-DVR-Cam-Camcorder-Video-/120915336916?_trksid=p5197.m1997&_trkparms=aid%3D222002%26algo%3DSIC.FIT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D16%26meid%3D2817817423244987116%26pid%3D100016%26prg%3D1006%26rk%3D3%26sd%3D280964592240%26"
