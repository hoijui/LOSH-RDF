function: "Printrbot / Wades / Extruder Motor top attachment mount.\r\n\r\nThis is the top arm of the E body extruder trimmed and flipped.\r\nIt is shaped to be vertical, though not necessarily straight up, as motors are in different orientations.\r\n\r\nThis goes harmlessly and tightly into the open space of the E-body next to the gear, using the unused mounting hole of the Nema 17.\r\n\r\nIt is for small self contained attachments that are lite enough not to rattle.\r\n\r\nIf there is a concern of weight, then a counter balance could be added on the motor side.\r\n\r\nThe bottom is square in this design to accomodate any under mounts that might do better with a flat surface.\r\n\r\nIt can be hung down instead of upright, but there is no vibration dampening that you would get compressed onto the motor."
