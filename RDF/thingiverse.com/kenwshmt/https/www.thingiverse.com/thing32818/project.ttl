\r
This is high up on a raft to deminish curling, the down side is the inside.\r
\r
I extended the stem body, took the wicker out (sorry, it was simpler) and subtracted down the middle assuming the hinge faces make it straight. \r
\r
Using the 808-11 camera model to make a hole, you now have stereo glasses, if you use a camera in each stem.\r
\r

\r
Using one until its charge depletes then using the other can double your recording time.\r
\r
on the left stem, the camera fits snugly and is aligned down the back ear stem.\r
\r
Thr right stem still needs work.\r
\r
There is progress.. keep watching, I make at least 3 changes a week.\r
\r
I'm not really sure about this screw thing, i might enlarge the hinges to 3mm filament.""" ;
