function = "Who could resist a name like that?\r\n\r\nYou MUST have a crossbeam for this to work correctly.\r\n\r\nThe bed gets 18 degrees C warmer (64 F) than it was without it, and thatâ€™s with just a garbage bag.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful for fume trapping and exhausting as well.\r\n\r\nThread the hook of the hanger through the back hole (bottom), not the front one, and you have a small box tent frame. The corners are just about at the end of the Y travel. They angle out far enough to either side that straight down is beyond the side of the machine.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to fit a thin covering onto 7.5mm plastic shirt hangers over the machine for wider temperature range operations. \r\nIf you use yours like I do mine, in a cold garage.\r\nYou can use a light plastic bag, painterâ€™s plastic, garbage bag, beach towel, or a full bed sheet if you attach the corners further away.\r\n\r\nThese fit over the back of the cross beam blocks, and hold in place by compression. \r\nThey may need initial cleaning to get them on. The holes are 8mm wide, and you can use things other than plastic hangers.\r\n\r\nThere is a 'left' and 'right' version, but either one will fit over the other side, if turned around.\r\nIf you print one twice, print the left side one, as it around the front on the right side might not get in the way of the extruder.\r\n\r\nOne of the hanger mounts took a fair amount of cleaning to get it to fit over the cross beam mount, and I used channel lock pliers to square it up. Its on for good.\r\n\r\nThere are 'through' versions, that don't have the wall completely down one side, for extending bolts."
