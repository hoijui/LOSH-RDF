function: "This is a replacement or the TechZone Huxley's tip clamp, to use a J-Head hotend with your TechZone Huxley.\r\n\r\nBased on DeuxVis' remake of the tip clamp that was shared on http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?214,102464,155495#msg-155495 and measurements from the J-Head nozzle technical drawing on http://reprap.org/mediawiki/images/2/26/Jhn_nozzle_holder_v5.jpg.\r\n\r\nAs I understand the comments in the original scad by DeuxVis, he's happy for this to be used for anything as long as his comments remain there.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2012-10-28:\r\nFixed distance between holes, and thickened the bridge by the mount for increased rigidity. I've also tested a printed part, and it very snugly. The inner diameter of the groove mount ridge might need to be increased ever so slightly, to avoid bending the part backwards. A bit of sand paper will probably do the trick if it's too tight."
