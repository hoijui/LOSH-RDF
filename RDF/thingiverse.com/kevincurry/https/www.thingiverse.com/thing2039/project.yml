function: "I've always disliked the stock end caps that come with all Yakima roof rack cross-bars. This design fit the bill of a beefier end-cap while providing a handy loop to hook anything to (bungee cord, rope etc). I was amazed at how strong these are and VERY difficult to get off once you smack them on! They are 5.5cm x 3.5cm x 2.5cm tall (when on the build platform)  with nicely rounded edges, especially on the loop so as not to fray any tie-down materials (which made for more complicated polygons and a resulting large-ish .stl file)\r\n\r\nWe'll see how the UV's out here in Colorado treat them, also, it's cold here now, so we'll also see if there's any change in fit once summer rolls around - but it's always easy enough to print more if I have to!\r\n\r\nAs with anything, use at your own risk, but I've had great luck with them so far."
