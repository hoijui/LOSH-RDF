function = "A friend of mine needed a replacement window crank for his miata. \r\n\r\nI whipped this part up for him. \r\n\r\nIt features rounded edges, and some basic curving splines. \r\n\r\nThis crank should work for most cars that use a manual window crank. \r\n\r\nI needed to shorten this part a bit as compared to the original to accommodate the size of the makerbot. It's quite easy to scale the handle of the part larger in solidworks."
