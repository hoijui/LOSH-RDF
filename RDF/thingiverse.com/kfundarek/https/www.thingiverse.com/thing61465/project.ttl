    okh:function "This is a holder that is used to mount a Xbox Kinect to a tripod. I wanted to use the Kinect to scan a small object. I read from a number of people that you should mount the Kinect in a stationary position in order to obtain the best results when scanning small objects. I had an old tripod manufactured by Maxell, so I decided to  design a holder so that I could mount the kinect to it. There are two pieces to the mount. The larger one holds the Kinect's base while the smaller piece is used to attach it to the tripod." ;
