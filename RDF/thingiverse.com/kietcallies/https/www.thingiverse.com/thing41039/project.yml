function: "I wanted to observe and record my creations on my MakerBot Replicator, so I bought a Logitech C525 Webcam. The problem was finding a good place to mount it with a good viewing angle.\r\n\r\nI enclosed my MakerBot Replicator with an acrylic box on top (with corner blocks I designed and which I will post later) and panels on the front and sides, using these panel holders: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27895 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27865. Then I came up with the idea of mounting this platform I designed in SketchUp to the front acrylic panel."
