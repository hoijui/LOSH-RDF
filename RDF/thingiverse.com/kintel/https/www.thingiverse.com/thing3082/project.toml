function = "Inspired by the Loft Bed Cup Holder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1543, I designed this hanging shelf.\r\nDue to a slightly aggressive bedroom space optimization project, I don't have space for a bed side table on my side of the bed. Having my phone lying on the floor makes it just a tiny bit hard to grope for it when the alarm goes off. This will bring the phone within better reach, plus it also leaves room for my reading glasses."
