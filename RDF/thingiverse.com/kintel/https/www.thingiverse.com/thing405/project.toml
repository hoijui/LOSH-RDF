function = "This is V2 of my twisted star box.\r\nThe model is now almost fully parametrized, making it possible to change parameters like base radius, height, base/lid ratio, number of edges in the star and regenerate the geometry from within Art of Illusion.\r\n\r\nTo regenerate/edit the model, our under development and undocumented MetaCADEvaluator plugin is needed. This is part of the development version of CSGEvaluator for Art of Illusion:\r\nhttp://objects.reprap.org/wiki/Builders/Metalab/AoI_CSG_Evaluator\r\n\r\nNotice how the AoI file is only 12kb while the stl version totals ca. 5mb."
