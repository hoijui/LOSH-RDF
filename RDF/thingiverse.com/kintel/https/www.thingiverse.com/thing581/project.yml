function: "Just a quick shotglass modelled with our parametric AoI plugin.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple model, but I uploaded it for the story:\r\nPhilipp, Bre, Zach and I brought one of their MakerBots to a bar in NYC. While sitting there printing objects and drinking Sangria, I quickly tossed together this model and printed it.\r\nThe bartender got impressed enough to give us all a tequila shot on the house, of course drunk from the printed glass!\r\n\r\n\r\nTo regenerate/edit the model, our under development and undocumented MetaCADEvaluator plugin is needed. This is part of the development version of CSGEvaluator for Art of Illusion:\r\nobjects.reprap.org/wiki/Builders/Metalab/AoI_CSG_Evaluator"
