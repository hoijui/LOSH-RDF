function: "I went to the Cupcake Social 2.0 event in NYC on May 7, and won this awesome pink apron in their raffle.\r\nBeing an avid cupcake baker and just loving pink clothing, this was the perfect opportunity for making my long-term vision of being able to bake cupcakes while tweeting my progress in real-time finally becoming a reality.\r\n\r\nSo here I present: The Keyboard Cupcake Apron.\r\n\r\nThe design was inspired by Zach\\'s keyboard pants:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:589.\r\nAlso thanks to Zach for giving me his leftover keyboard!\r\n\r\nFor more images, see http://www.flickr.com/photos/kintel/sets/72157618070732209/"
