function = "This is my entry to MakerBot Mascot competition. Transformer.\r\n\r\nI've spend a lot of time designing this buddy just to make it perfect. I hope this time was not just wasted.\r\n\r\nI tried to make him as close to what I thought would be a perfect MakerBot. It simply transforms from the Maker mode into the Bot mode. It is technological enough as well as very friendly and helpful little guy. He is not aggressive looking as transformers usually are, and at the same time he has some strong robotic personality which preserves his outlook underpinning the idea of what is technically complex MUST be user-friendly and affordable to everyone.\r\n\r\nUPD(27.09.2011): Uploaded new version with the correct MakerBot font. Thanks to http://www.thingiverse.com/nycdesigner!\r\n\r\nUPD(28.09.2011): Uploaded new version with corrections (leg logo attachment, and some minor overhangs in body part)"
