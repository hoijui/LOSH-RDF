function = "Here is my entry to MakerBot Mascot Competition.\r\n\r\nThe story behind this guy is quite simple:\r\n'M' is a very cute chap with an extraordinary power. His superpower always contradicts with his friendliness, because he tries to be helpful to anyone he meet. He thinks nobody takes him seriously but at the same time he is doing great and everybody appreciate that.\r\n\r\nI think his personality suits MakerBot a lot together with main features of the company captured in the Bot such as: Small but powerful, very affordable to anyone, very friendly and open, superstrong but cute, ant yet there is a great amount of self-irony in him :)"
