function: "Basically it is the same puzzle but it is much easier for cut, Because it is small and everything is 4mm thick. The 3D SW2010 file is also attached so you could play around it.\r\n\r\nNOTE: On the pictures of the real thing there is an old version, now it is modified and much more suitable for the lasercut with this foam material."
