function = "Since the previous box (4x4 x2) doesn't print quite well on a ToM HBP, designing a smaller box seems a better use of time (than tinkering with curl issues).\r\n\r\nThis box holds 8 pieces per layer (2x4), stacked 4 pieces high.  While still reaching the edge of the platform, the corners of the box stay well inside the evenly heated area and so shouldn't curl.\r\n\r\nSince the box is smaller, the text on the lid now isn't surrounded by so much empty space."
