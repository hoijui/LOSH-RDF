function = "This is a plugin for Adobe Illustrator (CS3, Windows) to export paths (and only straight-line paths!) to an OpenSCAD file.\r\n\r\nSince Illustrator CS3 (and higher) exports only DXF R13+, it'll generate POLYLINE and other objects, which OpenSCAD does not support.  By using this export plugin, you'll be able to use the path directly as a polygon().\r\n\r\n(Supposedly CS3 plugins are loadable with CS4 and CS5.)"
