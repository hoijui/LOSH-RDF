function = "A (parametric) buckle that you can attach to your camera strap, which lets you (hopefully) stop losing your lens cap.\r\n\r\nThe STL is sized for a 58mm lens cap, and a ~40mm strap width.\r\n\r\nThe printing layers make for a great friction catch for the lens cap.  But there's a designed-in lip overhang to make it a little more aggressive."
