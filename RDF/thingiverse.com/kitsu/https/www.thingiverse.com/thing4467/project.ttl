\r

\r
Poof -> thing\r
\r
It took several revisions. At first I built everything perfectly square/round and to the exact numbers I had measured. That didn't work out at all though. I kept poking and pulling and bending it with the proportional edit tool in Blender though and finally got a design that would print.""" ;
