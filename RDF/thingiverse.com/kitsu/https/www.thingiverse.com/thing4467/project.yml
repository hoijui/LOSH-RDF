function: "My first thing. A MoleSkeine pen holder.\r\n\r\nI needed something to sketch out some design ideas, so I dug this old notepad out of the bottom of my pack. I've got this pen I like sketching with too. There doesn't seem to be a good way to keep the pen and the pad together though, so...\r\n\r\nPoof -> thing\r\n\r\nIt took several revisions. At first I built everything perfectly square/round and to the exact numbers I had measured. That didn't work out at all though. I kept poking and pulling and bending it with the proportional edit tool in Blender though and finally got a design that would print."
