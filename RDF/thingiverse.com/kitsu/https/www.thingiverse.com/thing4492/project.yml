function: "Here is a model of a cheapo servo that I made a while ago. I actually used this in a computer model of a (flimsy) robot arm I had made. I had most of a simulation hacked togther in Blender before i abandoned the project. I might pick it up again now that I can print a proper arm!\r\n\r\nI made this back when I was exclusivly using Imperial units, and before I had my calipers. The parts all seemed close to some fraction of an inch though?"
