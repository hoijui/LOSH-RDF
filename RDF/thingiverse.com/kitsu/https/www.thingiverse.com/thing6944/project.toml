function = "Due to my mistrust of my heavily modified Makerbot, and considering some of the experiments I'm planning, I decided I needed a fire extinguisher close at hand. I found a reasonably priced unit in a aerosol can form factor that should work perfectly, but it didn't come with a mounting system...\r\n\r\nI think this mount will work for any standard aerosol can i.e. spray paint, spray lube, etc. The clip part is a little loose around the can."
