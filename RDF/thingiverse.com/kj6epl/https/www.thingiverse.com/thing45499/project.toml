function = "This is a replacement side panel for the Tenergy TB6AC universal charger that includes an improved 25mm fan mount. This is a great $70 charger available at Fry's for all Lithium, Pb, Ni-Cd, and Ni-MH batteries. The stock side plate includes a cutout for the fan, but nothing standard will fit (probably the reason no fan is included)."
