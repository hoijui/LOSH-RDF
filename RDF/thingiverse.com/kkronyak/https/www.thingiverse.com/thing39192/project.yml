function: "This design is for a parametric modular rolling cookie cutter device.  With this, and a little preparation work, you can make a rolling cookie cutter out of just about any 2d sketch!  The size of the cookie cutter, drum diameter and number of cutters are all configurable, among other things.  All you need to do is make a DXF file from your drawing, use a profile SCAD file to tweak the position, size etc. and render.\r\n\r\nThis design is completely original.  All examples except for the Circles and Squares which use OpenSCAD primitive shapes were hand drawn and scanned by my artist friend Valerie!  Unfortunately I have not been able to create a physical copy of this yet as my 3d printer hasn't arrived yet but I hope to be able to do so soon.\r\n\r\nThis design can also be used as an example of wrapping a flat object around a cylinder.  See the hSlice module for how that works.\r\n\r\nThis is my entry into the ProtoParadigm Winter Wonderland Contest.  Check out their site at www.protoparadigm.com -- I ordered my initial filament from their and their customer service is great!"
