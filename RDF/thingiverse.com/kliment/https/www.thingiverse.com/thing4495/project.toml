function = "A prusajr Mendel printable on a Makerbot or Huxley or any other small printer. Requires 85x98mm of active area. Bushings are included in a separate file and must be printed in PLA. The rest can be printed in either PLA or ABS. The vertices are stacked with a raft between them so they should separate easily. UPDATE! All plates updated to have more evenly distributed print times and latest version of all parts. Source is at https://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel"
