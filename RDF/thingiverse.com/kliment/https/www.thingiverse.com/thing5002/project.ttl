    okh:function """Final update: I have uploaded the source scad and DXF files, and an archive with all the STLs, including the improved ones by nicholasclewis (thank you!). I lost some of the source files for the first models by accident, and the bunny idler was not made in OpenSCAD, and I don't have the source for models made by others, but most of them are there. Have fun building, and don't forget the contest!\r
\r
Starting today, December 2nd, I will upload a new STL each day. Print one per day and you'll have a Prusa Mendel (with extruder) on the 24th. The prints that take longer are on the weekends, with shorter ones during the week. Some of the parts are special holiday-themed. I'll try to arrange them so you can build as much as possible with the ones you already have. All of these will fit on a normal Makerbot build platform. For more information on the Prusa Mendel, see http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel\r
\r
For the source code for the models, see https://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel\r

Superlative update! Ruben (sikko on IRC) of ikmaak.nl is organizing a contest for everyone who is printing this. The best resulting printer gets a free set of electronics, and the runner-up gets free filament. So if you are printing this, check http://ikmaak.nl/eenblog/2010/12/06/the-holiday-mendel-build-contest/ for the contest details.\r
\r
The STL for 02. December is now available.\r
It's a Wade extruder idler by nophead, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3462\r
\r
The STL for 03. December is now available.\r
It's three of the universal rod clamps that you need for the Y and Z axes.\r
The snowflakes are from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1321\r
You can hang them from your frame top bars if you like.\r
This is the Prusa Mendel bar-clamp part.\r
\r
The STL for 04. December is now available.\r
If you can have a vertex with a foot...\r
then why not have a vertex...with a boot!\r
This part is equivalent to frame-vertex-foot in the Prusa Mendel\r
\r
The STL for 05. December is now available.\r
The irregularly shaped hole on the y motor bracket just got more regular.\r
This is equivalent to the y-motor-bracket\r
\r
The STL for 06. December is now available.\r
Courtesy of GregFrost, we have a decorated vertex that proudly proclaims the name of the remix's designer. Print as it is, and don't worry about the missing bits on the first layer - they're there on purpose.\r
This is equivalent to the frame-vertex.\r
\r
The STL for 07. December is now available.\r
For all of you who were waiting for the other shoe to drop - here it is.\r
Should print better than the one before - less of the boot is hanging in the air.\r
This is equivalent to frame-vertex-foot.\r
\r
The STL for 08. December is now available.\r
This is a tree-star vertex. While the front of your bot has boots, why not have something nice for the back too?\r
This is equivalent to frame-vertex-foot.\r
\r
Once you've printed this part you are ready to assemble one of the frame triangles. Take this part and the one from the day before it, and the crown vertex, and follow the instructions on the wiki page linked above.\r
\r
The STL for 09. December is now available.\r
We've already got bar-clamps, why not star-clamps?\r
Sadly the thumbnail does not show the most interesting bit.\r
This is the Prusa Mendel bar-clamp part. \r
\r
The STL for 10. December is now available.\r
Another lovely vertex by GregFrost. Print as it is, and don't worry about the missing bits on the first layer - they're there on purpose and spell out the model name.\r
This is equivalent to the frame-vertex.\r
\r
The STL for 11. December is now available.\r
Another tree-star vertex. \r
This is equivalent to frame-vertex-foot.\r
\r
You can now build the entire frame! Have fun!\r
\r
The STL for 12. December is now available.\r
It's a gift and motor holder. It holds your z motor and a bunch of gifts - and anything else you put on it. Using clothbot's parametric LEGO buttons at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1005 makes this part LEGO-compatible.\r
This is equivalent to z-motor-holder.\r
\r
The STL for 13. December is now available.\r
Since the LEGO bits from yesterday turned out so popular, here's more of that.\r
Four belt clamps, two rod clamps, two bar clamps. Enjoy!\r
(There was an error in this file. If you downloaded it before this message appeared, please download it again. If you already printed it, you will need to reprint it. Sorry! My mistake!)\r
\r
The STL for 14. December is now available.\r
These are the prusa bushings. They work best if printed in PLA, so if you have access to PLA, use that for this part.\r
These are the bushings for all three axes.\r
\r
The STL for 15. December is now available.\r
These are pulleys for the X and Y axes. Use the shooting star pulley on the X axis, and the other on the Y.\r
\r
You can now build the entire Y axis.\r
\r
The STL for 16. December is now available.\r
This is a quiet little street behind a purring Z axis motor.\r
This is equivalent to z-motor-holder.\r
\r
The STL for 17. December is now available.\r
Two little trees to hold your leadscrews in line.\r
This is equivalent to coupling.\r
\r
The STL for 18. December is now available.\r
tbuser's lovely scanned gnome http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4693 finds its way back to the real world, guarding your x axis motor.\r
This is equivalent to x-end-motor.\r
\r
The STL for 19. December is now available.\r
I was so impressed when the Stanford bunny appeared on thingiverse as http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3731 and immediately printed 4.\r
This one will sit on your idler and watch your prints for you.\r
This is equivalent to x-end-idler.\r
\r
Now you have all the parts you need to build the X axis and attach it to the Z axis.\r
\r
The STL for 20. December is now available.\r
It's an x-carriage...with a beard. More on this theme later.\r
\r
You can now attach the bushings and belt for the X axis.\r
\r
The STL for 21. December is now available.\r
This is the small gear for a Wade's extruder - with a candy cane on top.\r
\r
The STL for 22. December is now available.\r
This is the body of Wade's extruder, only with a hat!\r
(could you, would you, with a hat?)\r
\r
The STL for 23. December is now available.\r
This is the large gear for the the Wade's extruder. It's meant to look pretty cool with the other extruder parts and the bearded carriage.\r
Moustache profile from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4626\r
\r
You can now assemble the entire extruder.\r
\r
The STL for 24. December is now available.\r
These are the endstop holder sleighs.\r
Racing through the bed.\r
On a one-stop open axis.\r
Who will reach it first...\r
At G28.\r
\r
You can now assemble the entire printer. Tomorrow, you get OpenSCAD source and a zip of all the models.""" ;
