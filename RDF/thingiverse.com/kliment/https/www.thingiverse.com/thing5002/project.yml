function: "Final update: I have uploaded the source scad and DXF files, and an archive with all the STLs, including the improved ones by nicholasclewis (thank you!). I lost some of the source files for the first models by accident, and the bunny idler was not made in OpenSCAD, and I don't have the source for models made by others, but most of them are there. Have fun building, and don't forget the contest!\r\n\r\nStarting today, December 2nd, I will upload a new STL each day. Print one per day and you'll have a Prusa Mendel (with extruder) on the 24th. The prints that take longer are on the weekends, with shorter ones during the week. Some of the parts are special holiday-themed. I'll try to arrange them so you can build as much as possible with the ones you already have. All of these will fit on a normal Makerbot build platform. For more information on the Prusa Mendel, see http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel\r\n\r\nFor the source code for the models, see https://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel\r\n\r\nSuperlative update! Ruben (sikko on IRC) of ikmaak.nl is organizing a contest for everyone who is printing this. The best resulting printer gets a free set of electronics, and the runner-up gets free filament. So if you are printing this, check http://ikmaak.nl/eenblog/2010/12/06/the-holiday-mendel-build-contest/ for the contest details.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 02. December is now available.\r\nIt's a Wade extruder idler by nophead, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3462\r\n\r\nThe STL for 03. December is now available.\r\nIt's three of the universal rod clamps that you need for the Y and Z axes.\r\nThe snowflakes are from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1321\r\nYou can hang them from your frame top bars if you like.\r\nThis is the Prusa Mendel bar-clamp part.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 04. December is now available.\r\nIf you can have a vertex with a foot...\r\nthen why not have a vertex...with a boot!\r\nThis part is equivalent to frame-vertex-foot in the Prusa Mendel\r\n\r\nThe STL for 05. December is now available.\r\nThe irregularly shaped hole on the y motor bracket just got more regular.\r\nThis is equivalent to the y-motor-bracket\r\n\r\nThe STL for 06. December is now available.\r\nCourtesy of GregFrost, we have a decorated vertex that proudly proclaims the name of the remix's designer. Print as it is, and don't worry about the missing bits on the first layer - they're there on purpose.\r\nThis is equivalent to the frame-vertex.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 07. December is now available.\r\nFor all of you who were waiting for the other shoe to drop - here it is.\r\nShould print better than the one before - less of the boot is hanging in the air.\r\nThis is equivalent to frame-vertex-foot.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 08. December is now available.\r\nThis is a tree-star vertex. While the front of your bot has boots, why not have something nice for the back too?\r\nThis is equivalent to frame-vertex-foot.\r\n\r\nOnce you've printed this part you are ready to assemble one of the frame triangles. Take this part and the one from the day before it, and the crown vertex, and follow the instructions on the wiki page linked above.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 09. December is now available.\r\nWe've already got bar-clamps, why not star-clamps?\r\nSadly the thumbnail does not show the most interesting bit.\r\nThis is the Prusa Mendel bar-clamp part. \r\n\r\nThe STL for 10. December is now available.\r\nAnother lovely vertex by GregFrost. Print as it is, and don't worry about the missing bits on the first layer - they're there on purpose and spell out the model name.\r\nThis is equivalent to the frame-vertex.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 11. December is now available.\r\nAnother tree-star vertex. \r\nThis is equivalent to frame-vertex-foot.\r\n\r\nYou can now build the entire frame! Have fun!\r\n\r\nThe STL for 12. December is now available.\r\nIt's a gift and motor holder. It holds your z motor and a bunch of gifts - and anything else you put on it. Using clothbot's parametric LEGO buttons at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1005 makes this part LEGO-compatible.\r\nThis is equivalent to z-motor-holder.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 13. December is now available.\r\nSince the LEGO bits from yesterday turned out so popular, here's more of that.\r\nFour belt clamps, two rod clamps, two bar clamps. Enjoy!\r\n(There was an error in this file. If you downloaded it before this message appeared, please download it again. If you already printed it, you will need to reprint it. Sorry! My mistake!)\r\n\r\nThe STL for 14. December is now available.\r\nThese are the prusa bushings. They work best if printed in PLA, so if you have access to PLA, use that for this part.\r\nThese are the bushings for all three axes.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 15. December is now available.\r\nThese are pulleys for the X and Y axes. Use the shooting star pulley on the X axis, and the other on the Y.\r\n\r\nYou can now build the entire Y axis.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 16. December is now available.\r\nThis is a quiet little street behind a purring Z axis motor.\r\nThis is equivalent to z-motor-holder.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 17. December is now available.\r\nTwo little trees to hold your leadscrews in line.\r\nThis is equivalent to coupling.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 18. December is now available.\r\ntbuser's lovely scanned gnome http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4693 finds its way back to the real world, guarding your x axis motor.\r\nThis is equivalent to x-end-motor.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 19. December is now available.\r\nI was so impressed when the Stanford bunny appeared on thingiverse as http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3731 and immediately printed 4.\r\nThis one will sit on your idler and watch your prints for you.\r\nThis is equivalent to x-end-idler.\r\n\r\nNow you have all the parts you need to build the X axis and attach it to the Z axis.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 20. December is now available.\r\nIt's an x-carriage...with a beard. More on this theme later.\r\n\r\nYou can now attach the bushings and belt for the X axis.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 21. December is now available.\r\nThis is the small gear for a Wade's extruder - with a candy cane on top.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 22. December is now available.\r\nThis is the body of Wade's extruder, only with a hat!\r\n(could you, would you, with a hat?)\r\n\r\nThe STL for 23. December is now available.\r\nThis is the large gear for the the Wade's extruder. It's meant to look pretty cool with the other extruder parts and the bearded carriage.\r\nMoustache profile from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4626\r\n\r\nYou can now assemble the entire extruder.\r\n\r\nThe STL for 24. December is now available.\r\nThese are the endstop holder sleighs.\r\nRacing through the bed.\r\nOn a one-stop open axis.\r\nWho will reach it first...\r\nAt G28.\r\n\r\nYou can now assemble the entire printer. Tomorrow, you get OpenSCAD source and a zip of all the models."
