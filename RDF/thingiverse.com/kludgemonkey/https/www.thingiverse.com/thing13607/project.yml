function: "I designed this part to adapt the spools I purchased from Makerbot to rotate freely on a 1\" piece of conduit. This is not a ball type bearing, but functions quite well as a bearing by interfacing two hard surfaces (ABS and metal in my case)through a knife edge.\r\n\r\nI found that when I simply hung the spools on the 1\" conduit they hung off-axis and the Stepstruder did not have the torque to rotate the eccentrically mounted spool. Simply adding this adapter to re-center the spool solved the problem and it feeds beautifully.\r\n\r\nOriginally I just built the adapter, but I found on long builds that the spool tended to \"walk\" off. I added an end piece to hold the spool on and used a couple of small screws I had available to fasten it in place.\r\n\r\nThe parts are designed to minimize the amount of ABS used. All walls are designed to be 0.125\" and I cut a number of holes out of the hold piece simply to reduce waste.\r\n\r\nThe picture makes the adapter look like a big fat cylinder, but in fact only the ends are actually 1\" internal diameter (ID). There is a small 45 degree solid to create the adaptation from 1\" ID to the outside diameter so that it only contacts the conduit in two small knife-edge places."
