function = "This fun little thing allows you to attach a standard 1/4 NPT air hose quick disconnect to a 2 Liter Bottle. This allows one to print out a very easy way to pressurize and launch soda (or pop) bottles of various sizes. Based on my research they have a standardized cap size, except for water bottles which seem non-standard. (The pictured bottle is obviously not a 2 L, but the threads are identical)\r\n\r\nThe quick disconnect becomes your nozzle, an easy way to apply gas and also a simple way to release the rocket for launch.\r\n\r\nApparently there is more than one definition for \"Bottle Rocket\", perhaps a more accurate term is \"Water Rocket\". The following link does not work properly because it includes a parenthesis, copy the entire line into your browser address bar: \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_rocket_(model)\r\n\r\nI intend to test out various launch mechanisms and post the information at to how best to make one out of readily available materials.\r\n\r\nI also intend to create a derivative that has fins and/or can accept fins."
