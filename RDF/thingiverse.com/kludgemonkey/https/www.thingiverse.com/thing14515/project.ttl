    okh:function """Today I decided to hang my icicle lights on the house. Step one was to spend 3 hours with the 3D printer making clips so that I could quickly mount the lights on the gutter. That said I'm incredibly pleased with how revision 3 turned out.\r
\r
I purchased the 12' icicle lights at Sam's http://www.samsclub.com/sams/shop/product.jsp?productId=prod3600087&searchTerm=icicle%20lights they have multiple strands of wire wound together. I designed the clip so that I could pre-install them on the wire then hang them from the gutter. The gutter I have has a 0.7" wide lip on top and then bends together.\r
\r
The point of the story is, these clips work amazingly for my gutter and the lights I'm hanging and I hope they work great for yours, but I suggest trying it first.""" ;
