function: An easier-to-use printable idler bushing. Unlike the other designs available, this one does not require you to disassemble your machine. GregFrosts's version is better if you have not built your machine yet, but this is an acceptable substitute if you are having problems with belt binding and don't feel like completely disassembling your machine.
