    okh:function """UPDATE: A New updated version of MendelMax is available at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20355. It is recommended for all new builds.\r
\r
MendelMax is a new RepRap 3d printer designed by Maxbots. It is a true reprap, using printed brackets, but instead of using threaded rod for the structural elements it uses inexpensive aluminum extrusions. This gives a huge increase in rigidity for a minimal extra cost (Self sourcing will cost about $50 more than a standard Prusa when purchased from the recommended suppliers). The required extrusions are available world wide from a variety of suppliers.\r
\r
In addition to greatly increased rigidity, this design is faster to assemble (probably 4 hours for most users), easier to print, has a larger build volume (~215x235x190 if built at the standard dimensions), and is easier to hack on.\r
\r
Update 2/7/2012: MendelMax full kits and hardware only kits are now available from Maxbots (aka Kludgineer on Thingiverse) @ http://store.mendelmax.com!""" ;
