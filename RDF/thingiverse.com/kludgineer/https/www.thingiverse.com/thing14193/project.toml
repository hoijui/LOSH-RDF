function = "This is a prototype X axis design for Makerslide. Note: This is untested and honestly is not recommended. It was a preliminary design and will require changes to work reliably, but you can use it if you want. \r\n\r\nThis is listed as for a MendelMax, but it is compatible with a Prusa Mendel as well.\r\n\r\nNote that at present this mounts the hot end off center, so you need to mount your table off center to get the full use of your Y axis. This will be changed in a future version."
