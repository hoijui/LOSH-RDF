function: "An updated version of the MendelMax 3d Printer. Nearly every printed part on the bot has been updated to make the assembly easier and faster and the printer more accurate. \r\n\r\nMajor upgrades include easier to assemble lower vertexes, Lower mounted Z motor mounts, an improved Y axis belt tensioner system, and easy to align Z axis smooth rod mounts. \r\n\r\nNOTE: While I do not consider this a work in progress, it is still not widely tested. I recommend this design even for new users, but if you prefer a rock solid well tested design you may prefer the original MendelMax."
