function = "These x ends are designed to minimize Z axis binding. They do that by adding a second set of bushings into the X axis idler. These bushings allow the X shafts to move a small amount in the X direction while remaining rigid in the Y & Z directions. This allows the distance between the two x-ends to increase and decrease as the height changes, helping to minimize Z axis binding. \r\n\r\nNote: The leadscrews these weere designed to be compatible with are no longer available. You can still use these with a printable nut adapter such as these: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23326"
