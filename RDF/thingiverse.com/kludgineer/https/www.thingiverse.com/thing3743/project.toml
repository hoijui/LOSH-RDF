See the comments below for the recommended alternative.\r\n\r\nA breakout shield to allow driving a RepRap from an Arduino Mega using Pololu's stepper drivers. Based on a design by JohnnyR (http://reprap.org/wiki/Arduino_Mega_Pololu_Shield).\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: This board has not yet been tested! I believe it works, but no guarantees are made!\r\n\r\nThis board is sized to allow inexpensive production from Seeedstudio (Currently 10 copies for $40 + a small shipping fee):\r\nhttp://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-2-layer-10cm10cm-max-10pcs-p-396.html?cPath=64_12\r\n\r\nThis is perfect for a different sort of crowd-sourcing: Buy 10, use one and keep a spare, but sell the rest on ebay for a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nI have no affiliation, but have ordered boards from them in the past."
