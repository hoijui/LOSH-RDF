function = "Just a minor refinement to the standard Wade's Extruder. In the normal configuration, the screws that mount the extruder are inaccessible when the stepper motor is installed. This version adds inset hexes to capture a standard M5 bolt head (or nut), making installation simple.\r\n\r\nThis is the extruder block only, download the other parts from the original Wade's extruder page."
