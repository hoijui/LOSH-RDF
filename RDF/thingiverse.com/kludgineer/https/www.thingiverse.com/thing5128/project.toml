function = "A printable air filter to remove ABS fumes from your enclosed 3d printer chamber. Print two copies with zero solid surface layers, 3 or so shell layers, and relatively sparse infill to allow plenty of airflow. \r\n\r\nFill each piece with activated charcoal, assemble the two pieces and attach to a 92mm fan. \r\n\r\nThis is currently untested, but I believe this should work fine. How effective it is remains to be seen, but it should remove at least some of the ABS fumes."
