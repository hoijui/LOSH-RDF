function = "Simplify cutting the rods for your next bot or other project. Simply clamp your rod in a vise between two of these jigs and cut with a hacksaw. \r\n\r\nSince the rod is supported on both sides of your cut the cut goes much faster and easier. Also, since the rod is clamped in plastic, you don't risk damaging it with excess clamping force. \r\n\r\nTested with rods between 5 and 12mm. 12mm is almost too large, but is manageable with care."
