function = "1:100 scale model of the International Space Station.  3D models were created using AutoDesk Inventor using sizes in Inches and exported to .stl files.  Models came from the NASA website at\r\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/multimedia/scalemodel/index.html\r\n\r\nI DO NOT recommend printing these files as they are.  Have fun with them, tweak them, etc.  I need to redesign them to make them 3D print friendly."
