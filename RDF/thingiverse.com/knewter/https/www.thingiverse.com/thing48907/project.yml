function: "Trying to make a pyro from descent.  Based on the d3 model 3 up found here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/into-cerberon/images/pyro-gx-3-view\r\n\r\nThe blender file is attached as well.  This is my first print from a blender file I made myself, so I'm still trying to figure out good thicknesses, etc."
