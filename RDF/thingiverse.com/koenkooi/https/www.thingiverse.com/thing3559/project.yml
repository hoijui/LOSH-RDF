function: "After shorting out yet another board I decided to make some coasters to protect my revision B and revision C beagleboards. It took me a few hours to get the hang of openscad and then tweak the dimensions to account for ABS shrinkage, but it's finally working.\r\n\r\nWith a 3mm edge thickness this maxed out my buildarea using a makergear bighead, the stock nozzle might have a bit more clearance.\r\n\r\nSupport for the slightly bigger beagleboard-xM will follow later once I have countersunk the bolts on my platform, it's too big to print otherwise.\r\n\r\nUpdate: upload version for beagleboard-xM\r\n\r\nThe most up to date version is kept at http://gitorious.org/hacks/things/trees/master"
