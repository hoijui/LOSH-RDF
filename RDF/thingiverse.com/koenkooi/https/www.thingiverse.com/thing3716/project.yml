function: "From Tony Busers original thing:\r\n\r\nThis is a grooved insulator retainer/mount for a MakerBot plastruder. This is for MakerGear makergear.com/products/nozzle style grooved insulators. (Pictured here is one I got from Brian Reifsnyder reprapstores.com/catalog/extruder-parts/machined-parts/tb-hybrid1g who also sells them and should have the same specs)\r\n\r\nThe idea is with a grooved insulator, you don't need the big washer to attach your barrel. You just slide it into the slot then slide the horizontal bolt to keep it in place. The bolt may not even be required depending on how tightly it fits.\r\n.\r\nThis derivative uses the other 2 bolt holes (the symetrical ones). The most up to date version of this can be found at http://gitorious.org/hacks/things"
