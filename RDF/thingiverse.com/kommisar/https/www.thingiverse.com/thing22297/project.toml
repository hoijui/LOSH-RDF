function = "The design is a version of the great fan block from timmytool. \r\n\r\nIt has some additional features like:\r\n- fan ejection nozzles on both sides of the MK7 heater. It provides more even airflow over the printing area and MK7 radiator;\r\n- wider ejection nozzles. Again, more air out - better cooling;\r\n- optional connection to additional air supply (compressor) for delicate prints."
