function: "PROBLEM!  Your totally sweet bike does not currently emit enough light to allow you to ride in the dark without endangering yourself and/or your aformentioned totally sweet ride.  What to do?\r\n\r\nWell, there are a number of options open to you: you could hoard radium and staple it to your pedals, but that might cause things to glow in situations where it's not appropriate (for instance, secret missions).  Glow sticks can be tough to find in a pinch, and taste horrible.  Purpose-built bicycle headlamps can cost an arm and a leg and aren't really useful outside of bicycle-bound illumination.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to redress all of this, I've created an adapter that allows you to attach a small flashlight to the handlebars of your very own bicycle.  Get a good standalone flashlight, and attach it to your bike only when you need a light!  I use a 4sevens Quark Mini 123, but practically any small flashlight should fit.\r\n\r\nThis thing prints just fine without support, even if the geometry looks a little weird."
