function = "I add arcol.hu hotend support for Greg's Hinged Accessible Extruder.\r\nThis is my first ever try with openscad. \r\nSo the code maybe not the most optimal.\r\nHere it is the version 2 of extruder block with arcol hot-end support. I have widened the base in the middle, to not allow any movement for the arcol hot-end.\r\nVersion 2 is untested! As I did not have the time to print it yet."
