function: Updated my previous design, but Buback released his design first so I waited on my version. I was held up looking for the Makerbot font to improve the look and get bonus points putting Makerbot on my release. Big thumbs to Buback for making a self tapping mount. It's exactly what I was asked to change on my redesign.
