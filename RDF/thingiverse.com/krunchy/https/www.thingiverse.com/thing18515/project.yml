function: "This is my copy of Zarquon's Galaxy Nexus car mount ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15490 ).  The suction cup part is $7.50 ( http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Generation-Vehicle-Charger-Packaging/dp/B002Y3BYQA ) which seems like a bargain for someone looking for things to model and print.  \n\nI duplicated the design in Google Sketchup from scratch because I can't do much with STL files.  I cut out some fill and integrated the adapter plate ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15432 ).  I also changed the screw holes to accept hex nuts.  I removed the center nub in the front, it didn't do much to secure my phone.  Most importantly, I added spaces for the buttons so they are usable and not contacted by the mount.  \n\nThe back is Zarquon's STL with a rectangular chunk sliced out to accomodate the power button.  \n\nUPDATE: I've finally gotten around to upgrading my printer to ABS, so today I printed another copy.  I've since switched to Slic3r which had some trouble on the back, so I've re-modeled that in Sketchup as well.  The tracks for the screws aren't quite at the right spot, but it works well because it grips without needing to tighten the screws."
