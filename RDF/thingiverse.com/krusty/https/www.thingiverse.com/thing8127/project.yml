function: "I had a bunch of old Silicon Chip magazines sitting in a cardboard box and since I'm on a quest to rid my house of cardboard boxes (evil, horrible things) I decided I needed a magazine storage solution. \r\n\r\nSure, I could drive down to Officeworks (A megastore of stationary here in Australia) and simply pick one up off the shelf for a few dollars (Well, $15 for one this size). It would have been a no-brainer. But that just didn't seem sporting! \r\n\r\nSo last night I sat down in front of my computer and fired up CorelDRAW and designed this and today, armed with a sheet of 6mm MDF, I set my laser cutter to work. It's got enough room to fit a bunch of magazines and should I need more I can just cut them out! I figure it cost me about $6 for the MDF - less than half the cost of buying one :)"
