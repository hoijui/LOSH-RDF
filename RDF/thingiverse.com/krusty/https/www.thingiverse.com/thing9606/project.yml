function: "A couple of months ago I purchased a Sandisk Cruzer Slice USB drive. It originally had a slide-in-slide-out function, however fairly quickly the locking mechanism failed and you had to hold the little release handle tight to stop it closing when plugging it into a USB slot - something that got old very quickly. \r\n\r\nSo I thought it was time to give it a new case :) Laser cut from 3mm acrylic - clear top and bottom with a red core & flame."
