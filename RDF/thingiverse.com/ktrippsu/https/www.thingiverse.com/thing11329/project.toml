function = "I took the gear for the y-axis of the prusa and made a few modifications to increase its reliability and usability. First off, I extended the gear surface area in order to give a little more leeway with the placement of the pulley in regard to the x-direction. Also, the flared end opposite the set screw will keep the belt on the gear in case it decides to creep to the end and try to fall off."
