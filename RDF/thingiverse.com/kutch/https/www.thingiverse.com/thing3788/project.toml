function = "I received, and built, the MakerGear ceramic heated build platform and am very happy with it, except for the aluminum plate that sits on top.  I have it taped down but it was still sliding a little, not much.  Didn\\\\\\'t want to attach it with something that could be hard to take off later in case need to change something, so this design was born.\r\n\r\nThe design uses the existing M3 bolts for the build platform, couple extra nuts and washers, and hold everything in place nicely.  Have been using the design for building my last 10-15 things and so far has held up well.\r\n\r\nA modification I did to the HBP from them was to wire up all the contacts (except for the LED light) directly to the ceramic piece underneath.  I was having connection issues so epoxied the wires underneath the connections.  These brackets should work for the standard install instructions.\r\n\r\nUsed Catarina Mota's shapes.scad file, which have uploaded.  I could not find the original post for it to give her proper credit, but thanks soo much Catarina!"
