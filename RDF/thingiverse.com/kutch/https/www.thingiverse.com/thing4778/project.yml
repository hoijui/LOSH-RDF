function: "Tried printing off the original ones, but since am currently not using an SD card with my electronics, it really didn't work all that well.  Too much excess kapooie when doing the rounded corners.  Am thinking it is because of the communication lag.\r\n\r\nSoooo, that brings me to this thing.  Hopefully it's a close enough replica of the original, with the exception of being parametric (can change a bunch of things) and have friendly square corners.  Had to make the bottom piece very thin as skeinpoop, err, skeinforge, was not doing the nicest of things.  So made an addendum piece just to print off to glue that will provide extra stiffness.\r\n\r\nThe uploaded stl's are 70mm in length, and have it set to print two of them, but feel free to change to print whatever you desire.  \r\n\r\nAgain, thanks to Catarina Mota, and her shapes.scad file.  I had to change it slightly (ssshhh, don't tell her) as the triangle was not behaving properly due to the angles.  Am sure could have just flipped some numbers around but I didn't..  Increased the multiplier from 2 to 4 in the RightTriangle piece of code."
