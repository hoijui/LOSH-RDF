function: "I have been using Taylors Ultimaker feeder for a while and i have broken the mount piece twice while travelling with my ultimaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will probably modify this and move the feeder another cm to the right, to line the filament intake hole over the outer area of the spool. \r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate 17-09-12: v2_r4\r\nSo on the second day of te maker faire i realised that the mount was sagging. Likely due to how close the stepper is to the mount.\r\nAnother 2 internal revisions, i have moved the feeder about a 1 cm closer to the right side. \r\n\r\nThis helps in two ways, the mount is now not warming up as much, it also adds some more space between the large gear and the spools on the spool mount."
