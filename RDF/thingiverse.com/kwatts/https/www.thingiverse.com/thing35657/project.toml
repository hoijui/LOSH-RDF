function = "This is a printable extruder plate for the ultimaker.\r\n\r\nI really like Jelle's 4 extruder plate, but the local hackspaces do not have a laser capable of cutting the 6mm plywood.\r\n\r\nThis solves my problem of where to put the second extruder. \r\n\r\nI made it a tiny bit wider that the laser cut ones so they will fit a printed extruder."
