function = "A table stand for a standard 92.5mm computer fan, meant to use some of the leftover threaded rod, smooth rod and other hardware from making a Prusa Mendel. I created it so that my \"helping hands\" can be relieved for duty and do other things than cool my prints.\r\n\r\nThis is a thing in progress. Please go ahead and print it out and let me know how it's coming along. This is my first \"thing\" and also the fist thing I've ever designed in 3D or with OpenSCAD."
