function: The Mouse Guard RPG box set is now out of print and unavailable, and so the tokens included in the box are gone. I wanted my best friend's 8 year old son to have a little bit of the box set experience when I gave him the vanishingly rare copy of the rule book I was able to get this winter. The design is similar, but significantly different than the original design. This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/lWnpcw5Ixdw
