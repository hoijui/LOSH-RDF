function = "Want to transport your RepRap without having to re-align, re-tighten and generally re-calibrate your bot? This set of things will allow you to secure your RepRap Prusa Mendel i1 or i2 to a piece of wood, typically plywood, so it can be moved without tweaking your frame. It also has the benefit of stabilizing the machine, improving prints."
