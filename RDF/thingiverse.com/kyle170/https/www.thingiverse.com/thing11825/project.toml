function = "The model was created in Autodesk Inventor 2011, using only 90 degree angles to maintain its rigid appearance. It was designed to stand up on a desk or computer, and was inspired by the increasing popular game called Minecraft. Additionally, the design was meant to test the makerbot. The Creeper is a close to exact scale model of the one in the game. It was supposed to have 4 legs instead of 2 but I decided to have 2 because it would be more structurally strong.\r\n\r\n     Due to the laws of physics, the original print didn't turn out exactly as i wanted it to. As you can see by the attached images, the mouth sagged a bit because the Makerbot was forced to extrude the plastic in mid air (as it prints layer by layer). I then refined the original design to prevent this from happening by increasing the width of the bottom of the mouth."
