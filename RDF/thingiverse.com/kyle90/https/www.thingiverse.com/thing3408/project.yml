function: "Inspired by Skimbal\\'s VW Bus (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1454), I thought I\\'d try making a car. It\\'s mostly solid instead of hollow so it takes a while to print but the finished product looks pretty good! I might try painting on some details like windows and racing stripes. The model has been split into four parts so it will fit in a MakerBot and to avoid excessive overhang.\r\n\r\nMy dad has a \\'69 Roadrunner and I\\'m visiting my parents in a couple of weeks so I plan to get some measurements and see if I can make the model more accurate. For now I\\'m pleased with the initial results."
