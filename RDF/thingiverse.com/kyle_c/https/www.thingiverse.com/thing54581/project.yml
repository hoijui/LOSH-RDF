function: "It's an icosahedron! I made this for a friend of mine, and I thought I might as well share. I don't think there's an icosahedron that's hollow already up here.\r\n\r\nI'll upload my source file too. This was a fun object to model, because it can be constructed with three perpendicular golden rectangles."
