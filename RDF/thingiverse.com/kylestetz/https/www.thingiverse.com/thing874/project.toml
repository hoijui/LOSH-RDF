function = "I wanted to test the tolerance on my machine so I was looking for something small to design around... The makerbot body seemed like a good idea.\r\n\r\nThese are general purpose clips (meant to be designed onto) that will latch anywhere the plywood of the makerbot body sticks out 3/8ths of an inch. Mine fit snug and seem like they could support a good amount of weight.\r\n\r\nIn trying to come up with something useful I decided to make a holster for the allen wrench that most of the makerbot bolts use. You know, since I misplace it about 110% percent of the time."
