function = "Battery cover for Logitech EX110 wireless keyboard.\r\nMy kids are really hard on keyboards, they recently managed to loose the battery cover for this one, so I designed a new one in scad. The print is ok but orange was possibly not the best colour selection!\r\nThe SCAD file is parametrised so might be usable for other battery cover requirements."
