function = "Print a box to hold a given number of items of a specified size.\r\n\r\nGit repository: http://github.com/l0b0/parametric-box\r\n\r\nVersion 2 contains the QR code embedded in the back plate. This is a demo of http://github.com/l0b0/qr2scad, which was slapped together today to enable this sort of thing dynamically.\r\n\r\nIf someone sees the QR code on your thing in real life, they can find the design and make their own copies with just a photo of it. Theoretically, you could even assign this job to a machine, looking around the web (or your tool box) for things that can be duplicated.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to encode the .scad file in a QR code (after using http://github.com/l0b0/OpenSCAD-Minimizer) and include that on the model. Nicely Von Neumann-friendly :)"
