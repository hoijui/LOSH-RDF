function: "This is a VERY simple thing, but I'm gonna try to document real good :)\r\n\r\nIf you want to actually machine sew the conductive thread from SparkFun ( https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8549 ), you will want to spool them on that small thing.  The big spool from SFE did match the sewing machine's peg, so I made a simple adapter.\r\n\r\nThe print quality was really bad, but it did the job."
