function = "Ever wanted to buy a spool of filament with a friend ? Ever wanted to split a full spool into two small ones ?\r\n\r\nThis thing will allow you to transfer as much as you want from one spool to another.\r\n\r\nThe needed bolt is calculated as to where a Wade's Hobbed Bolt is the perfect drop in replacement. If you have another length, this can easily be adjusted in the OpenScad-File.\r\n\r\nAs you can see on the pictures, it fits the two widely used spindel formats.\r\n\r\nOn one of the pictures, you can see that the hobbed bolt was clogged with some red filament grains when I started this build.\r\n\r\nThe circular teardrops are copied from some wade's."
