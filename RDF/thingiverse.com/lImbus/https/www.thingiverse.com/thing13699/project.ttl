\r
This thing will allow you to transfer as much as you want from one spool to another.\r
\r
The needed bolt is calculated as to where a Wade's Hobbed Bolt is the perfect drop in replacement. If you have another length, this can easily be adjusted in the OpenScad-File.\r
\r
As you can see on the pictures, it fits the two widely used spindel formats.\r
\r
On one of the pictures, you can see that the hobbed bolt was clogged with some red filament grains when I started this build.\r
\r
The circular teardrops are copied from some wade's.""" ;
