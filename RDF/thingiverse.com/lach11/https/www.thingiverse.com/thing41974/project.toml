function = "I bought a 4.3\" TFT LCD Color Monitor off eBay for a reverse camera I installed in my car and had nothing to mount it to my car with. Monitor dimensions were 120mm(L) x 75mm(W) x 15mm(H) and this seemed to fit quite snugly. I have only created a couple of 'pads' on the rear of the case for glueing to the car surface as a generic solution, although permanent adhesion may not be ideal for some. The pads also give some clearance for the AV/power leads to feed through the back. Have added the .skp for modification if required."
