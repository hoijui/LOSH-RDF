function: A friend had an iPhone 4S car cradle (iPhone 4 mount + arm) and after buying an iPhone 5, asked if I could make a new mount for his iPhone 5 which would retrofit onto the arm of his existing cradle. I think that made sense. Anyway, this is the outcome. The iPhone 5 mount is based on jbobrow's case (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31026) and has been modified at the base to fit onto a car mounting arm. I personally don't have an iPhone 5 but presumably the case fits fine. Not sure how generic the mounting base is across phone cradles of this type but hopefully this is of use to someone else. Just as a side note, I found that the raft removal was pretty fiddly with this one. Following the first print attempt and a little too much garage profanity, I thickened the bottom of the case and mounting cradle to minimise the chance of any damage whilst removing the raft. Might need some tweeking so have uploaded the .skp.
