function = "Amazed at the nifty math of the Parametric Measuring Cup that allows me to make cups of any size I like, I added text labels so that I can see the size of each cup.\r\n\r\nThe label is inset into the bottom of the bottom of the measuring cup (the part on the table), and is raised on the top of the bottom of the measuring cup (the part you see when filling it up). So, yes, this cup now under-measures by the volume of the raised text."
