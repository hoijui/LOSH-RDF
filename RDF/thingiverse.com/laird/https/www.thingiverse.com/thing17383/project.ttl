\r
You should be able to size it to slip over a Bic pen, or to use as a barrel of a pen kit.\r
\r
While this wasn't exactly derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17339, it was certainly inspired by it. I built it in OpenSCAD, to make sizing and text generation easier.\r
\r
Updated so that the pen's face is at z=0, making it easier to print.""" ;
