function: "No more losing your pens! This is parametric pen, which you can put a label on. Because who wouldn't want a pen with their name printed as the shape of the pen.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to size it to slip over a Bic pen, or to use as a barrel of a pen kit.\r\n\r\nWhile this wasn't exactly derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17339, it was certainly inspired by it. I built it in OpenSCAD, to make sizing and text generation easier.\r\n\r\nUpdated so that the pen's face is at z=0, making it easier to print."
