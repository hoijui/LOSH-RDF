function = "The original canopy is very hard to print, with thin vertical walls that bend while printing, and huge bridging across the top.\r\n\r\nMy beautiful wife Juliette pointed out that it would be  much easier to print upside down, so I flipped it over and added thin walls across the openings to hold it steady as it's printing. So I modified the original SketchUp file slightly, and the result works."
