And I cut out my initials because it kinda looks cool. This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/bcDNf8u1Tqu . In particular, if you make a copy and tinker it, you can ungroup it and make your own personalized cutout.\r
\r
I'm not sure which iPhone case this is derived from. If you recognize let me know and I'll credit it appropriately.""" ;
