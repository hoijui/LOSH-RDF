function: "I am taking my son to the NYC Maker Faire for his birthday present, and made him this badge as a physical token. It worked - he has been giggling for days. OK, the print is a little messy, but he's 7, loves tech and 3d printing, and the badge glows in the dark!\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/9aduw7zYExJ"
