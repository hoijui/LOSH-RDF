function = "Feel in love with this game, and ravix' awesome tiles. But I'm too lazy to print and swap filament for 72 tiles. So I whipped up an OpenSCAD script to arrange the tiles into four plates for printing on a Replicator, and generated plates. I also generated plate pairs for dualstrusion.\r\n\r\nAll of the files are in one zip file (which is much smaller than the files uncompressed). That is:\r\n\r\ncarcassonne - cathedral_3-1 (repaired).stl, because OpenSCAD wouldn't load the original for some reason, and netfabb fixed it.\r\n\r\nplate1-bottom.stl\r\nplate1-top.stl\r\nplate1.stl\r\n\r\nplate2-bottom.stl\r\nplate2-top.stl\r\nplate2.stl\r\n\r\nplate3-bottom.stl\r\nplate3-top.stl\r\nplate3.stl\r\n\r\nplate4-bottom.stl\r\nplate4-top.stl\r\nplate4.stl\r\n\r\nplates.scad - script to generate the plates from tile STL files"
