function: "My wife broke her little toe, and I made her this to protect it while it's taped up. Looks best printed in blue, so it's like having a tiny Tardis on your toe. (Well, it made her smile, which is about all you can do for a broke toe.)\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/3BMQuWcqeb7"
