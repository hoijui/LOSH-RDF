And now it's Customizable, making it even easier for you to make exactly the measuring cup of your heart's desire. Or at least, exactly the amount of coffee for your perfect cup of coffee. Or the volume of your brain, etc.  

Note: the measuring cup is flipped upside down so that you can see the text in Customizer. Flip it over so that the bottom of the cup is on the print bed to print.  

** Now with super built-plate preview goodness!""" ;
