function = "When you put a material onto the Replicator's print bed to print onto, such as glass or wood, you need to adjust for that thickness. The springs are only adjustable by a small amount, and when you move then you have to re-level. By putting a clip of a given thickness on the back of the print bed, where it touches the Z limit switch, you cause the bed to stop that much lower, leaving room for the glass, wood, etc.\r\n\r\nOne nice property is that you can add and remove glass, and swap the adjuster, and not have to re-level the print bed.\r\nThe original idea is from the parent Thing, but this is an original implementation."
