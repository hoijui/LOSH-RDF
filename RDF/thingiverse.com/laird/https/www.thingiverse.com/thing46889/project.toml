function = "kitlaan's Circular Gallifreyan Coin with a few minor tweaks that I think look cool.  \n- Lines cross the entire coin  \n- Lines go in randomized directions.   \n- Added 'seed' parameter. Change its value to change where the lines go.  \n- Increased $fn to make the curves smoother (and Customizable).  \nSame in all other ways. kitlaan rocks."
