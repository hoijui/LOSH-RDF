function = "Inspired by the (now out of production) Spacewarp roller coaster system, I decided to see if I could make something similar that's all printed. Here's the result!  \r\n\r\nFor examples of SpaceWarp in action, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJK1NxoreDI and follow the links. Or browse around http://www.angelfire.com/journal/scottmills/SpaceWarp/spacewarp.html  . In particular, the Gallery ( http://www.angelfire.com/journal/scottmills/SpaceWarp/Gallery/Gallery.html ) has some good example sets. And if you read the manuals he's scanned and posted, you can see exactly how large, complex sets are put together.  \r\n\r\nUPDATED: Added parts:  \r\n- Loop: flip a ball around 180 degrees  \r\n- Tee Bar: makes it easy to run track looping around a vertical bar"
