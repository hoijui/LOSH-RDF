function = "This is a bracket I made for mounting an adjustable desk top positioner to my drafting table. Besides being pretty, it keeps the positioner rod from hitting the lip of my table.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I misplaced the nice brass screws before I got my brackets painted like brass. For now, I had to hold it in place while taking the photo."
