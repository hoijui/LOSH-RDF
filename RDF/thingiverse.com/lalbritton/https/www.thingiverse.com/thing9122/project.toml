function = "Was \"Analog Sine/Cosine Calculating Machine\", but then I found the actual name for this device, which I really like.\r\n\r\nIt is a thing to hold, enjoy turning the crank, and look at. If you can't find your calculator, and need to know the sine or cosine of an angle real quick, you can dial in the angle and read off of the Scotch Yokes. It also works in reverse.\r\n\r\nI plan to paint one up, hang it on my wall, and use it to help explain Trig to my kids. I have built and assembled one.\r\n\r\nThis was initially going to be a simple design to help me learn Alibre. Simple was lost at some point, I'm afraid. I am thinking about adding a paper feed and pencil holder, so I can plot with it.\r\n\r\nI've included a photo of two prototype versions, where I worked out the mechanical details. You can read more about them here, along with notes on why I'm making my own printed screws: http://swampcastle.blogspot.com/2011/06/sincos-prototypes.html\r\n\r\nI also added photos of some now-funny-looking prototypes that helped me get the design to where it is today.\r\n\r\nThere are various other articles about this project on my blog: http://swampcastle.blogspot.com/"
