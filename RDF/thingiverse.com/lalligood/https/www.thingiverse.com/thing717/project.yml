function: "I didn\\'t have a program to easily print the original .EPS file so that I could print/cut it on the laser.  I took the time to recreate it in Inkscape as a .SVG file.  I put a 1\\\"x1\\\" reference square at the bottom to ensure anyone using the file will have the right dimensions.\r\n\r\nMine were made with blue acrylic because that\\'s what I happened to have on hand at the time."
