function: "Designed for an upcoming robotics competition at WPI in which the robots must \\\"improve quality of life\\\" in some way:\r\n\r\nBloombot is an open-source automated hydroponics system that aims to build community and increase the engagement of people with their food. Bloombot is capable of growing plants like lettuces and herbs throughout the year and, through use of Twitter integration hopes to build off the work of other products (like AeroGrow and Botanicalls) to integrate some of their functionality to produce a machine that is greater than the sum of its parts.\r\n\r\nStill working on finishing up the parts list but it's almost complete."
