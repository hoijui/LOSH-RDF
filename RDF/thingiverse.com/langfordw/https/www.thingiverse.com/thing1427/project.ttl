    okh:function """I was recently contacted by a blind man, Dave, who was interested in getting some samples of the braille I printed on the makerbot earlier this year. I took the opportunity to refine the design a bit more before shipping a few test pieces off to him early this week. \r
\r
Just yesterday he received them and was immediately able to read them. To quote: "I am enormously impressed. With my fingernail I can feel where the filaments laid down.  With my fingertips though, the dots are correct sized, smooth feeling and comfortable to read.  I really think this is professional quality stuff."\r
\r
The next step is to figure out if there's a need for this kind of braille production. I'm currently doing some research on traditional methods of creating braille and am talking with Dave about the feasibility of actually using the makerbot to produce braille.""" ;
