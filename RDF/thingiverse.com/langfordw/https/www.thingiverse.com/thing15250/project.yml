function: "Mimbo is a friendly robot who mimics your emotions/expressions. He has a cardboard box for a body and an iPhone for a face. See him in action here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=csYPpxBOBCA\r\n\r\nThe body is made from a single sheet of cardboard and is folded and hot-glued to form the 3D shape. It was designed in 3D in Solidworks and flattened using the sheet metal tools. \r\n\r\nThe iPhone display is controlled via a Processing script that controls a TouchOSC interface running on the phone. Face tracking is used to sense the user's emotional expression and mimic it.\r\n\r\nFull instructions on how to go about the coding part are posted here: http://www.instructables.com/id/Mimbo-A-Friendly-Robot/"
