function = "This is the next iteration of my original sumobot design.\r\n\r\nA few changes:\r\n* It\\'s made from three pieces, not one\r\n*It uses two solarbotics GM8 gear motors (actually the pololu 120:1 equivalent), instead of continuous servos\r\n* It works.\r\n\r\nI\\'m really happy with how it came out.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n I\\'ve updated the files since I first posted this thing. They\\'re pretty small tweaks but they really help when trying to wire up the whole thing and hold down the electronics. \r\n\r\nI've posted a video of it in action. It still has no opponent sensing/detection but it's staying within the white space perfectly.
