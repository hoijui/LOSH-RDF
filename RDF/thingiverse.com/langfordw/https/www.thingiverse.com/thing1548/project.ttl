\r
A few changes:\r
* It\\'s made from three pieces, not one\r
*It uses two solarbotics GM8 gear motors (actually the pololu 120:1 equivalent), instead of continuous servos\r
* It works.\r
\r
I\\'m really happy with how it came out.\r
\r
**UPDATE**\r
 I\\'ve updated the files since I first posted this thing. They\\'re pretty small tweaks but they really help when trying to wire up the whole thing and hold down the electronics. \r
\r
I've posted a video of it in action. It still has no opponent sensing/detection but it's staying within the white space perfectly. See it here:\r

Stay tuned for thorough instructions/code and possibly a chassis kit for sale at botmade.etsy.com""" ;
