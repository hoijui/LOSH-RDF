\r
I had thought of trying this idea a few months ago but never acted on it. Then, yesterday I was playing with clay and decided it would be cool to squeeze the clay in a fist and use it to create a handle that perfectly matches my hand.\r
\r
It works amazingly well (and noticeably better for my right hand than for my left).""" ;
