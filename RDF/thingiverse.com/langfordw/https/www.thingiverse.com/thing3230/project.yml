function: "This ergonomic handle eliminates the problem of heavy plastic bags digging into your fingers and, instead, aims to evenly distribute the heavy load through your fingers and palm with its form fitting design.\r\n\r\nI had thought of trying this idea a few months ago but never acted on it. Then, yesterday I was playing with clay and decided it would be cool to squeeze the clay in a fist and use it to create a handle that perfectly matches my hand.\r\n\r\nIt works amazingly well (and noticeably better for my right hand than for my left)."
