function = "I decided to have a go at designing something 3D. This is a case for a simple 9v flashlight that uses a 9v battery, two 5mm LED's, a resistor, and a switch. It uses a snap joint to join the two parts.\r\n\r\nI\\'m not good with blender at all so I did it with Autodesk Inventor. You\\'ll probably have to play with the orientation and stuff so that it will be printable.\r\n\r\n--EDIT--\r\nI removed the snap joint because I found it wasn't very printable (at least the way I had it) so the top just fits quite snugly on the bottom."
