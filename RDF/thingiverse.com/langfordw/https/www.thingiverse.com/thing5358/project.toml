function = "Markerbot is a low-cost robot designed to get young kids programming. The robot features an IR reader which allows kids to program the robot to do whatever they want by simply coloring in the appropriate arrows on a paper strip. \r\n\r\nFour IR sensors are positioned along the circumference of the reader and pick up their respective column of tick marks on the strip of paper. The fourth column on the strip is pre-printed with a set of tick marks to indicate when the other sensors should check to see if tick marks are in their own column. The code running on the Arduino splits the strip into 3x3 chunks and extracts the various movement commands to be executed once the \"Go!\" button is pushed.\r\n\r\nThis was made for a robotics class. Check out a video of it in action as well as some of the other students' designs...\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/me842010/home/markerbot"
