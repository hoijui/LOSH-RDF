function = "This is still very much a work in progress but I thought I'd just get it out there.\n\nContinuing on Bre's idea of printing a watch... I made a DalÃxad inspired melting watch. Of course it's not functional (at least not yet). I'm working on a way to attach it to your wrist. Maybe I can have it be more like a bracelet and have the \"melted-ness\" wrap almost all the way around the wrist.\n\nI also need to add hands. I guess I'll have to make those separately because I can't figure out a way to make it printable if I integrate them into this piece.\n\nThe letters are about 1mm wide at their thinnest point so it shouldn't turn out too bad. Still, I'm a little worried about the general print-ability but I oriented it the way I think might have the most success."
