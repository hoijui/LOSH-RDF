\r
Continuing on Bre\\'s idea of printing a watch... I made a DalÃ­ inspired melting watch. Of course it\\'s not functional (at least not yet). I\\'m working on a way to attach it to your wrist. Maybe I can have it be more like a bracelet and have the \\"melted-ness\\" wrap almost all the way around the wrist.\r
\r
I also need to add hands. I guess I\\'ll have to make those separately because I can\\'t figure out a way to make it printable if I integrate them into this piece.\r
\r
The letters are about 1mm wide at their thinnest point so it shouldn\\'t turn out too bad. Still, I\\'m a little worried about the general print-ability but I oriented it the way I think might have the most success.""" ;
