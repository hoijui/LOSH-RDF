function = "This is an updated version of my previous medium format camera. I wanted to make a simple one that I was sure was going to print. The smaller size also means it'll be in better focus when used with a Holga lens and shutter assembly.\r\n\r\nYou can either just attach your own pinhole to the front or you can print out the holga attachment and mount a Holga lens and shutter assembly right on the front giving you a fully functional camera with a proper shutter.\r\n\r\nThe size of the images is going to be a little funky (3.6cm wide and 6cm tall) but it works."
