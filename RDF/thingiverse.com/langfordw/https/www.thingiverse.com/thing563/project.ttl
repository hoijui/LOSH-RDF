\r
You can either just attach your own pinhole to the front or you can print out the holga attachment and mount a Holga lens and shutter assembly right on the front giving you a fully functional camera with a proper shutter.\r
\r
The size of the images is going to be a little funky (3.6cm wide and 6cm tall) but it works.""" ;
