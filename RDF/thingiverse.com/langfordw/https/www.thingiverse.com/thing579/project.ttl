I thought that being able to print your own parts bin would be awesome because you could customize to fit the exact requirements. You can also emboss or engrave the part name or logo or whatever right on the front for easy finding.\r
\r
The ridge at the top lines up with a cut in the bottom so that they will stack nicely and should be perfectly printable. I also implemented nice curved bottoms to make getting those small resistors a little easier.\r
\r
I wish I could make it a little bit easier to customize for other people. I'm not sure if there's a format I can save it in that will allow you to edit features directly (instead of going through .stl).""" ;
