After just a few design iterations though, I could see that it was going to work.  \nFor me what was so awesome was that the Makerbot allowed a very natural and intuitive design process/flow. I quickly mocked up a rough design and printed it out. This allowed me to see where problems were going to come up. I thickened it in areas and adjusted some dimensions and printed another. I went through another two iterations to finally come to the perfect design. This all happened within five hours of my brother even suggesting the idea while still having time to watch a full movie and eat dinner.  \nDefinitely one of the most satisfying designs/things I've made especially considering this is something that is very hard to buy these days.   \nThank you Makerbot!"
