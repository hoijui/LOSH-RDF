function: "The makerbot finally printed me some glasses!\r\n\r\nI decided to start out with some nice thick frames inspired primarily by Cory Doctorow and Bre Pettis, though I have plans for a lot more styles and shapes.\r\n\r\nAs for practicality...\r\nI honestly wasn't expecting these to be comfortable but they actually are. They're really light and after a while I forget I'm even wearing them. I can even wear them over my normal glasses.\r\nPLUS major geek bonus points for wearing GLASSES YOU PRINTED YOURSELF."
