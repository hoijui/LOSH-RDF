Yep.... exactly the size to pop and LED in. Where does the power come from you ask? How about a coin cell battery embedded within one of the modular pieces (a captive print!). Memory wire connects everything together giving it a perfect springy feel.\r\n\r\nThis thing was a lot harder to get together than I thought it would be and turned out to be a whole weekend project. The trickiest part to figure out was what material to connect them with. I tried everything from string, stranded wire, magnets and even conductive thread. The memory wire works great. Although I\\'m still not perfectly happy with the on/off functionality or the joining of the two ends, I hear you can buy endcaps that seem like they would solve the problem.\r\n\r\nNow that I've iterated through a bunch of materials and ideas though they're pretty easy to build and work well.\r\n\r\nI want to start seeing some people rock out with Makerbot made accessories!"
