\r
This thing has a lot going on. It may look like an ordinary bracelet but you see all those holes? Yep.... exactly the size to pop and LED in. Where does the power come from you ask? How about a coin cell battery embedded within one of the modular pieces (a captive print!). Memory wire connects everything together giving it a perfect springy feel.\r
\r
This thing was a lot harder to get together than I thought it would be and turned out to be a whole weekend project. The trickiest part to figure out was what material to connect them with. I tried everything from string, stranded wire, magnets and even conductive thread. The memory wire works great. Although I\\'m still not perfectly happy with the on/off functionality or the joining of the two ends, I hear you can buy endcaps that seem like they would solve the problem.\r
\r
Now that I've iterated through a bunch of materials and ideas though they're pretty easy to build and work well.\r
\r
I want to start seeing some people rock out with Makerbot made accessories!""" ;
