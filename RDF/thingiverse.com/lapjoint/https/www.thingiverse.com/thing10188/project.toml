This one works fine, but please have a look at my other things too if you're interested in printing a boomerang.*\r\n\r\nA simple tri-blade boomerang.   \r\n\r\n\r\nLook anywhere on the web for throwing instructions, e.g.: http://www.rediboom.com - this is an actual returning boomerang!\r\n\r\nEdit: Videos of this design in flight have been posted on Youtube. Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nI'll add more once I find them.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/38K8bOXgk2M\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Vd0Mm0uMtkA"
