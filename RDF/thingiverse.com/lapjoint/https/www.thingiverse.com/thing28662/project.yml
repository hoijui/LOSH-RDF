function: "A boomerang that I modeled after one that I made from wood.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is similar to thing:28603, it only has sharper airfoils and I took care that it is about 20 x 20 units in the STL file, which scales easily to the 20cm x 20cm space that the 3D printing company I use offers.  \r\n\r\n**Note for Lefties:** You'll need a mirror image of the boomerang. A mirrored copy is included in the downloadable files."
