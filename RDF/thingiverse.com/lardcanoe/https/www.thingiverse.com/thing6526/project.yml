function: I was hanging a very heavy mirror and had to drill some large holes for the anchors. The screw needed some support so I printed up these pieces. They rest on the drywall. Obviously this is an extremely simple object and I don't expect anyone to download it, but I find it more of an inspirational object, so I am sharing it...
