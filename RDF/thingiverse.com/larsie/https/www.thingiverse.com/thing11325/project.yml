function: "I'm not proud of the design of this. It's rather ugly. But I thought I'd still upload it to see if it could inspire someone else to make a nicer version. I hope maybe someone find the simplicity of it quite cute. \r\n\r\nIt's a common design of a 4 servo biped walker. It can be controlled with an RF remote, an Arduino, an MSP430 Launchpad or similar. It walks, dances... well moves around. \r\n\r\nI've posted a video here:\r\n\r\nhttp://lars.roland.bz/2011/09/08/3d-printed-simple-biped-with-4-servos/\r\n\r\nI haven't included an upper body yet. I'm just using a Lego plate on the video, but I'm planning to build a proper body for it. I thought I might add some arms and some mini-servos to control those also..."
