It's basically a well known device from shoes, jackets etc, that are apparently called toggles (thanks). It could be redesigned in all sorts of ways, maybe even showing a head or some other object. This was made quite quickly, since he didn't want to wear his shoes on the way to kinder garten. :-) \r
\r
I have made another version and have added the STL files for this also. It's called toggles.stl. This one is smaller and has a slightly different shape.""" ;
