function = "I saw there was one printrbot clone http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14130 , so I thought I'd post the files I have been working on. Same reverse engineering process. They are not a derivative, except having looked at the pictures. Though if the originals had been here, I would have posted them as a derivative... eh... or I wouldn't have just printed the originals I guess. \r\n\r\nIt's just the base (and some funny feet to put under it). \r\n\r\nI like the concept, and I'm looking forward to seeing the 'real files' when they get published. \r\n\r\nUpdate: I've added a different variant which is more plastic (not using the threaded rods to keep it together). I haven't printed it though. I've also swapped the place of the threaded and smooth z-rods."
