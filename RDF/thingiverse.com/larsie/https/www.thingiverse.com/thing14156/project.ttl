They are not a derivative, except having looked at the pictures. Though if the originals had been here, I would have posted them as a derivative... eh... or I wouldn't have just printed the originals I guess. \r
\r
It's just the base (and some funny feet to put under it). \r
\r
I like the concept, and I'm looking forward to seeing the 'real files' when they get published. \r
\r
Update: I've added a different variant which is more plastic (not using the threaded rods to keep it together). I haven't printed it though. I've also swapped the place of the threaded and smooth z-rods.""" ;
