function: "I've been thinking that I want a more portable reprap printer. One that I can collapse together so that it fits into a smaller space while moving it. I think maybe it'd be possible to do an adaptation of the printrbot design and edit it (as shown in the picture) so that the platform can be lifted up. \r\n\r\nIt's not done yet, but the files show the idea. It's sort of a derivative of printrbot I guess, but all the files are mine. \r\n\r\nSeveral of the components could be taken from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14208 which is a bit more advanced in some areas, and parametric. \r\n\r\nComments are welcome. I'll try to finish it and print it to see how it works in real life. \r\n\r\nThe moi3d files that contain the design are attached."
