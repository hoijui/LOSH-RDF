function: "This is a combination of a 3d-printed and laser cut box. I really like how the sides of my 3d-prints come out, but the top is never so nice. So I thought I'd laser-cut the top and bottom, but 3d-print the sides. I've made the top sides of the box very thin, so that the laser cut acrylic fits right inside. Then I glue the top on from the inside. The bottom is screwed on using normal M3 screws. \r\n\r\nThe box is for the MSP430 Launchpad and fits a display board I've designed and sell on the 43oh.com store. But the concept can be used for any box of course."
