function: "My kids have been wanting me to build a spinning top since I ordered the 3d printer. They play a lot with Bey Blade and Battle striker, and I guess I should really make some compatible components. This one is very simple though. I've printed it on my Thing-o-matic. \r\n\r\nIt might have been better with a sharper tip, but my son claims it's more stable like this (best would be a rounded tip)."
