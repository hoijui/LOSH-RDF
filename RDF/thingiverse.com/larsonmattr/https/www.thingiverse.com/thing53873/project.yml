function: "A Gaiwan Tea Set that is fully functional (when printed in food safe material).  These are lidded tea cups that have all necessary components to brew a cup of tea in your hand.  \r\n\r\nEach piece was designed by tracing the surface in Inkscape and producing .dxf files.  The .dxf files were used with openscad\xC2\xB4s rotate_extrude with $fn=100 to have a nice smooth surface.   The stl files were scaled 15 fold in replicatorg, and some were flipped to make printing more successful.  I also used cloud.netfabb.com to polish some of the STL files for better slicing."
