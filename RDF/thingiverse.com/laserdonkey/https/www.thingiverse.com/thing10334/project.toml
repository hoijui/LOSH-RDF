function = "I've been playing with AutoDesk's Project Photofly, and this is the best scan I've come up with so far. I'm learning more and more about the project (it sucks that it requires Windows to useâ€¦ it needs a Mac OS X version). So far I'm impressed with the software, and results. Decent scans using only a digital camera. I'll post photos when it finishes printing :)"
