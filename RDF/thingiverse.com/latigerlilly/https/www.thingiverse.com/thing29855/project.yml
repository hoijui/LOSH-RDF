function: "Use this instead of an American quarter to release the supermarket cart from the pesky coin operated supermarket cart dispensers. That way, you don't have to leave your child unattended while you return the cart to retrieve your quarter since you didn't feed a quarter to attain the cart. Before this neat invention, your alternative would've been to sacrifice your quarter (gasp!). Brilliant!   \r\n\r\nNov 24, 2012; CartRel2.stl added to reinforce attachment to keychain to prevent breakage. Enjoy :0)  \r\n\r\nI invite you to visit [3dPrintFileMarket.com](http://www.3dprintfilemarket.com) to enjoy more cool 3d print files.
