It consists of a top ball isolator. It allows the machine to move in all directions reducing the lateral movement transfered to the table. It needs a 8mm ball bearing.\r\n\r\nThe bottom part is a spring that reduces any other vibrations that get past the ball isolator. It also has holders for a coil spring to take some of the weight of a heavier machine.\r\n\r\nI have also noticed since using these my registration has been better as the whole machine moves rather than the frame flexing. It is also much quiter then before.\r\n\r\nIt may look a bit unstable but I have been unable to topple mine yet, even giving the machine a hard shove."
