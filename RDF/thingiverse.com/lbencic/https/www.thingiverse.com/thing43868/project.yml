function: "The ring as a communication space \r\nMy idea is to use the material volume of the ring as a communication space in relationship between creators, authors, artists (users of the ex Rog factory) and public (citizens of Ljubljana, authority) related around the Rog factory.\r\nOn the one side, cuts crossing the ring-shaped form and shift-outs symbolize user's tendencies to express their ideas and rights to the public. \r\nOn the other side the public shift-in the elements of the ring-shaped form to enter Rog and consume the users\xE2\u20AC\u2122 ideas and content. \r\nThe outputs are two rings of two sizes, black and white."
