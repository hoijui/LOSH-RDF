function = "This is my first attempt at making a menorah in a laser cutter out of 1/8\\\\\\\" acrylic. It\\\\\\'s meant to be glued together not press fit and should accept \\\\\\'standard\\\\\\' Hanukkah candles. I stopped by a local supermarket that carries kosher stuff and bought the cheap kind of candles and they fit perfectly.. the thicker tapered ones need a lot of coaxing.. Making the channels wider would fix this... or maybe I\\\\\\'ll add a taper, so that the \\\\\\'holes\\\\\\' are V shaped maybe next week... DANGER WILL ROBINSON DANGER! It turns out this thing is flamable FLAMABLE FLAMABLE!!!!!! Use it with either electric candles or with some sort of candle holder put into the holes... DANGER"
