function = "Modified version of \"Yet Another Cable Chain\" by tosjduenfs.\r\n\r\nI made the bridges a lot easier to be printed (since my printer had problems printing them). I also made snapping the hinges a bit easier (flattened the raise on one side a bit). On the bottom, I shortened the ends a bit to allow for a little \"counter-bending\".\r\n\r\nIt's also a bit longer: about 17mm per piece.\r\n\r\nSeveral end pieces are coming soon. (If I don't forget it ;))"
