function = "This is a 3D scan of a sculpture converted to STL. I used freeware and a digital camera to make the mesh, decimated using Blender, and exported.  \n\nI used Netfabb to rotate the SLT to align it with a platform, slice off the bottom to make it flat, and repair mesh errors. The \"Repaired\" version is ready to slice and print.   \n\nI also included a gcode file generated using SLIC3R prepared for a RAMPS 1.4 driven printer.  \n\nThe pictures are of the object that I printed on April 30, 2013.  \n\nAlso check out http://lesagegp.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/print-of-autodesk-123d-scan/ for a description of printing this model."
