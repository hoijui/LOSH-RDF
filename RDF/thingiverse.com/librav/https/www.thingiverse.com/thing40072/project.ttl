    okh:function """OK! .......I was so very impressed by the initial design that ckaos initiated with his http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27202 , that I decided to take it to the next level. I utilized some of his parts except for the X-Carraige , which I increased in height to provide better support for the my Bowden Hot End.\r
 \r
I used Stock Drive Products (sdp-si.com) largest G2 belt which is 87.323 inches (2218 mm) long (P/N  A 6R51MB09060) as well as their 10mm Self Lubricating Acetal Bearings for the 10mm Z-Axis (P/N  A 7Z44MPSD10MAF), as well as a Z-axis LM10LUU version bearing holder.  Use whichever you prefer.\r
\r
I used  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20850 Taylors Gregs Wades MK6 filament feed for Ultimaker, by Taylor Alexander, and designed a Bowden feed mounting  bracket (short and long) to accept the filament feed system.  With my Filament feeder (3mm), I was trying to utilize Wired1's http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31322 dove tailed design in my Hot end slide.This will require additional effort since my fit did not work out as anticipated. \r
\r
I was shooting for a build volumn of 10"x10"x10" (394 mm x 394 mm x 394 mm).  The belt length was a limiting criteria.   I'll spend more time on this issue at a later time. I wanted to get a  prototype platform working at this time. I'll post the Alibre files for those of you that may be using Alibre as your 3D modeling software and choose to modify my work as well as a .dxf assembly layout drawing.  \r
Being that this is my first thingiverse publication, I kindly ask your forgivness for any mistakes I may have made.  I will work toward making future postings more professional.""" ;
