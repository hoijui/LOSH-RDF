function: 'This is the gecko guitar pick that I specially designed. It has a grip so that it wont slip out of your fingers. Warning: It is a bit hard to get off of the replicator platform. I use a knife to get it off. You could also make a raft, which is in the options when you click "Generate Gcode"'
