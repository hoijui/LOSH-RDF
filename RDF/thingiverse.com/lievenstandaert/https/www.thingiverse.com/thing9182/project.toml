function = "This is a desktop-size, open-source milling machine in kitform, built from lasercut parts.\r\nWe know several people have tried to put a Dremel inside a Makerbot, but we don't think this makes much sense. You'll have a high center of gravity and a light frame. We love our Makerbots, but we think if we put a Dremel toolhead in them, they'll just vibrate apart :)\r\n\r\nWe designed something from the ground up to be stable, rugged and still light-weight enough to be carried around. (actually, the one I'm showing in Paris this weekend now features a suitcase handle on the steel frame)\r\n\r\nThe machine has an open floor, allowing it to do a milling operation on a large object.\r\n\r\nThe machine was specifically developed to have a low center of gravity and be a portable, yet stable platform.\r\n\r\nThe machine uses a microATX 12V power supply and Makerbot electronics\r\n\r\nThe current version has a 175x175 mm cutting area.\r\n\r\nThe machine can easily be enlarged along the X-axis, as the machine is built from a number of modular parts.\r\n\r\nThere's a short video of the working machine on http://www.repairablemachines.com/updates.html\r\nYou'll also find some stuff we made with it there.\r\n\r\nThe plans are uploaded here and on www.repairablemachines.com.\r\nWe also make kits for this machine, we can provide you with all the parts you need to assemble this into a fully working milling machine\r\n\r\nUPDATE SEPTEMBER 2011: we published version 1.08 of this machine\r\nIt now has:\r\n-improved accuracy, better than 0.2mm\r\n-version numbering engraved on all parts\r\n-a more rigid Z-axis"
