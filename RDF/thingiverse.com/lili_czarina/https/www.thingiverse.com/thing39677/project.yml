function: "Pure silliness--to merge with an iconic sculpture from the Art Institute of Chicago in a screw top head.\r\n\r\nHead scanned with Kinect and ReconstructMe. Merged with Tom Burtonwood's Lion's head using Tinkercad with some finessing in MeshMixer to merge the hair with the mane. There are two overhangs that I should remove as they had problems in the print. Printed on a Rep 2."
