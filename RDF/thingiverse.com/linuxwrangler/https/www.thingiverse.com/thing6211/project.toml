function = "Just in time for Valentine's Day...hearts for printing on Egg-Bot in various forms (filled/hollow and single/surround).\r\n\r\n2011-02-09: I have relabeled this as \"In Progress\" as I have figured out some improvements. I plan to replace the current files after I test the new versions. The new versions will have less dense hatching for the fill and the outline will start/end in the top crease of the heart instead of on the side so minor registration issues should be hidden."
