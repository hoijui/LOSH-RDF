function = "Based on daichiasuka's files. Which in turn is based on Nophead's.\r\n\r\nThe frame hooks have been increased to fit my 0.5inch MDF Mendel90 frame.\r\n\r\nAfter printing a copy of the dust filter. I found it was 10mm too long. So it's been resized. Also the plastic feeding tip has been angled up more. To help the plastic avoid hitting the frame as it feeds to the extruder.\r\n\r\nSince I'm using UltiMachine PLA 1Kg spools I've created a large washer to help center the spool on the holder. See pics above for reference."
