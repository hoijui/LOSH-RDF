    okh:function """NOTE: I updated some errors in the original design, including: incorrectly low resistor values (LEDs are 1W, not 1A) and reversed wiring on the 4-pin headers. Also, I moved the control header to a place where it is less likely to cast a shadow. \r
\r
This is a design for a 12V LED board that hold 3 high power (1W) white LEDs. The board is sized to be fabricated by iTead studios for ~$13 for a lot of 10. Fully populated, the BOM is < $3/board with the power LEDs being the most expensive part ($0.30/ea for me on ebay). \r
\r
WIth the specified resistor sizes, the board will consume about 4W of power. I intend to use it to illuminate my Printrbot, and as such the 4-pin molex connector (KK) is pinned out to connect to a Floppy Power connector on a standard ATX power supply. Two power connectors are included so that multiple modules may be chained. \r
\r
There is an optional power transistor and control header that you can connect to spare 3.3/5V I/O lines to make the board controllable. \r
\r
If there's interest, I can upload CAM files for easy submission to iTead.""" ;
