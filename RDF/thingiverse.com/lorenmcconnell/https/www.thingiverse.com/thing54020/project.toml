function = "This is my first published Thing, and first OpenSCAD project!\r\n\r\nI wanted a picture frame template for some projects I am working on and decided to go a little further and make it customizable. \r\n\r\nThe picture frame is based on a design from my woodworking -- a simple circular cove.  But I wanted to do something interesting and decided to add raised text for an easy gift project.  I made the face of the text follow the curve of the cove for a appealing effect.\r\n\r\nMost design attributes are adjustable, from the artwork size, to the font, to the depth of the rabbet for the backing.  Units are in millimeters.  The backing should be a snap-in fit.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of knobs in the Customizer list, so play around.  But the defaults are nice to my eye, so to start, just set your artwork size and captions and see how it looks.  Download the code to \"get under the hood\". \r\n\r\nI am also using this picture frame design as a simple background to showcase other artistic elements.  For example, I created a script for Blender to describe the geometry of 3D Celtic knots.  (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:56629)  Adding them to the frame produced my \"Celtic 4x6 Picture Frame\". (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:55464)  \r\n\r\nThanks to the developers of OpenSCAD and the \"write.scad\" library for making this project possible.  \r\n\r\nI do not yet have a printer, so if you do print one, let me know how it turns out! \r\n\r\nThanks!"
