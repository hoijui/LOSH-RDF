function: "This is a Python script that I've been working on for Blender, to generate 3D geometry based on bezier curves.  My goal is to produce a variety of attractive and accurate Celtic knots and braids to use as artistic elements in my projects.  \r\n\r\nI developed a customizable picture frame as a testbench for my work.  You can use it as a stand-alone project to generate a picture frame with text (or without).\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:54020\r\n\r\nAdding Celtic knot elements to that, my Celtic Picture Frame is an early result of these experiments.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:55464 \r\n\r\nI have more ideas and enhancements that I hope to share later.  The script is is in a usable state now, so give it a try!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: 2012 Mar 6 -- version 1.1. uploaded to fix bugs in the utility function ReadCurveControls()"
