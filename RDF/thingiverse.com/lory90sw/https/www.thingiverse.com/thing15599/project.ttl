\r
The Premises\r
\r
The RepRap Prusa has an intuitive design and a system of simple and easy assembly, the plastic parts that make up the structure are easy to handle and require no great difficulty in mounting them with the mechanical structure, and allow to obtain results even without linear bearings and other benefits . The final structure is solid and makes it easy to transport thanks to low weight.\r
\r
Bigger Dimension\r
\r
The first step was to increase the size of printable area.La structure has been developed in such a manner so as to have more space to print.\r
\r
Cheaper Structure\r
\r
Another significant change has affected the mechanical structure of the new printer.It was find a new structure that could use a smaller number of pieces and always have a solid one .Similar to the mechanical also plastic parts have also been modified where possible or completely renovated. all this has led to savings in economic terms but also in terms of time required to assemble the printer itself\r
\r
Open Design\r
\r
The structure of the new printer is made to have an open design that allow subsequent changes in every part, also the X-cart which moves the extruder-it was so designed as to be universal and can be used with any type of extruder .The 'print area is easily accessible for a heated bed or in order to analyze the subject in print a\r
\r
\r
Benefits of the model:\r
    Quick and easy to assemble Model\r
    Spare plastic Intuitive: easy to assemble and print\r
    Number less than threaded rods\r
    Number less than smooth bars\r
    Amount less hardware\r
    Belts shorter\r
    Open Design\r
    Extruder in view\r
    X-Cart is compatible with all types of extruders available\r
    Printing area easily accessible\r
    Print the objects in view\r
