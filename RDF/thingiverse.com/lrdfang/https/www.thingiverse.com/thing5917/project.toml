The biggest complaint about it was that it was solid. We wanted to be able to use it to hold stuff. So I set out to teach myself OpenSCAD and be a productive modeler and this is what came out. Due to the constraints of making it printable and having it the size I wanted, I had to make it out of several parts. I hope everyone enjoys it and post pictures of your creations as I don't have a printer yet to make it myself.\r\n\r\nOf course the Google Android Guy is a logo created and shared by Google.
