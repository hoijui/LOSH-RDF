function: "Me and my friends started looking up things to make as soon as I get my ToM. Well we fell in love with the Android guy by xtremd, thing:1902. The biggest complaint about it was that it was solid. We wanted to be able to use it to hold stuff. So I set out to teach myself OpenSCAD and be a productive modeler and this is what came out. Due to the constraints of making it printable and having it the size I wanted, I had to make it out of several parts. I hope everyone enjoys it and post pictures of your creations as I don't have a printer yet to make it myself.\r\n\r\nOf course the Google Android Guy is a logo created and shared by Google.
