    okh:function """So you have ignored the better judgement of those around you and spawned an army of creepers http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8346. Now you are locked in your room using the light from your redstone powered computer to keep you safe. As you cry like the little girl you are because you ran out of torches while trying to recover from the creeper that exploded while you were playing god. Now they are spawning themselves and you can't do anything about it. If only there was a hero to save you, but wait your 3d Printer still is working for now. That is it you can spawn a hero to save you and risk his own plastic life to save you from the demon creepers that are outside your door. There may still be hope to save you...Nothing will get rid of the shame of your girlish scream though.\r

Since having made the creeper and the interest in Minecraft items I have seen since posting it, I decided we needed a Minecraft guy. Well, to be honest I was working on the pig first but this had a higher demand and less original coding... This model is as basic as they come, no hat, glasses, no distinguishing marks of any kind. Due to the nature that is a Minecraft avatar I wanted something that could be customized. I did make a second arm model labeled the tool arm, this arm has a hole that passes through it that allows for the holding of tools and swords that are coming soon. As with my creeper model this is parametric an coded at roughly 1mm per pixel. The dimensions are below:\r
\r
Head: 8x8x8\r
Body: 8x4x12\r
Arm: 4x4x12\r
Leg: 4x4x12\r
\r
I will not post the dimensions for the tools when I get them done because coding them makes my head hurt let alone figuring out dimensions.\r
\r
This is still a work in progress because I am still developing the weapons for the model. As with the creeper and the guy these will be almost completely faithfully duplicated in a pixel to mm manor. Except when I get a wild hair to think that I can make it look better in 3d.\r
\r
Disclaimer: The Minecraft Guy and anything else related to minecraft is owned by Markus Persson aka Notch and Mojang AB. I claim no rights to anything but the wild idea to make my own creeper. I loved the game and everything they are doing so you should support them if you aren't already. \r

Note: I am putting this as a Attribution - Creative Commons license simply because I don't know what else to put it as. If anyone from Mojang has a problem with this model or the Licensing that I have set for it let me know and I will change it.\r

Update 1: The .stls provided below are at 8x scale. This makes the creeper come out to about 8 inches. I will be uploading a standardized scale .stl at a later date. As I work on the rest of a set of minecraft models I learn how huge these things are. It looks as though the animals won't print on my makerbot hence the change in scaling, when I get one that works for everything. I was not in the right mind when I started this project but the creeper keeps telling me that I must finish or he will explode. Hopefully the minecraft guy will save me when he respawns. \r
\r
Update 2: I have cleaned up the the code in the .OpenSCAD file so that way it is easier to read and edit. I have also completed the code for the full set of tools. I have uploaded the guy and all of his tools in my new standardize 5x scale. This will make it so he is the same size as the sheep and any future models.""" ;
