function = "Little Boo Peep's sheep after some crazy guy came by and punched the wool off of her. \r\n\r\nIn my continuing line of Parametric Minecraft models, I bring you the skinned sheep. This cute cuddly little guy is the first of what I believe will be the standardize size for all future models. I have found in my goal of making all the models printable on a Makerbot that 5x is the only size that will fit pretty much across the board.\r\n\r\nAs always all models are parametric using a 1 pixel to X mm design plan. Now with better coded and commented code.\r\n\r\nMinecraft is not mine, it is property of the wonderful Notch. I just design these interpretations of the mobs. If you like minecraft or want to try it please support Mojang and Notch, by buying the game they deserve it."
