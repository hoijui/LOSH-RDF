\r
In my continuing line of Parametric Minecraft models, I bring you the regular sheep. This cute cuddly little guy is the wooled cousin of my last model. Now you can print your sheep with or with-out wool\r
\r
As always all models are parametric using a 1 pixel to X mm design plan. Now with better coded and commented code.\r
\r
Minecraft is not mine, it is property of the wonderful Notch. I just design these interpretations of the mobs. If you like minecraft or want to try it please support Mojang and Notch, by buying the game they deserve it.""" ;
