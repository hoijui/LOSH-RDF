function = "Replacement extractor for removing the fill tube from an iSi soda siphon or seltzer bottle. \r\n\r\nWorks best with a spoon through the handle to provide better grip.  I couldn't print a bigger handle on my print bed.  Will fit on 150x150 bed.\r\n\r\nThe large version is the same except for having a bigger handle that you can actually grip sufficiently to remove the fill tube."
