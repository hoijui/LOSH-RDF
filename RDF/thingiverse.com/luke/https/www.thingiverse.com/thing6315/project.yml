function: "This is my first Thing ever uploaded to Thingiverse, so it seemed appropriate. Can't wait to see if anyone prints it out. It should be a snug fit on the build platform of the MakerBot if I copied down the specs correctly. Oh and if someone wants to send me a printed copy to show me what a MakerBot can do that would be awesome, too.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the coordinate system didn't export properly and it is showing up upside-down."
