function = "This is a variation of tonokip's Mendel Feet with rubber stoppers added. The aim is to reduce the transmission of vibrations to the bench.\r\n\r\nThe stoppers I used are the type you might find on the feet of a metal frame chair. The ones I have are 16mm internal diameter and about 20mm internal depth. The scad is parametric for diameter and depth so you can fit it to your stoppers.\r\n\r\nThe clamp is unchanged from tonokip's thing."
