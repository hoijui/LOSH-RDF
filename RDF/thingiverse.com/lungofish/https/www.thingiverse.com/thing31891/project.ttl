\r
Ok, maybe the Kenner Millenium Falcon was cooler, but that point is debatable. \r
\r
Anyway, it was a very cool looking spaceship with a very nifty electronics package and a whole bunch of little plastic parts that tended to fall off and disappear forever.\r
\r
This is one of those parts, one of two smaller thrusters that go on either side of the main engine. Star Birds available on ebay are frequently missing one or both of these parts.""" ;
