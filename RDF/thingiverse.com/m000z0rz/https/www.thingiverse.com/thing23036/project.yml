function: Hasbro's Iron Man 2 Movie Series figures (http://www.itsalltrue.net/?page_id=4334) come with with a base that holds the figures its card for display. The card is actually a set of three cards - one background with the torso, and two transparencies with the head/arms and legs. There's a little bit of separation between the cards in the stand that gives it a cool hologram effect, but this effect gets dampened by the cards' tendency to stick together at the top. I whipped up a piece to put on top the cards and hold them apart to enhance the effect. The silver PLA that came with my Ultimaker mathes the base quite well!
