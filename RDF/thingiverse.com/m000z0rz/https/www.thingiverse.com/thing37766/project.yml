function: "Fixed version of dgwilson's http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14533#\r\n\r\nThe stamps both had holes in them and wouldn't slice properly. I ran them through netfabb's cloud service as BrazenArtifice suggested in the comments to clean them up, and then they sliced correctly.\r\n\r\nSo, this thing is just the original cutters from dgwilson's original design, and the fixed version of the stamps from netfabb's cloud service."
