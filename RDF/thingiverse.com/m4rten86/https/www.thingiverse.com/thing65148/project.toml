function = "This is an invention to cool down the plastic that comes out of the hot end with cool enviromental air ( room temperature). This is very good for printing small objects faster. Also I experienced that it's possible to print about 30mm in horizontal direction.   \nSo you can setup the bridge distance in slic3r to a bigger distance and it's easier to remove these after printing :-)   \n\nThe electric controll is based on the Gcode conrolled Fan Mod of Ian Johnson (http://solidoodletips.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/gcode-controlled-extruder-fan/)  \nbut instead of a Fan i used a relais that switches an air pump for aquaria. there are really cheap ones for only 10Euro ( about 13$).   \n\nI designed the Tubes (i wasnt supposed to look like .... ! :D ) and they really fit very well with a glue simply made of Aceton and ABS plastic.  \nAlso it looks good when you paint them in copper or iron colours. ;-)"
