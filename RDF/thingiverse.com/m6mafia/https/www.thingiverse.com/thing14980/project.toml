function = "3/6/2012 Update: I just uploaded a beta of the new version now with centering and initial Slic3r layer support. There still significant issues with this version so I continue to suggest you use v3 unless you need  centering or buggy slic3r support.\r\n\r\nHey guys! This is a gcode viewer for makerbot (3D) and 5D gcode written in processing. It's open-source and still a work in progress so if you would like to help out feel free to look at the git: https://github.com/nmsl1993/ProcessingGcodeViewer. It supports viewing dualextrusion prints colored correctly. Comment with any feature requests you have.\r\n\r\nYou should probably have a discrete gpu to use this; integrated graphics work but it'll be realllllly slow.\r\n\r\nThanks:\r\nI realized this needed to be done while working at makerbot and listening to Ben Rockhold constantly bragging about pleasant3D (which is OSX-only and closed-source). So I guess he's largely responsible.\r\n\r\nInspirations I had for this:\r\nPleasant3D http://www.pleasantsoftware.com/developer/pleasant3d/\r\nMakerbot's ToolPathViz https://github.com/makerbot/ToolPathViz"
