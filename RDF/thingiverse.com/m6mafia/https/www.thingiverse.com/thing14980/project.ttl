Hey guys! This is a gcode viewer for makerbot (3D) and 5D gcode written in processing. It's open-source and still a work in progress so if you would like to help out feel free to look at the git: https://github.com/nmsl1993/ProcessingGcodeViewer. It supports viewing dualextrusion prints colored correctly. Comment with any feature requests you have.\r
\r
You should probably have a discrete gpu to use this; integrated graphics work but it'll be realllllly slow.\r
\r
Thanks:\r
I realized this needed to be done while working at makerbot and listening to Ben Rockhold constantly bragging about pleasant3D (which is OSX-only and closed-source). So I guess he's largely responsible.\r

Inspirations I had for this:\r
