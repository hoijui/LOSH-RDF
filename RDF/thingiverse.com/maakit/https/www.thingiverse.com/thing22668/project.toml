function = "For those in need of a letter scale.\r\nI really like the real-world-use-things and couldn't find a letter scale on thingiverse.\r\n\r\nThought about adding a scale, but it will be too dependant on printer settings, material and counter weights, so just use a (semi-) permanent marker for this.\r\n\r\nFor the small scale I used mr alligator as a letter holder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13612\r\nHad to \"fix\" it using Netfabb before I could import it in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nI've also uploaded a version2, the largest I can get it with my 180x200mm buildplate. I've made three stl's with all the parts to print.\r\nThe black & yellow scale is version 2. I recommend to make the weighing platform a little thinner, so it won't need as much counterweights.\r\n\r\nMade it a work in progress again, I think it's better to shorten the arms holding the letter plate.\r\nI would like the big scale to be good for 250 grams.\r\nMake the scale more stable by moving the foot to the heavy side.\r\n\r\nFor the final version 3 I added some stability by moving the legs to the heavy side of the scale and making them bigger. I added another arm to hold counterweights so these are balanced. Smaller connecting arms so it can take more weight, but also makes it much more stable."
