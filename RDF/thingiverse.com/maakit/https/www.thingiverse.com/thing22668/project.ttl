I really like the real-world-use-things and couldn't find a letter scale on thingiverse.\r
\r
Thought about adding a scale, but it will be too dependant on printer settings, material and counter weights, so just use a (semi-) permanent marker for this.\r
\r
For the small scale I used mr alligator as a letter holder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13612\r
Had to "fix" it using Netfabb before I could import it in OpenSCAD.\r
\r
I've also uploaded a version2, the largest I can get it with my 180x200mm buildplate. I've made three stl's with all the parts to print.\r
The black & yellow scale is version 2. I recommend to make the weighing platform a little thinner, so it won't need as much counterweights.\r
\r
Made it a work in progress again, I think it's better to shorten the arms holding the letter plate.\r
I would like the big scale to be good for 250 grams.\r
Make the scale more stable by moving the foot to the heavy side.\r
\r
For the final version 3 I added some stability by moving the legs to the heavy side of the scale and making them bigger. I added another arm to hold counterweights so these are balanced. Smaller connecting arms so it can take more weight, but also makes it much more stable.""" ;
