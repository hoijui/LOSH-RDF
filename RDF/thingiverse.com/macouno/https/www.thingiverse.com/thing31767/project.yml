function: "Blu is a small character I designed back in 2010. He was made as a base model for a Blender 3D course.  \n\nBTW: Blu features on the official [Blender for 3D Printing](http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/product_info_n.php?products_id=160) dvd I released with the Blender foundation.  \n\nI've been using the model for lots of different projects since, and as a starting point for a multitude of other characters (Dorus the dragon for instance).  \n\nThis version has been modified specifically for the Makerbot Replicator. It prints in one go without special support.   \n\nThe really big version was printed at the http://www.protospace.nl fablab in Utrecht (Netherlands) on a really tall Ultimaker. Thanks for letting me use it! And Harma for the help printing!"
