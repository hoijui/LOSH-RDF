function: "This is a sitting version of Gree. As with the other versions of Blu and Gree he can be printed without support (but only just).\r\n\r\nThe big version is: 7.4x9.8x13.3 cm or 2.9x3.9x5.2inch\r\nThe regular size version is half that: 3.7x4.9x6.7cm or 1.5x1.9x2.6inch\r\n\r\nMake sure you print the right one! (And share a picture)\r\n\r\nI also added the original Blender 3D file. That should make it easier to make derivatives.\r\n\r\nSupport my work by getting something printed by me: http://www.etsy.com/shop/macouno\r\n\r\np.s. Thanks for the feature guys!!"
