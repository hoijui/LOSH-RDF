So I created an open source Christmas Ornament.  \n\nIt is a ball with holes cut out in the shapes of some of the biggest open source programs.  \n\nLinux  \nOpen Office  \nFirefox  \nBlender  \nThe Gimp  \nVLC  \n\nThe pictures attached to this post are of a print I had made by shapeways. I don't dare print this thing on my makerbot... it would take a lot of support. But I'd love to see if it can be done!  \n\nI also uploaded the original Blender file to make it easier for you to make derivatives.  \n\nYou can support my work by buying one from my shapeways shop: http://shpws.me/mLcG"
