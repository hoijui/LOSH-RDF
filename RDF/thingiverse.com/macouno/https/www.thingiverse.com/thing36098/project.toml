function = "With this version I have completed all of the basic poses for the characters Blu & Gree. They can now Stand, Sit & Walk. Of course I can make them do lots of other things as well... and I plan to, but these are the basic ones.\r\n\r\nThis version of Gree is a bit more dynamic than the Walking version of Blu... He has more tilted hips and shoulders, making his post more natural.\r\n\r\nYou can support my work by buying a Gree, Blu or something else from my Etsy shop: http://www.etsy.com/shop/macouno"
