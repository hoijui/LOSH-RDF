    okh:function """Lisa is derived from:  
**Elvis, the Printable(?) Skull** by HPaul  
which is derived from:  
**Cleaned Hollow Skull** by ssd  
which is derived from:  
**Skull** by bothacker  
Looking at the skull, I found that the question mark in the title of the model was there for a reason, so I thought I'd take it yet another step further away from the original scan.  
I then also downloaded the Human Skull scan from mechadense: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36140  
I decimated that one somewhat and placed it over my skull for comparison. Then made a bunch of changes to the face/jaw area.  
**I updated all the files after looking at the second skull scan!**  
Lisa is not as much a cleanup of the original as a complete remodel. She is very very basic.. so much so that she really should be considered an "artistic interpretation". But is fully printable!  
To check for printability I wrote a small Blender addon which I will include as well (the python script). It generated "vertex colours" to show where on your model the polygons have troublesome angles for extrusion printers.  
This version is exactly 5.3cm tall.  
I also included the Blender file so it's very easy to make derivatives. I'd love to see where you all will take it next!!!
