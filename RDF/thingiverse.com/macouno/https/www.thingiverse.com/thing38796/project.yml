function: "This is an alternative spool mount for the Makerbot Replicator 1 (for wider spools with smaller holes).\r\n\r\nJust yesterday I visited the http://www.protospace.nl fablab in Utrecht (Netherlands). And they had a lot of Ultimaker printers working with PLA. And well... the air was a LOT fresher than in my studio when I print with ABS. Since I already had a roll of PLA, I decided I wanted to give that a go.\r\n\r\nSadly.. the roll was a different size than the ones from Makerbot. So I figured I'd use some of the ABS I still had mounted to create a new mount.\r\n\r\nThis mount is much thinner than the original ones on my Makerbot Replicator 1.\r\nIt works with rolls that have a hole diameter of 3 centimeters (1.18inch)\r\nAnd the roll has to be 9cm thick (3.54inch)\r\n\r\nI included my Blender 3D file so it's easy to modify the source to fit whatever roll you need. I printed it in two halves and there are some small holes in the design to attach the halves using tie-wraps."
