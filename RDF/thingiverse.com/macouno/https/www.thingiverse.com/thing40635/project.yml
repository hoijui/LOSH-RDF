function: "I made Dorus a while back, based on my little Blu character (same feet!).  \n\nIf you like Dorus... Also meet his buddy [Manus the Minotaur!](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:98916)  \n\nYou can help me make more free stuff by buying a full colour Dorus via [my shop at Shapeways](http://shpws.me/ln4a)  \n\nBTW: Dorus features on the official [Blender for 3D Printing](http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/product_info_n.php?products_id=160) dvd I released with the Blender foundation.  \n\nThe initial model was unstable, and couldn't be printed on an extrusion printer.  \n\nSo now... say hello to Supportless Dorus. I modified him specifically so he can be printed in one go on my Replicator 1. I'm pretty sure he can be printed on any machine."
