function: "This is a small Bird Feeder that uses Peanut butter and an Ikea pencil.  \n.  \nYou can hang it with a screw or with two tie wraps (there are slots on the back)  \n.  \n[UPDATE] MAN... the birds love the peanut butter!!! Every kind of bird stops by as soon as we fill it. It took a week before they caught on... but boy... I'm amazed! [/UPDATE]"
