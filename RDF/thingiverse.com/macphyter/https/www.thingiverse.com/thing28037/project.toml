function = "This is a replica of the safety latch by EliteNetworks.  I eliminated the corner brace so that it will print well without support. I also countersunk the screw holes so it works well with standard wood screws.  \n\nUpdate:  I rounded off the sharp tip because it was too poky.  I also added a fillet in the corner to relieve the stress and make it less prone to break off.  New version is mylock3.scad."
