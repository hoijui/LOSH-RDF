function = "to use an external power supply. there is a small rubber cover in the hinged door of the camera. underneath sits a 6mm hole where the cable can go trough. Use a VERY small connector. i strip the cable for about 5cm and tin it completely. then I begin on the bottom and bending them around the edge. negative/black goes near the corner, positive/red to the center. You have to measure a few times so the stripped part ends near the big hole. there you can make a knot. bond the tinned wires to the case with a soldering iron. then apply 4.3 volts, 1A minimum to the wires and you are up and running.\r\n\r\nver     date      comment\r\n1.0   03-09-2011   initial version\r\n1.1   03-09-2011   increased curve resolution\r\n1.2   04-09-2011   used union() initial print\r\n1.3   10-09-2011   corrected round holes. output hole smaller, bottom of big hole thicker, increased small hole size for the contact wire"
