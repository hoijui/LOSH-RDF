function = "Ok I'm writing this all for a second time as I accidentally deleted evrything. Noooooooooooo. \r\n\r\nThis mod doubles the X Y axisâ€™s accuracy on Reprap Mendel. It does this by creating a double pulley system. I have noticed that there is significantly less lash on my x axis now and everything seems to move more sharply. Another benefit is this mod allows your machine to run at exactly the same speed as before. \r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/vVHvbCfxZdU  \r\n\r\nYou can see the first test here and get a good idea of how it goes together. The only difference now is the Y belts brackets have all captured knuts and countersunk bolts."
