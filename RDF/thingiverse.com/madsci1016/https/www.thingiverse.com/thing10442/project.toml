function = "So this is my first designed thing ever and it was to fix my computer chair. \r\n\r\nI have a nice comfy computer chair, except recently the height adjustment cylinder no longer holds pressure and it slowly falls over the course of a few minutes. It's very annoying as I can't comfortable use the computer with the chair low and have to raise it again repeatedly. So I designed a piece to snap onto the bar shaft and keep it from collapsing. \r\n\r\nI doubt this will help many others but figured I'd post it just in case. Design file attached if anyone wants to mod the size for their own chair. Be warned, I only had about 1 hour of tutorial watching before I designed this. Still cutting my teeth on this whole 3D design thing."
