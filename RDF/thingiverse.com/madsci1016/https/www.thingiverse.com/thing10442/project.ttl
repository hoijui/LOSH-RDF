    okh:function """So this is my first designed thing ever and it was to fix my computer chair. \r
\r
I have a nice comfy computer chair, except recently the height adjustment cylinder no longer holds pressure and it slowly falls over the course of a few minutes. It's very annoying as I can't comfortable use the computer with the chair low and have to raise it again repeatedly. So I designed a piece to snap onto the bar shaft and keep it from collapsing. \r
\r
I doubt this will help many others but figured I'd post it just in case. Design file attached if anyone wants to mod the size for their own chair. Be warned, I only had about 1 hour of tutorial watching before I designed this. Still cutting my teeth on this whole 3D design thing.""" ;
