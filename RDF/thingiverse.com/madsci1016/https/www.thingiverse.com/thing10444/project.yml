function: "My second designed thing ever, useless for anyone else on here (most likely).\r\n\r\nSomething to make up for all that time I've spent on the computer playing with this new-fangled 3D printer. Fortunately, I won my TOM, so I don't have to make up for the cost. But I do sink a lot of 'our' money on plastic and other projects, sometimes for a good cause. See http://www.sciencebrothers.org\r\n\r\nOnly have an hour's worth of tutorial watching and practice on Inventor so I'm sure it could be improved but regardless the design file is attached. I'm guessing the name could be changed easily?"
