\r
I then proceed to give myself a crash course in 3D design using AutoDesk Inventor (free for students). This guy's video tutorial series is great: http://www.youtube.com/user/robcohee\r
\r
Anyway so this is a Thank You to them for being awesome and hosting such a great contest. I encourage people to give their blog a check out. I am certainly a loyal reader!\r

I'm a little stumped by Inventor as it doesn't let you extrude text directly. I had to 'reverse emboss' it onto an existing 3D object, then 'cut extrude' another background 3D object to remove the one I had to create to emboss text. Kinda backwards it seems to me. Does anyone have a better solution for 3D text in Inventor?""" ;
