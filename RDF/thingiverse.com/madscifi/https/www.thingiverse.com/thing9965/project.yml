function: "This is a variation of the Tiny Toy Dump Truck that does require support in order to print. The use of support allows cylindrical wheels, a bed axle sleeve that is no longer sliced, and the addition of a cam and rod that lifts the bed once per rotation of the back axle.\r\n\r\nIt can be printed as a single piece on a standard Reprap/Makerbot by manually introducing support material during the print.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47iEXR6xXnE for a video of a working copy that was printed on a standard Reprap."
