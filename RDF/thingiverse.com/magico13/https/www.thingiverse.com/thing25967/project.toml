function = "This is an icon of the Earth Kingdom from Avatar the Last Airbender to be printed on a 3d printer. It could be used for a necklace, or a keychain. Whatever you like. The whole thing is 30mmx30mm with 3 mm high edges and the design is raised 1mm. If this is too low, let me know and I'll make one with larger raises.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The first version didn't print at all so I'm uploading a revised version which I can confirm prints. It's a bit small, so you may want to scale it. I'm also including the sketchup file for anyone who wants it."
