function = "This is an adjustable wall mount for your monitor. It has a 100 x 100 and a 75 x 75 pattern to attach your standard mount. Simply print and connect with 8mm x 50mm socket head cap screws and a 8mm nut at each connection. You may need to file the connections to get them to fit into each other, I was trying to keep them tight to reduce drooping.\r\n\r\nI do not know what type of capacity that it has. My monitor has not fallen off the wall yet. that is the only endorsement I can give. :)\r\n\r\nUpdate 9/10/12\r\nMy monitor is still hanging on the wall without issue :)"
