    okh:function """This is an adjustable wall mount for your monitor. It has a 100 x 100 and a 75 x 75 pattern to attach your standard mount. Simply print and connect with 8mm x 50mm socket head cap screws and a 8mm nut at each connection. You may need to file the connections to get them to fit into each other, I was trying to keep them tight to reduce drooping.\r
\r
I do not know what type of capacity that it has. My monitor has not fallen off the wall yet. that is the only endorsement I can give. :)\r
\r
Update 9/10/12\r
My monitor is still hanging on the wall without issue :)""" ;
