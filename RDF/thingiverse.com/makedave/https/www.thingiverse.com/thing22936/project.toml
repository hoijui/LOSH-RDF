function = "I was headed out for vacation and wanted a timer for the light on the front of my house. So I made one with stuff I had laying around. \r\n\r\nIt is a very simple servo project with an arduino board to control it. The time program I created will turn on the light as soon as you turn it on wait 4 hours and turn the light off for 20 hours. (These are all very approximate the way I did the programming, as I was not after accuracy.) After a 2 week vacation it was off by about an hour, but hey close enough. :)"
