    okh:function """I purchased a MK7ish extruder and could not get it to extrude consistently. All of the boards were talking about the whosawhatsis' Minimalistic Mk7 replacement. That design inspired me to make a new design with the same basic concepts but much more compact. And a simple push button to release the plastic.\r
\r
I have not gotten a lot of mile on it yet, but it seems to work pretty well so far.\r
\r
Let me know if there are any issues getting this to work on an official makerbot MK7/8. As I bought mine form another company.""" ;
