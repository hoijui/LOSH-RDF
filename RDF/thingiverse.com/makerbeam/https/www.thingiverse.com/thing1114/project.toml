function = "This should tie two MakerBeams together; I say 'should' because it's yet to be printed. \r\n\r\nI recommend scaling up all models by a factor of 1.5 if you want to print and play right now. The 15x15mm scale is clearly better for current 3-d printing technology, being both stronger and in possession of a clearly formed slot. Erik de Bruijn has been attaching those profiles together with 3M nuts and bolts, and we look forward to seeing what comes of that."
