function = "So I got a waterproof case made by Lifeproof for my iPhone 5. The case is great but it's too big to fit in the armband I use for running. Lifeproof hasn't released a compatible armband yet so I designed my own. This is the third version (first published) of this case and I'm quite happy with it. The phone fits in perfectly and doesn't move once in place. It removes easily when your run is done. Additionally, all controls are still accessable!"
