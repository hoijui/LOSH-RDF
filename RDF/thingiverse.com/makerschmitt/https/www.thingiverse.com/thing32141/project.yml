function: "20 spaceships print out at once.  This will get you an armada quickly.  They make great little toys for kids. \r\n\r\nMy kids use them as replacement pieces in board games, as well as making fun \"space armada battles\" with some imagination.  \r\n\r\n\"Pew-pew-pew\" sounds sold separately (make your own)."
