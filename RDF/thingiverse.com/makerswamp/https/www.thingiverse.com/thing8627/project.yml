function: "I bought a tripod for $9 from a swap meet as I wanted to use it with my dslr. However, it was missing the quick release plate that attaches to the base of the camera and slots into the tripod.\r\n\r\nI decided this was a great challenge for my 3D printer so I crafted one in openscad (file to follow when I can find it).\r\n\r\nOne of the dimensions is a bit too long (I believe the basic insert shape should be a square but I ran out of plastic to retry.)"
