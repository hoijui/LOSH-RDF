function: ">This Thing is now for reference and/or inspiration.  \n>See the next version of this Thing at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:448686  \n>Thank You!   \n>9/1/14  \nI own a MakerBot Thing-o-Matic but wanted a second 3D printer that worked the same way.  Along came the discovery of MakerSlide so using MakerBot Gen4 Electronics/MakerBot parts on MakerSlide/Misumi and 80/20 extrusions, I present to you this 3D printer variant.  \nI have a working version but still trying to figure out how to mount the electronics.  This is my second attempt with revised parts which I have posted.  \nUpdate 03/29/12 - Added more SKP files."
