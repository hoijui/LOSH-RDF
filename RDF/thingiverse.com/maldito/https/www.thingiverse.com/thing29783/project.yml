function: The mount that is part of Heavy duty printable filament spool, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10219, didn't work for me. I figured that it may not work or others so I threw one together in openscad. I didn't find any scad files to start with so I created a fresh one. It's my first openscad creation, so forgive any noob errors.
