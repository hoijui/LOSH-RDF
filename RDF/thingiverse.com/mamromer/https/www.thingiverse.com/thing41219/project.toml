function = "This hexacopter is my first attempt to build one from scratch. Everything except the electronics is printed.\r\n\r\nThe bare frame weighs about 100-110 grams.\r\nAs you can see the build is not yet complete but the plastic parts are, so why not share it with you.\r\n\r\nNote 18022013:  I have changed the motor arm and stand a bit for more stability (V2). I hope I can add a first flight video next week (still waiting for parts...)."
