function: "This is a printable Hexapod. It is still not very stable and still learning to walk, but it is a good start. It needs some changes in the leg design as sometimes they bend under the weight.\r\nThe initial design is based on : \r\nhttp://robozone.su/forum/textversion.html?t58\r\n\r\nThe changes I have done are the additions described below and also decrease the size of the Body plates to fit a standard Mendel.\r\n\r\nAnd I am currently using this software to control it: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.hexapodrobot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=160\r\n\r\nBe aware that the hexapod is still not very stable (legs bending) and that is why it is work in progress."
