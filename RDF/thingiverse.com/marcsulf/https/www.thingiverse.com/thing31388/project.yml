function: "EDIT: 5-Feb-2013: I found and error in my algebra for calculating the curve.  It is now fixed, and should work correctly in the customizer.\r\n\r\nThis is a catch for a child-resistant magnet operated cabinet latch, similar to the one found here: https://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Magnetic-Deluxe-Starter/dp/B0000488W2 .  I broke a couple of them while using them in non-conventional ways, so I needed a few extras, and I didn't want to buy a whole new kit to get them."
