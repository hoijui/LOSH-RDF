function: As the title says, this is a fully parametric case for an HTC MyTouch 3G phone.  I have printed this out for my wife's phone, and it works great.  I know this is a really old phone, but I figured by putting up the .SCAD file, others might be able to modify it for their own phones if they are similar enough.
