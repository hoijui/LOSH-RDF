function = "This is a modification to the Huxley feet filament holder by AndrewCraigie.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to quickly and easily remove the filament holder from the frame without messing around with nuts and washers (if like me you have fitted extra nuts to keep things in place) so you can more easily load new filament.\r\n\r\nRefitting is quick and easy and the filament holder is retained securely with a printed face plate and wing nuts."
