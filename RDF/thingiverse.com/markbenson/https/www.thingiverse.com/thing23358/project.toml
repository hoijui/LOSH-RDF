function = "A set of clips and stand offs for fitting a 120mm fan to a reprappro Huxley.\r\n\r\nI had a bunch of these 120mm fans kicking around and hooked one up to the spare mosfet on the Sanguinololu controller to try and improve the quality of my prints when printing small parts and bridges. The fan seems to work a treat with PLA on the Huxley and is automatically controlled by slic3r so I decided to make it a permanent fixture."
