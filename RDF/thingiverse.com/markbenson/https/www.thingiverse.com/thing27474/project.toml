And if he is cute, then by anthropomorphic extension he is good... right? \r\n\r\nBut where is his evil nemesis? Doesn't it work like this: Where there is good there is bad, where there is light there is dark etc etc?\r\n\r\nWell here he is. Evil Luxo Jr.\r\n\r\nI can only appologise for unleashing Evil Luxo Jr on the world. Pray that he doesn't destroy you (and your 3d printer)."
