\r
The unpacked model shows the normal lung capacity of about 4.6L. The packed model shows a technique to force air into the lungs that increased the capacity to 11.9L.\r
\r
Both models were created from the same person and are proportionally correct.\r
\r
As a guide orientation the lungs are very close to each other at the front and are separated by the spine at the back""" ;
