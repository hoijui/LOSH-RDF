function: "These models were created from 3d medical images of a champion free-diver http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-diving ie someone who can hold their breath for a very long time. \r\n\r\nThe unpacked model shows the normal lung capacity of about 4.6L. The packed model shows a technique to force air into the lungs that increased the capacity to 11.9L.\r\n\r\nBoth models were created from the same person and are proportionally correct.\r\n\r\nAs a guide orientation the lungs are very close to each other at the front and are separated by the spine at the back"
