function = "This is a custom rig to secure a little key-chain 720p video camera (recording to MicroSD) to the body of a hobby rocket. The current model should fit a 34mm diameter hobby rocket that uses E class engines. \r\n\r\nI originally downloaded a model of the standard Key-chain 720p video camera from Thingiverse last year but forget who to credit. I used that model as a hole to create this one."
