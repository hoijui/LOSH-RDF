function = "This is a little rig that connects to a common type of mobile / cell phone mount on one side (via the 4 little lugs) and to Lego Mindstorms pieces on the other side. \r\n\r\nThe purpose is to securely mount your mobile phone to your Lego Mindstorms robot - I've used this to create a remote operated telepresence robot for example. \r\n\r\nI downloaded a 3-brick Lego piece model from Thingiverse last year to help make this but forget who to credit."
