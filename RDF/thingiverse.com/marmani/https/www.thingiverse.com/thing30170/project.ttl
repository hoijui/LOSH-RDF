Are you biking or jogging, and want your phone firmly held by your waist so it doesn't bounce around?  \r

This is a tight belt-clip for the Samsung Galaxy S3! (the S has a restricted symbol by it).  It was made online in Tinkercad, which owns Sketchup as a quick design tool!  Its probably compatible with other phones, but I can not be sure.  I printed mine with PLA at 220 degC, .25 mm layer height, at 40 mm/s, it took 1 hour to print in full fill on a prusa mendel.\r
\r
You can clip it on your belt or the V-neck of your shirt because it is so light.  Then you clip in the phone sideways (over the top may not be safe due to roughness).  Be careful to not scratch your phone - see notes.""" ;
