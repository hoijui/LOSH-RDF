function: "I was once a tall large man. Then I was scanned and I have been trapped inside an STL file for A LONG TIME. Thankfully, Martin Bauer let me out of this file and he has given me his name and I look like him, but I am small.\r\n\r\nI can live in your house too, that is the beauty of being converted into an STL file, if you have a 3D printer like the MakerBot, then you can give me a whole extra life. It is like when you hit that secret box in Mario Bros and get all the free lives you want. \r\n\r\nPlease, print me out on your 3D printer, take pictures of me, make me clothes... really, it can be cold being this small with the whole surface area to volume issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you print me out furniture, that would be nice. I would use it."
