function: "This is a Star topper for a desktop christmas tree. A 0.23\" diameter hole was drilled in the back of the star on center to allow for a standard christmas light to mount to it. The body of the star is hollow which allows for the light to illuminate the star with whatever color is used. \r\n\r\nThis star was made using a 3d printer which could add filler material. The main light hole and two drain holes were added in order for the filler material to dissolve when immersed in its solution."
