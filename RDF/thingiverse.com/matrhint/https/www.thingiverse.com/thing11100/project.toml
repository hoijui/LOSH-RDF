function = "Disclamer: This is no way safe or a good idea to build. Be careful when messing with electricity.\r\n\r\nI tested the circuit with an isolated variable ac power supply to test functionality and reliability. I am confident that it won't over heat or die after 24 hours of use. I used a Kill-A-Watt meter to monitor used power (3 watts). \r\n\r\nThis is supposed to be a low watt replacement for incandescent bulb types. \r\n\r\nIt is 100% safe for normal human usage."
