function: "This is a replacement for the little piece that holds the thing that keeps all of the condiment containers from being slung out of the fridge when someone opens the door. The apartment where I once lived was missing these pieces--so I made new ones.\r\nI hope that this helps someone someday if they have a simmilar problem."
