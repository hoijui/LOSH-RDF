function: This is a remake of the pulley designed by Grabercars with the gears replaced and an added hole for the drive filament to go into. There are others who have used simmilar mechanisms to control an axis. I hope to use floss with mine in order to reduce the cost of finnishing my machine and keeping the wife happy (I am sure she is getting sick of my daily trips to Fastenal).
