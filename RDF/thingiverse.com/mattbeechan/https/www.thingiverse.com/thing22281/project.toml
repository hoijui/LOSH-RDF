function = "This is a small combination of designs to make a fridge magnet that might hold keys or other such things. Designed it to use a .709\" x .197\" disc magnet, but have also included the sketch up file so you can make it mount however you please. Waiting on my printer, figured I would at least make some initial designs and get them into the wild. Please post your photos of results. Thanks."
