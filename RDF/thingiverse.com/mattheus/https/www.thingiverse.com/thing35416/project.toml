function = "There is common problem with Ultimaker that belts for X-Y axises are not tight enough. There are many belt tensioners already here, but they all static (there is no way to change force of tension). So I designed and uploaded one that can use standard Ultimaker's bolts 5x16 and nuts, easy to install and presicely control tension force."
