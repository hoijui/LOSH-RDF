function = "This is a thermal barrier retainer block I designed for my plastruder to replace the stock retainer washer, steel washer & m3 screw stack.  I also use this block to mount the plastruder to my z-stage so that's why the block is kind of long.  One surface of the block is flush with the back of the plastruder housing and has two M4 threaded holes."
