function = "The latch that holds the door to the hazard triangle compartment broke on my Audi.  I fret not because I have a 3D printer and could easily replicate a new one.  I took the broken latch, modeled it in Pro/E and then printed it in about 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe latch is from my Audi S4 Avant but I'm pretty sure it will work in other Audis as well."
