    okh:function """I have several bookshelves at home that are about 8ft in the air with neat little storage boxes on them.  Getting them down to dust is kind of a real pain and usually a lot of dust comes down with them.  I thought (in Windows 7 terms) there's got to be a better way!  I designed an attachment for our Dyson vacuum cleaner that fits between the box and sucks up all of the dust, much smarter.\r
\r
I have included the native Pro/Engineer CAD file for those of you who are lucky enough to have Pro/E, everyone else can use the attached STEP file.""" ;
