function = "I designed this headphone hanger that attaches to the rail system on my cubicle at work.  I designed it specifically for my cubicle but it may work for others, I also designed it for my AKG K701s but it should also work for other phones too.\r\n\r\nThe hanger has a bonus clip for hanging the 1/8\" phono plug.  My headphones were recabled with a switchcraft phono plug but the clip may also work wit other brand plugs.\r\n\r\nEdits:\r\n2-28-2012 - Added Native Pro/E Design Files"
