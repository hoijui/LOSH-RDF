function = "My mother purchased an EcoSphere just before Christmas.  An EcoSphere is a self sustaining mini environment containing shrimp, green algae, coral & decorative rocks.  The sphere is supposed to last for anywhere between 5-15 years.  When it arrived my mother asked me to design and print a stand for it.  I refined the design over a few weekends and completed printing it this morning.  I chose to print it in the brand new Taulman 618 Nylon because it could be dyed in any color she wanted, she chose orange.  The stand is completely hollow consisting of only 4 perimeters, the EcoSphere is held in place with some poster tack.  \n\n\n\nI have included the Pro/Engineer CAD data for those interested in modifying this design."
