    okh:function """I have a unique RepStrap and the Brutstruder mounts included in the MakerGear Geared Stepper Plastruder are not really compatable with it so I borrowed the Brutstruder design and modified it suit my needs.  I was not able to convert the Heeks CAD files to work with Pro/Engineer and ended up using my caliper to measure the one included in the kit so it's not an exact copy.\r
\r
I updated the design to use the GrooveMount insulator and made it quick change so hot end swaps take less than a minute.  I also designed an idler similar to the one Nophead designed for Wade's Geared Extruder.\r
\r
*UPDATED*\r
\r
Added ParaSolid and STEP files to download.""" ;
