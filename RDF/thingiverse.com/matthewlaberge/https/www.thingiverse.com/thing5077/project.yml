function: "I have a unique RepStrap and the Brutstruder mounts included in the MakerGear Geared Stepper Plastruder are not really compatable with it so I borrowed the Brutstruder design and modified it suit my needs.  I was not able to convert the Heeks CAD files to work with Pro/Engineer and ended up using my caliper to measure the one included in the kit so it's not an exact copy.\r\n\r\nI updated the design to use the GrooveMount insulator and made it quick change so hot end swaps take less than a minute.  I also designed an idler similar to the one Nophead designed for Wade's Geared Extruder.\r\n\r\n*UPDATED*\r\n\r\nAdded ParaSolid and STEP files to download."
