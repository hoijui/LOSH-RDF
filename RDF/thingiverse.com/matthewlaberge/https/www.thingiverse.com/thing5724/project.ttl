    okh:function """I wanted to use a MakerGear compact hotend on my newly built RepRap Mendel, the problem is the hotend is so compact that it would not reach the build platform.  So I devised this mount that captures the insulator and lowers the nozzle.  I did need to make a new Wade's M8 Extruder block because for some reason the current Wade's mount doe not center the insulator in the X Cariage opening.\r
\r
Now I know the question everyone is going to ask "won't that melt" well I have used the mount for several weeks now and it has not melted.  I have been using the hot end to extrude UltiMachine White PLA4043D at 186ËšC""" ;
