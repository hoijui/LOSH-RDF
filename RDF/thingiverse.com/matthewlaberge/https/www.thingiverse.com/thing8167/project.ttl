\r
It is a two part trap that allows you to easily clean out the dead wasps and reset the trap.  I reccomend printing it with clear or translucent PLA so you can see the dead wasps as they fill the trap, just make sure they are dead when you empty the trap or you'll probably free a bunch of pissed off wasps and that can't be good.""" ;
