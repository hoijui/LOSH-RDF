function: "A co-worker asked if it was possible to print a wasp trap with my RepStrap and like any good operator I said absolutely.  I did a little research and settled on a type of trap that I thought would be most printable and designed this.\r\n\r\nIt is a two part trap that allows you to easily clean out the dead wasps and reset the trap.  I reccomend printing it with clear or translucent PLA so you can see the dead wasps as they fill the trap, just make sure they are dead when you empty the trap or you'll probably free a bunch of pissed off wasps and that can't be good."
