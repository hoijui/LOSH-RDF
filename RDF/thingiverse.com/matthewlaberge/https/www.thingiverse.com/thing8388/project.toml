function = "My family has a tradition of making people work for cash or gift cards if they do not give a suitable suggestion for their birthday.  So this year I decided to take advantage of my 3D printer to fully encapsulate some cash for one of my cousins who is wanting to purchase an Apple iPod Touch. This \"trap\" does exactly that, it fully encapsulates either cash or a gift card so your recipient has to work at cutting or smashing out the gift."
