function: "This is a little clamp-on angle that goes onto the Z-platform of the MakerBot. It carries a 40mm diameter PC cooling fan, directed at the extruder nozzle. \r\n\r\nThe fan is supposed to quickly cool the extruded material to improve printouts. The part was designed so that a second part can be flipped and printed to carry a second fan. No beauty in this part, no industrial design, just  lot of ABS to hold a tiny cooling fan.\r\n\r\nAfter printing and testing the Thing, I found two problems: 1: the beam below the base is too thick - it needs to be cut shorter. 2: the design is fugly - I will try to remove a lot more material and finish the right bar and middle piece for the 2-fan version."
