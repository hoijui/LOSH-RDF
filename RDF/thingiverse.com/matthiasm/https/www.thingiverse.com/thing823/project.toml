function = "This is my special version of the shot glass. It has a few great features:\r\n\r\n- it is square shaped so I can spot it easily in a pile of shot glasses\r\n- it is tiny, so I don't get too drunk to print another one\r\n- it has an extra pin that tells me if one of the axes on my machine is flipped\r\n- it is water tight\r\n- it easily holds 12 year old German Brandy\r\n\r\nProst."
