function = "This is simply a support piece that clips to the top of your BFB Touch printer and allows you to mount the normal Spool holder onto it.\r\nWhy? Because I find my filament keeps snapping in the long feed tubes from the the bottom, and this lets you use a very short feed tube.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I have added a slightly longer version to accomodate larger spools."
