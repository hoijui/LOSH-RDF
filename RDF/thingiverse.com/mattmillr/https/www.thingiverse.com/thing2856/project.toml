function = "I thought this stand would look great with a vintage subway map on it. I found just the map on Wikimedia commons.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of probems with the uploaded file:\r\n\r\n(1) The left and right pieces have sections with double lines. This will run the laser over the outline twice. If you're  paying for laser time, this is 4-6 minutes you can cut out if you clean the file up.\r\n\r\n(2) The slots in the base piece are a little thin for the 1/8\" acrylic I used. In fact, both sides were tight and snapped when I forced them together. The stand you see in my pictures has generous amounts of Krazy glue holding it together.\r\n\r\n(3) The prongs on the front that keep the laptop from slipping forward are a bit short. They don't work well with the curved edges of some laptops. My MacBook Pro barely holds, my HP Pavillion and Acer Aspire both slip off.\r\n\r\nIf I can get on a computer with CorelDraw, I'll clean up the files and repost.\r\n\r\nThe original map image can be found here: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bmt1912.jpg, but I've uploaded a high-contrast version I used.\r\n\r\nMore photos here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattmillr/sets/72157623972822062/."
