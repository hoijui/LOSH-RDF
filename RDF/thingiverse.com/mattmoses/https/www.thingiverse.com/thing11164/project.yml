function: "This is an electric motor made from a printed circuit board, some 3D printed components, 44 magnets, 44 steel washers, and a handful of electronic components for drive circuitry.  \r\n\r\nIt is similar in design to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:802 but it is much easier to make and the performance is much better.  Maximum mechanical power output is about 600 mW.  Top no-load speed is about 2000 rpm.  This is probably enough power to do something useful.\r\n\r\nAlso provided is an open source script that runs on Matlab or GNU Octave to generate custom motor coil patterns.  The script will export CAM files in KiCad or EAGLE format, so you can fabricate coil patterns of your own liking.  \r\n\r\nWhile this motor used a commercially produced PCB for the coilplate, the idea is that users can produce functional motors using nothing more than their own 3D printers.  \r\n\r\nSee http://reprap.org/wiki/Automated_Circuitry_Making for an overview of using Reprap-style printers to fabricate circuit boards.\r\n\r\nVideos of the motor in operation are at\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIj4dKaEXnU\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj_GX-TvAQU\r\n\r\nThis work was presented at ASME IDETC 2011.  The paper citation is DETC2011-48602, Design of an Electromagnetic Actuator Suitable for Production by Rapid Prototyping, by Matthew Moses and Gregory S. Chirikjian"
