function: "The purpose of this experimental design is to take a step toward a more \"replicatable\" hot end. The procedures outlined here could potentially be used to make a functional hot end using basic raw materials and simple processes, without the need for precision tools such as a metal lathe or drill bits and other cutting tools.\r\n\r\nThis prototype can extrude Polycaprolactone at about 120C. \r\n\r\nThe main tube is electroformed copper.\r\n\r\nThe insulating portion is cast plaster.\r\n\r\nThe heater coil is made of enamel insulated copper wire.\r\n\r\nTemperature feedback is accomplished by measuring the resistance of the copper heater coil. \r\n\r\nElectroforming works for many metals that have desirable properties (such as nickel). The electroforming method may serve to be a useful technique for converting other 3D printed forms into metal parts."
