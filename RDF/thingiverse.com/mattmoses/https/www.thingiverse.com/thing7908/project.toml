function = "This is a parametric toy model of a piston engine, inspired by Neophyte's Air Powered Motor: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7792\r\n\r\nIt is written in OpenSCAD, so you can change all the parameters and even animate it.  It is kind of fun to animate it and change parameters on the fly.\r\n\r\nAll the parts should be easy to print.  Clearance between moving parts can be changed parametrically.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone want to add some valves and make a real one that runs off compressed air?"
