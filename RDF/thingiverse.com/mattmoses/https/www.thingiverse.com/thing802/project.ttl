    okh:function """This is a possibly-printable electric motor.  The motor can be operated as a DC motor or a stepper motor, depending on how you set it up.  We built the motor by casting plastic and metal parts, but most of the parts can probably be built with a laser cutter or a Reprap/Cupcake/Fab@home type machine.  It runs at about 400rpm at a voltage of 6V and a current draw of 7A (yes, seven amps).  \r

You can see a video of the motor in operation at  \r

Before you try to make the motor, you should understand what it is and is not.  \r
\r
*It IS* An experimental design that you can build, try out, and hopefully improve so it does something useful for you.  \r
\r
*It IS NOT* An inexpensive alternative to an off-the-shelf motor.  If you need a motor you can put in your project, go buy a motor.  This motor is very inefficient, produces low output power, and takes a lot of work to build.""" ;
