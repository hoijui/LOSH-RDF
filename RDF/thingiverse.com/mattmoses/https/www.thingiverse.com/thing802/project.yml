function: "This is a possibly-printable electric motor.  The motor can be operated as a DC motor or a stepper motor, depending on how you set it up.  We built the motor by casting plastic and metal parts, but most of the parts can probably be built with a laser cutter or a Reprap/Cupcake/Fab@home type machine.  It runs at about 400rpm at a voltage of 6V and a current draw of 7A (yes, seven amps).  \r\n\r\nYou can see a video of the motor in operation at  \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSAof007cS4  \r\n\r\nA video of the first prototype, which is easier to make, is at  \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHML3gVQ-uU  \r\n\r\nFor more info, also check out our paper  \r\nTowards cyclic fabrication systems for modular robotics and rapid manufacturing, by M.S. Moses, H. Yamaguchi, and G.S. Chirikjian.  Proceedings of Robotics: Science and Systems, June 2009.  \r\nhttps://rpk.lcsr.jhu.edu/Publications#Robotic_Self-Replication  \r\n\r\nBefore you try to make the motor, you should understand what it is and is not.  \r\n\r\n*It IS* An experimental design that you can build, try out, and hopefully improve so it does something useful for you.  \r\n\r\n*It IS NOT* An inexpensive alternative to an off-the-shelf motor.  If you need a motor you can put in your project, go buy a motor.  This motor is very inefficient, produces low output power, and takes a lot of work to build."
