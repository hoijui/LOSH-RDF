function = "A Roots Blower is an air pump with strangely shaped rotors.  They are used in automotive superchargers and high-vacuum pumps, among other places.\r\n\r\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_type_supercharger\r\n\r\nThis is a stand-alone Public Domain OpenSCAD file you can use to generate these mechanisms.  This is intended more as an example of an interesting mechanism than as a useful pump.\r\n\r\nThe file uses code appropriated from \r\nLeemon Baird's PublicDomainGearV1.1.scad\r\nwhich can be found here:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5505"
