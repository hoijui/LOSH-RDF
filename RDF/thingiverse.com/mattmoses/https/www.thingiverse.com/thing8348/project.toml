function = "By request of Syvwlch ( http://www.thingiverse.com/syvwlch ) and WilliamAAdams ( http://www.thingiverse.com/WilliamAAdams ), here is a stand-alone public-domain OpenSCAD cycloidal speed reducer.  As with the Wankel Engine and Roots Blower I recently posted, this is intended more as an example of an interesting mechanism than as a practical device.  If you want a practical printable speed reducer, you might consider one of the other alternatives like\r\n\r\nthe worm drives on this Tank http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8080 or\r\ndifferential planetary gears http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7390 or\r\ncascaded spur gears http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7379 or\r\nthis planetary gear reducer http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8460\r\n\r\nThere are several cycloidal-type mechanisms already on Thingiverse, such as\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3617 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3736\r\n\r\nThere are also several interesting external sites like:\r\nhttp://www.zincland.com/hypocycloid/\r\nhttp://fabricationsofthemind.com/2010/07/09/extruder-design-1-printable-1001-hypocycloidal-gearbox/\r\nhttps://github.com/triffid/Differential_Hypocycloid\r\nhttp://reprap.org/wiki/Differential_Hypocycloid\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerotor\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_pump\r\n\r\nand many many interesting youtube videos such as\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRn1K2XeWVE\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WvPF6uGCq4\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG2sPuqEXBg\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMtyFwMDL7w\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h236SP86nnQ\r\n\r\nThis present script is based on a design by M.F. Hill described in his 1928 patent \"Internal Rotor\", number 1,682,563: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com/patents/about?id=mdF5AAAAEBAJ&dq=1682563\r\n\r\nNote that this design is based on an offset hypocycloid, similar to Figure I in Hill's patent.  Most of the contemporary designs appear to be based on an offset epicycloid, more closely resembling Figure V in the patent.  \r\n\r\nThe motivated student can modify the code so it generates epicycloidal-based profiles.  Hint: start by making a module ``epitrochoidBandFast(n, r, thickness, r_off)\".  The motivated student could also probably clean up my train-wreck of code and/or figure out how to do arrays in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nNote also that these rotors can be used for pumps - see the gifs in the comments for an example."
