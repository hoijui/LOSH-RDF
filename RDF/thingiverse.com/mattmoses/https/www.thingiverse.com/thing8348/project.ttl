    okh:function """By request of Syvwlch ( http://www.thingiverse.com/syvwlch ) and WilliamAAdams ( http://www.thingiverse.com/WilliamAAdams ), here is a stand-alone public-domain OpenSCAD cycloidal speed reducer.  As with the Wankel Engine and Roots Blower I recently posted, this is intended more as an example of an interesting mechanism than as a practical device.  If you want a practical printable speed reducer, you might consider one of the other alternatives like\r
\r
the worm drives on this Tank http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8080 or\r
differential planetary gears http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7390 or\r
cascaded spur gears http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7379 or\r
this planetary gear reducer http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8460\r
\r
There are several cycloidal-type mechanisms already on Thingiverse, such as\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3617 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3736\r

There are also several interesting external sites like:\r

This present script is based on a design by M.F. Hill described in his 1928 patent "Internal Rotor", number 1,682,563: \r
\r
http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=mdF5AAAAEBAJ&dq=1682563\r
\r
Note that this design is based on an offset hypocycloid, similar to Figure I in Hill's patent.  Most of the contemporary designs appear to be based on an offset epicycloid, more closely resembling Figure V in the patent.  \r
\r
The motivated student can modify the code so it generates epicycloidal-based profiles.  Hint: start by making a module ``epitrochoidBandFast(n, r, thickness, r_off)".  The motivated student could also probably clean up my train-wreck of code and/or figure out how to do arrays in OpenSCAD.\r
\r
Note also that these rotors can be used for pumps - see the gifs in the comments for an example.""" ;
