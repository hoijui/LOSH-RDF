The channel is designed so that the part can be printed without any internal support material.  This was printed on a Dimension uPrint with zero internal support material.\r\n\r\nThe hollow channel can then be filled with low-melting-temperature metal alloy to form an electromagnet.  \r\n\r\nDue to the low number of turns, the performance of the electromagnet is poor.  This is really just a proof-of-principle of the fabrication method, not much of a practical electromagnet. \r\n\r\nMalone and Lipson report better results using similar materials with a layer-by-layer approach in the paper \"Multi-material Freeform Fabrication of Active Systems\" which can be found here: http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/publications\r\n\r\nThe SpoolHead is another promising approach for making embedded conductors.
