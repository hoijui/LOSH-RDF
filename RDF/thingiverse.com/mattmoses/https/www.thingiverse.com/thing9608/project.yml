function: "This is a follow-on to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:904\r\n\r\nIt is a cylinder with a helical channel.  The channel is designed so that the part can be printed without any internal support material.  This was printed on a Dimension uPrint with zero internal support material.\r\n\r\nThe hollow channel can then be filled with low-melting-temperature metal alloy to form an electromagnet.  \r\n\r\nDue to the low number of turns, the performance of the electromagnet is poor.  This is really just a proof-of-principle of the fabrication method, not much of a practical electromagnet. \r\n\r\nMalone and Lipson report better results using similar materials with a layer-by-layer approach in the paper \"Multi-material Freeform Fabrication of Active Systems\" which can be found here: http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/publications\r\n\r\nThe SpoolHead is another promising approach for making embedded conductors.  Info here: http://reprap.org/wiki/SpoolHead\r\n\r\nUPDATE June 27 2011 - Also be sure to check out Rhys Jones' new results on the RepRap page here: http://blog.reprap.org/2011/06/new-approach-to-printing-metals.html"
