function = "This x-carriage works with a standard wade's or makergear extruder and 8mm smooth rods at the standard spacing.\r\n\r\nI was getting sick of having to tear apart my whole machine or reprint entire axes every time I wanted to upgrade or replace a part, so I've started creating simple modular replacements for the x-axis. In this case, the carriage has brackets to attach a belt clamp, fan mount, pen holder, etc etc.\r\n\r\nNow if you change your x-ends and the belt doesn't line up, just print a new clamp instead of a whole new carriage."
