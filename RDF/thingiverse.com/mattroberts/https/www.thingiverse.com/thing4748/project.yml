function: "While printing the various large z axis components, I was struggling with significant warping.  Stopping the corners of the bits from cooling quickly seems to help a lot (see picture).  So I knocked up a parametric version of the magic corner pieces to help me (and you) with the problem in the future.\r\n\r\ninspired by http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2010/09/some-corners-like-it-hot.html , which may have been inspired by http://technocraticanarchist.blogspot.com/2009/12/printing-big-bits-of-mendel.html\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\nObviously, this licence only applies to apron.scad.
