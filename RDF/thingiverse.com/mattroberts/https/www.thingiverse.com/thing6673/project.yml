function: "Based on http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1524\r\n\r\nI bootstrapped my mendel using a plastruder - which I miss treated and killed.  While it was dying, I edited the mendel extruder block to use as little plastic as possible - here is the result.\r\n\r\nIt has been tested, and it works.  But, it is a pain to set the tension - so if you don't need a minimal extruder block: don't print it.\r\n\r\n(It is much smaller than both Wade's and Adrian's geared extruders as well)"
