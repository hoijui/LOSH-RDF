function = "This is a parametric replacement for the Mendel vertex.  You can easily adjust 13 dimensions (including angle, rod diameter and spacing) and optionally add a levelling foot (created by an captive nut and bolt).\r\n\r\nThe stl files in this thing are all drop in replacements for Mendel vertices, i.e. the (vertical) rod spacing is 58mm, the bars are M8 and the angle 60 degrees."
