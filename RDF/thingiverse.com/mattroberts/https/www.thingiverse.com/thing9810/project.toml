function = "(This is all new code, but it was inspired by whosawhatsis'.  And I have designed it so that you should be able to use this code in place of whosawhatsis' with no issues).\r\n\r\nBasically this is a better parametric teardrop.  I wanted to be able to create teardrop hex nut holes, so I added a parameter for number of sides - which then means that you naturally want a few more parameters as well.\r\n\r\nFile has been updated to version 2, original version can still be downloaded if you wish."
