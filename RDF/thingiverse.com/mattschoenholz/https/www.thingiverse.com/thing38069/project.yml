function: "I realized that the 8mm shaft diameter gear I purchased from Trinity Labs was a little large for the existing version created by piit79 and wanted a couple other modifications including filleted edges and a bit more structural support. In making these changes I pushed out the idler base and therefore had to lengthen the strut.\r\n\r\nI am running dual extruders so the file includes a mirrored version as well."
