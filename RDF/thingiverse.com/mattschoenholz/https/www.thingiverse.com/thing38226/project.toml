function = "As I worked through the assembly of the Kossel ( http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel ), an OpenBeam based Delta style printer, I decided to build it with dual extruders/hotends and wanted to use the M5 PushFit connectors available from Amazon or TriDPrinting ( http://www.tridprinting.com/Hot-Ends/#3D-Printer-Push-Fit-Fitting )\r\n\r\nThis part allows the J-Head to snap into place and fits within and will bolt right on the current effector/platform for the Kossel and Rostock.\r\n\r\nUpdated SCAD file to better fit the inside circle of the Rostock effector. \r\n\r\nUpdate: V2 of SCAD file corrects the misalignment of the single J-head on the insert vs the plate."
