function = "This is a puzzle box. To open it you need to perform a certain gesture and press a button. Here is a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=HTdaDZDc90g  \n\nSomeone who doesn't know how to open it will struggle for a long time, especially if you give them no clues. Once you've learnt the gesture, you can open the box in a couple of seconds.  \n\nThe gesture is defined by the shape of an internal ball bearing maze. This can be easily changed to customise your box.  \n\nMany thanks to London Hackspace, and everyone who has helped me out with learning how to use the laser cutter!"
