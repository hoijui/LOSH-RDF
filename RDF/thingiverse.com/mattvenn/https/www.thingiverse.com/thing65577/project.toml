function = "Want an alternative to fiddly screw terminal blocks? This design allows easy joins between wires with push fit plugs. The plugs are for use between stranded copper wire and solid wire, like leds and phone charger wires.\r\n\r\nThe little holes are for twisting together solid core wires like leds and resistors.\r\n\r\nThe example file is for a moodlamp, but you can use the openscad file to create your own circuits."
