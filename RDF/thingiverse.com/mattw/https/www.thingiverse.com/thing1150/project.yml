function: "Our upstairs neighbor is Aoki Sushi, and I was challenged to make a sake box.  I made this design out of 6mm cherry plywood, and am currently gluing it together.   I'm pretty sure it's not water tight, and Elmers wood glue is not the answer for holding in sake, but who knows, it might work :)\r\n\r\nIf you know of a good food and alcohol safe wood treatment, please leave it in the comments."
