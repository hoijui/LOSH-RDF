function: "Pull the string and watch your Whirligig fly across the room.  Print 2 handles and pass back and forth with a friend.  Tilt at 45 degrees in the direction you want it to fly.\r\n\r\nTo launch, place the whirligig on the handle and wind the string.  Be sure to wind clockwise when viewed from the top of the whirligig/handle.\r\n\r\nAlso comes with a stick so you can launch with your hands, if you prefer that method.  Place the whirligig on the end of the stick and hold the stick between your hands with your hands flat.  Quickly push your right hand forward.  The whirligig will detatch from the stick and fly (you don't want the stick to stay in; the extra weight will cause it to not fly as far).\r\n\r\nStick launched version flies 20 ft (6 m)."
