function = "Cyanoacrylate super glues do not work on PLA.  Epoxies are a hassle, take a long time to set, and not as strong as the rest of your printed part.  Hot air tools melt too much material, make good joints very difficult to acheive, and cannot fill gaps.\r\n\r\nFor a strong, long lasting joint weld pieces together with a soldering iron using this rod as filler material."
