function = "Long slender screwdriver with standard handle.\r\n\r\nI needed a set of small screwdrivers for my bicyle repair toolkit.  I wanted maximium versitility in the smallest space.  Stores sell combo bits and bit drivers, but most have huge handles and won't fit in my toolkit.\r\n\r\n3D printer to the rescue!  I designed a medium sized slender handle and printed it up.  It works great.  The design borrows heavily from this blender tutorial, with some changes and enhancements: http://pages.uoregon.edu/art3d/driver/driver25.html"
