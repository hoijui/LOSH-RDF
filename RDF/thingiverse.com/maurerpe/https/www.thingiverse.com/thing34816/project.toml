function = "Our kids keep losing the tape dispensers, so I decided to make one.  This one fits a standard roll of scotch tape, has printed spring clips that hold the tape securely and printed teeth that cut the tape.  \n\n\n\nPrint it now and be prepared to wrap presents!  \n\n\n\nP.S. We actually found 2 tape dispensers in the time it took me to perfect the design, but it works great."
