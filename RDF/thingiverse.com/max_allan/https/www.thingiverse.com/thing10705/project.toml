I was browsing various other 3D download sites, thinking how bad most of the free models are for 3D printing and found this :\r\nhttp://www.archibase.net/download/27844.html\r\nI thought it could be printable.\r\nSo, downloaded it & imported the .3ds file into Google Sketchup.\r\nRealised that it wasn't perfect, so added a base and a support for the chin. I also decided to add a void in the middle to hopefully use a bit less plastic but still have something to \"fill\" for strength.\r\nThe void has a flat top. My printer did a reasonable job of printing the flat with no support. First layer a bit sketchy, second was fine.\r\nI'm guessing there would be better ways to do the chin support as well but this was a quick job!"
