http://www.archibase.net/download/27844.html\r
I thought it could be printable.\r
So, downloaded it & imported the .3ds file into Google Sketchup.\r
Realised that it wasn't perfect, so added a base and a support for the chin. I also decided to add a void in the middle to hopefully use a bit less plastic but still have something to "fill" for strength.\r
The void has a flat top. My printer did a reasonable job of printing the flat with no support. First layer a bit sketchy, second was fine.\r
I'm guessing there would be better ways to do the chin support as well but this was a quick job!""" ;
