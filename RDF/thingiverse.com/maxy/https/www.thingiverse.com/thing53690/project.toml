function = "This greatly reduces the noise from the extruder motor. The wooden backplane of the Ultimaker did act like a drum.  \n\nTo find out how much noise this upgrade can remove, carefully un-hook the feeder while printing, and hold it in your hand. Answer: it makes a huge difference.  \n\nUpdate1: separate, much better holder for the bowden coupling, and other tweaks.  \nUpdate2: upper hook should withstand PLA creep better."
