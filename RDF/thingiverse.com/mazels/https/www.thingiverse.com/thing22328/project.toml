function = "A toy model of a submarine made by one of my students.\r\n\r\nIn my high school geometry class we used openSCAD and the MakerBot as a way to introduce the z-axis; learn a little code; and review the concepts of intersection, union, and rigid transformations. We spent 2 class periods learning openSCAD and I gave them 2 weeks outside of class to create their object."
