function = "This hobby knife uses X-acto brand No.11 blades (the most common and popular blade size). The knife handle has been modified from a round shape to an octagonal shape like a pencil which makes it easier to hold and also helps prevent the knife from rolling off a table or desk, which always results in the tip of the blade being damaged. Also included is a safety cap/cover."
