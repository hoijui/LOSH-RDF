function = "T-shaped version of Jonas KÃ¼hlings Y Carriage mounting frame for 3 LM8UUs.\r\n\r\nThe drilling holes on the rod with two LM8UU holders *should* match the ones in the mendel/prusa build platform. I can't confirm this for sure as i dont have a prusa.\r\n\r\nUse the scad file to change rod distance and the distance of the two LM8UUs that share a rod.\r\n\r\nThanks to Johnas KÃ¼hling, whose work this is based upon."
