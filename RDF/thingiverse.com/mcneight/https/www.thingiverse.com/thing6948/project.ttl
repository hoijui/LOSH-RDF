Actually, this is something I've been working on for a little while. I just wasn't going to post it until it was really finished. Printing on the powder printer at http://metrixcreatespace.com resulted in an inner diameter that was a hair too small to fit around the Canon 50mm lens I have.  



The important measurement in this flange is the height. Placing this on a lens, your focal length will be 42mm from the bottom of the flange to the imaging surface (42.14mm if you measure to the back of a piece of 35mm camera film).""" ;
