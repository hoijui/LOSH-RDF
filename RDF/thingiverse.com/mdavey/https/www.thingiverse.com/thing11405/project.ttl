    okh:function """This is a knob designed to encase a 1/4" hex head cap screw. Because it can be used with any length cap screw, it's useful in a wide range of applications. The plug covers and secures the screw while making for a nice finished look. Works great as a camera or flash mounting knob.\r
\r
The plug is designed with a lip to snap into the knob and hold the screw in place while it finishes the look of the knob. You will have to print the plug at a reduced size to make it fit correctly into the knob. Because everyone's printer prints slightly different, I have not tried to size the plug exactly. You will need to run the plug at a few XY scales to make the fit perfect. For me running the plug at 96% works great.\r
\r
It is designed for a 1/4-20 screw but could also be used with a 6M screw if printed at approximately 95%. I have not tested this but it should work with a range of screw diameters by changing the print scale to match the screw diameter.""" ;
