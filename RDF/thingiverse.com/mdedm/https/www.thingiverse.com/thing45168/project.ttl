    okh:function """This is a replacement for the connector piece that affixes the metal tube to the snow brush of this specific snow brush: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0B40821331\r
\r
Also known as the Hoppy 54 Inch Pivoting Snowbroom and Squeegee.\r
\r
I uploaded this because there are probably 500,000 of these out there. Given the remarkable construction and durability of this particular snow brush, it would make sense that not a lot of them break. I'm guessing, as an estimate, that a fallout of .2% would leave 1000 people with broken parts on this scraper. Of that 1000, maybe 50 would look for replacement parts (google autofilled "replacement parts" when I was searching for Hoppy snowbrushes.)\r
\r
Of those 50, maybe 1 person has a 3D printer and wants to make a new one. Maybe that one person was me. Maybe there's another person out there who wants to make one, too. (Maybe someone needs me to print this off for them?)\r
\r
So, this part is for you, Mr. or Mrs. Hoppy Brush owner.  3D printing is about being able to make obscure things that almost nobody needs but a few will really appreciate. \r
\r
Enjoy!""" ;
