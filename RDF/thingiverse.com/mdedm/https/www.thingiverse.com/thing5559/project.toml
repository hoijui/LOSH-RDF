function = "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a prototype for a bugbot-type of robot. However, my printer is OOC. Can someone print these files off for me and mail them? I'd need one of box.stl, one of cap.stl, and two each of wheel.stl and bracket.stl.\r\n\r\nI've been looking to buy a thing-o-matic someday when I can afford it, so I'd prefer one made with it. I'd like to have a copy of it, so I'll be glad to pay for materials / time / shipping as long as it's less than $20 USD. Or, I have a CNC router and can trade you for something. I can also send you a box of sawdust if you'd rather have that.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nUpdate: That was quick... I found someone to print this, so stay tuned for the next version. This community is awesome!\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: New files are uploaded that should make things easier to print / use less plastic. Thanks for the feedback so far!\r\n\r\nUpdate 3: I've abandoned this model for a new one that I haven't put online yet. Thanks for the help."
