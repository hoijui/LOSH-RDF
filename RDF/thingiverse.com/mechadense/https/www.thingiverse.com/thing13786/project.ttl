1) [six membered tetrapod ring](https://www.shapeways.com/model/390699/diamondoid-tetrapod-armchair-warped.html)  \r
2) [single tetrapod](http://www.shapeways.com/model/386826/diamondoid-tetrapod.html)  \r
\r
This is a tetra-pod made mainly out of carbon atoms in tetrahedral sp3-hybridization. That means the part has the same symmetry as the atoms it is made of.  \r
The surfaces are passivated (plugged) mainly with Hydrogen (white).  \r
to make the surfaces chemically unreactive.  \r
Some sorts of productive nano-systems like nano-factories will be needed to produce / "print" objects like this.  \r
\r
## Nomenclature  \r
\r
The abbreviation DMSE stands for:   \r
-- Diamondoid Molecular Structural Element  \r
which translates to:   \r
-- very stiff and crystalline -- very small -- non active non moving -- building block  \r
\r
This acronym is rather unsuitable for use in natural language so I'd like to advertise the portmanteau:   "crystolecule"  for building blocks of this kind. It seems fitting since they are small like molecules but their interior has a dense three-dimensional polycyclically meshed and ordered structure like a crystal.  \r
\r
## Details  \r
\r
This structural crystolecule is meant to be used in bigger frameworks like nano-housings etc. The strut ends are unsaturated Surface-Interfaces.  \r
The seven open bonds can be put together in two different ways.  \r
Thus when assembling the tetrapods beside "normal" diamond structure also lonsdaleit structure & many more are possible.  \r
