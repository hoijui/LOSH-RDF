function: "Model on Shapeways:  \r\n1) [six membered tetrapod ring](https://www.shapeways.com/model/390699/diamondoid-tetrapod-armchair-warped.html)  \r\n2) [single tetrapod](http://www.shapeways.com/model/386826/diamondoid-tetrapod.html)  \r\n\r\nThis is a tetra-pod made mainly out of carbon atoms in tetrahedral sp3-hybridization. That means the part has the same symmetry as the atoms it is made of.  \r\nThe surfaces are passivated (plugged) mainly with Hydrogen (white).  \r\nto make the surfaces chemically unreactive.  \r\nSome sorts of productive nano-systems like nano-factories will be needed to produce / \"print\" objects like this.  \r\n\r\n## Nomenclature  \r\n\r\nThe abbreviation DMSE stands for:   \r\n-- Diamondoid Molecular Structural Element  \r\nwhich translates to:   \r\n-- very stiff and crystalline -- very small -- non active non moving -- building block  \r\n\r\nThis acronym is rather unsuitable for use in natural language so I'd like to advertise the portmanteau:   \"crystolecule\"  for building blocks of this kind. It seems fitting since they are small like molecules but their interior has a dense three-dimensional polycyclically meshed and ordered structure like a crystal.  \r\n\r\n## Details  \r\n\r\nThis structural crystolecule is meant to be used in bigger frameworks like nano-housings etc. The strut ends are unsaturated Surface-Interfaces.  \r\nThe seven open bonds can be put together in two different ways.  \r\nThus when assembling the tetrapods beside \"normal\" diamond structure also lonsdaleit structure & many more are possible.  \r\n\r\nYou can find more technical information about   \r\nmechanosynthesis and atomically precise manufacturing in general on my website:  \r\nhttp://apm.bplaced.net/  \r\nor in the book \"Nanosystems\" written by Eric Drexler.  \r\nhttp://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html  \r\n\r\nTitlepicture made with:  \r\nQuteMolX, v.0.5.1, Nanorex, Inc., www.nanorex.com, 2010.  \r\nhttp://qutemol.sourceforge.net/  \r\nStructure generated with:  \r\nNanoEngineer-1, Nanorex, Inc., www.nanorex.com, 2010.  \r\nAnd the paper that presented QuteMol:  \r\nMarco Tarini, Paolo Cignoni, Claudio Montani: Ambient Occlusion and Edge Cueing for Enhancing Real Time Molecular Visualization, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, Volume 12, Issue 5, Pages 1237-1244, 2006, ISSN: 1077-2626  \r\n\r\n## Related  \r\n\r\nSomewhat related to this is one of the simplest possible structurally usable 2D fractals: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14023 .  \r\nExtruded this would form some spongy hexagonal tube structure."
