function: "This is a not so often seen hexagonal fractal.\r\n\r\nThe question was:\r\nWhat is the simplest 2D fractal with hexagonal symmetry under the constraint that it would make a reasonably sturdy structural material when stopping iterations at some point.\r\nThat means the wakest points should scale with iterations too\r\n\r\nactivate line with a=30\xC2\xB0 for sturdy configuration\r\nactivate line with a= 0\xC2\xB0 for weak configuration\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nIf you start asking that same question in 3D instead of 2D you'll get tetrapods out of tetrapods out of tetrapods and so on.\r\nlike this here:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13786"
