function = "fitting to: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15514\r\n\r\nSince the heating chamber was designed to have minimal steel volume and minimal surface area the screws are fairly close together. This complicates the easy and fast attatchment of different input devices (pet band drive / piston)\r\n\r\nThis is an interchangable flange adapter. The rectangular side (warm side) should touch the fiberglass-PCB isolation plates which lead to the heating chamber. On the Flat side (cold side) any conceivable input device can be mounted."
