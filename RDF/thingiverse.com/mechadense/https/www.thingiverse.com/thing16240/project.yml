function: "**Edit 2016-03:**\r\n3D-Maze game models designed to be capped with transpatent acrylic sheets at top and bottom. \r\n\r\nI finally added the source-code with which I generated those mazes.\r\nThis was ~5 years overdue!! Sorry for the \"slight\" delay.\r\nThe code is a rather horrible hack - but I checked and it still works.\r\n(The code is public domain) To use it load the haskell source file in ghci (the interactive haskell interpreter) and type \"help\". To adjust maze size / labyrinthicality / inhomogenity / ... you need to change the source-code since all that stuff is hard-coded.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do elegant idiomatic maze generation in in purely functional programming style (which surprisingly is possible although the problem at first sight seems to require destructive updates) I highly suggest you look at Tikhon Jelvis' work:\r\nhttp://jelv.is/blog/Generating-Mazes-with-Inductive-Graphs/\r\nhttps://github.com/TikhonJelvis/inductive-mazes\r\n\r\nAlso there's a second haskell based maze generator model on thingiverse:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:778556\r\n\r\n**Old text:**\r\nThe big and probably very hard one (20x10x3 paths) is inhomogenous!  \r\nOne side (longest axis) has long pathways with few forks and almost no four five and six-way forks (labyrinthical) the other side has lots of short paths dead ends and more four five and maybe six-way forks (mazeical). There is no sharp border between those regions.  \r\nThe medium sized one (12x12x2 paths) is  \r\noverall more \"labyrinthical\"."
