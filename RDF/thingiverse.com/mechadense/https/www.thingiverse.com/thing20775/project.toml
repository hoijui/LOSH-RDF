function = "Version 2 is here!  \n\n\n\nWith This single quick release coupling one can attach almost anything to the Ultimakers Printhead.   \n\nI'll soon release compatible toolheads for it (2012-04)  \n\n\n\nImprovements (v2):  \n\n* two templates included (raw & cylinder)  \n\n* improved code quality (split in modules) capital lettered modules are meant to be printed or modified by the user  \n\n* male part redesignd for a better print orientation that yields more stability. Still compatible to (v1)!  \n\n* added option to close the slot and mount it by screwing not ziptieing for even more stability  \n\n* slotdepth is now parametric (by taking two measures of your printhead; look for lxy & lxyspace in the malecoupling file)  \n\n\n\nFeatures (v1):  \n\n* generic ... mount any tool you like  \n\n* \"quick\" lock ... change the appandages on the fly  \n\n* ziptie (or threads) only mount & thus non invasive   \n\n    ... the coupling >itself< is removable without disassemblage of the head  \n\n* lightweight & almost no loss of printing space   \n\n    ... the coupling can stay on the printhead all the time   \n\n* does not block the thing:  \n\n    \"Bowden Clamp for Ultimaker (Heater End)\" by owen  \n\n    http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11864  \n\n* one part design ... quick print  \n\n* funny red cross shape fitting to a giant syringe appendage (pasteprinting)"
