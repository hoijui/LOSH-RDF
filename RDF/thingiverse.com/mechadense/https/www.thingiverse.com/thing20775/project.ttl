With This single quick release coupling one can attach almost anything to the Ultimakers Printhead.   

I'll soon release compatible toolheads for it (2012-04)  



Improvements (v2):  

* two templates included (raw & cylinder)  

* improved code quality (split in modules) capital lettered modules are meant to be printed or modified by the user  

* male part redesignd for a better print orientation that yields more stability. Still compatible to (v1)!  

* added option to close the slot and mount it by screwing not ziptieing for even more stability  

* slotdepth is now parametric (by taking two measures of your printhead; look for lxy & lxyspace in the malecoupling file)  



Features (v1):  

* generic ... mount any tool you like  

* "quick" lock ... change the appandages on the fly  

* ziptie (or threads) only mount & thus non invasive   

    ... the coupling >itself< is removable without disassemblage of the head  

* lightweight & almost no loss of printing space   

    ... the coupling can stay on the printhead all the time   

* does not block the thing:  

    "Bowden Clamp for Ultimaker (Heater End)" by owen  

    http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11864  

* one part design ... quick print  

* funny red cross shape fitting to a giant syringe appendage (pasteprinting)""" ;
