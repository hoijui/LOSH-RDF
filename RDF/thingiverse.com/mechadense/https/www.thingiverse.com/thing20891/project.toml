Engraving might work too, but z must be perfectly level and reproducible then.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[1] Some Links to that obscure drill. \r\n(\"MISTER TOOL Elektro-Kombi-Werkzeug\" Mod. s1j-cs1-10)\r\n   that I got from Hofer (Austria)\r\n  \r\nshop:\r\n  http://www.discounter-archiv.de/de/archiv/ALDI-Sued/2003-09-11/Elektro-Kombi-Werkzeug-40-teilig/12147/\r\n  http://www.discounter-archiv.de/de/archiv/ALDI-Sued/2004-09-09/Elektro-Kombi-Werkzeug/15483/\r\n  http://www.discounter-archiv.de/de/archiv/bewertung.php?ID=255060\r\nofficial producer:\r\n  http://www.walter-service.at/\r\nchinese site:\r\n  http://www.keaku.com/products/80059114363.htm\r\nhobby site:\r\n  http://stuff.twoday.net/stories/1694020/"
