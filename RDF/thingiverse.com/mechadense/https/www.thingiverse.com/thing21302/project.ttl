    okh:function """Features:\r
* It can be mounted & removed within seconds facilitating the:\r
    Ultimaker Generic HeadMount\r
    http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20775\r
* No z buildspace is lost. If you crash the syringe into the build platform it will just slide upward until the z endstop is reached - no damage.\r
\r
Restrictions:\r
* springiness of the dyneema thread (preextrusion needed)\r
* If you have a custom extruder you might be required to redesign the winder coupling part.\r
* The current design uses\r
  "Ultimaker BowdenFeeder Repair Kit"\r
  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10799\r
* The current design only works with the old style hobbed bolt which has a hexagonal head\r
\r
Credits:\r
* This design was heavily inspired but not directly derived from\r
  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14421\r
  "ultimaker syringe extruder II" by joris\r
  It was redesigned from scratch to gain more parameterisability\r
  and instead of the plastic filament it uses a dyneema thread to pull the piston in.\r
\r
Notes:\r
* A real bowden-cable from a bike is probably too stiff\r
  the piston wold start to retract before the wire would lie flat on the winder ([4b] see in the instructions)\r
  edit: after initial tests I'am not so sure about this this anymore \r
* The Gcode files are for Ultimakers with an old Bolt.""" ;
