function: "Features:\r\n* It can be mounted & removed within seconds facilitating the:\r\n    Ultimaker Generic HeadMount\r\n    http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20775\r\n* No z buildspace is lost. If you crash the syringe into the build platform it will just slide upward until the z endstop is reached - no damage.\r\n\r\nRestrictions:\r\n* springiness of the dyneema thread (preextrusion needed)\r\n* If you have a custom extruder you might be required to redesign the winder coupling part.\r\n* The current design uses\r\n  \"Ultimaker BowdenFeeder Repair Kit\"\r\n  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10799\r\n* The current design only works with the old style hobbed bolt which has a hexagonal head\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n* This design was heavily inspired but not directly derived from\r\n  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14421\r\n  \"ultimaker syringe extruder II\" by joris\r\n  It was redesigned from scratch to gain more parameterisability\r\n  and instead of the plastic filament it uses a dyneema thread to pull the piston in.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* A real bowden-cable from a bike is probably too stiff\r\n  the piston wold start to retract before the wire would lie flat on the winder ([4b] see in the instructions)\r\n  edit: after initial tests I'am not so sure about this this anymore \r\n* The Gcode files are for Ultimakers with an old Bolt."
