function = "Version 2 is here! \r\n(see at the end of the description)\r\n\r\nThis is more or less a copy of the \"Mini-shredder/Mini-filetador\" from Takashi Utsumi\r\n\r\nIt is designed for wider blades:\r\nWidth: 18mm  -  Thickness: 0.5mm\r\nThe cutting edge length: 100mm \r\n(the whole paralellogram is longer)\r\n\r\nLinks to the original:\r\nhttp://www.utsumi.com.br/pet/English/filetador/index.html\r\nhttp://www.utsumi.com.br/pet/English/dicas/minifiletadores_como_fazer.html\r\nhttp://www.utsumi.com.br/pet/English/\r\n\r\nPossible uses:\r\n1) Weaving -- Make cool woven objects like those described on Utsumis pages.\r\n2) Directly feed it into a hot end (to be designed) for printing (The melting point of bottle-PET is below 260Â°C edit: I sucessfully printed with 250Â°C)\r\n       http://blog.reprap.org/2009/03/drink-bottle-feedstock.html\r\n3) Feed it into into a re-extruder to make 3mm filament for bowden printers.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing with version 1 it is clear that PLA is definitely not suitable - the friction heat cuts right through the plastic after just a few 10m of ribbon. ABS might work but I think an incorporated L-Alu-Profie will be better.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nVersion 2 is aviable !\r\nThis one uses an Alu-L-Profile for feasable wear resistance.\r\nYou'll either need an aluminum-L-profile of the following dimensions or change the *.scad parameters.\r\nwidth = 25mm; height = 15mm; (length = 135mm)\r\nTo make the production of the alu part easier a drilling & sawing template part is included."
