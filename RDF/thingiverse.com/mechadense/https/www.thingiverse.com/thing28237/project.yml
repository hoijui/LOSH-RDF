function: "**Note: Use of this code is DEPRECATED**  \r\n\r\nGenerating this progressing cavity pump thing that is presented here can  \r\nnow be done with just a few lines of code by using the new library:  \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:777936  \r\nhttps://github.com/lsuess/scad-lib-cyclogearprofiles  \r\n\r\nHere is a similar (followup next version) progressing cavity pump thing where that new library is used.\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:867401  \r\n\r\n----  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:  \r\n\r\nThis is the center part of a progressing-cavity-pump (PCP-pump or moineau-pump)  \r\n\r\nIt implements the design approach with alternating epi- and hypocycloids which avoids cusps/kinks (the curve is C1 but not C2 continous)  \r\n\r\nRight now it uses two and threefold symmetry for rotor and stator respectively, but it shouldn't be hard to change it to any N and (N+1) symmetry (it's prepared) like three and four for more sturdiness or one and two for more throughput.  \r\n\r\nIt is a positive displacement pump and thus provides (if the clearance would be zero) constant flow with arbitrary pressure. At no time the input and output section is directly connected. It is suitable to pump high viscous liquids possibly mixed with solid particles. You can find more info on wikipedia.  \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTES:  \r\n\r\nMajor tweaking points are marked with arrows.  \r\n\r\nCurrently wall thicknesses are faked by scaling correctly for the radial component and rotating incorrectly (by eye) for tangential component. An offset in the epi and hypocycloid functions would be better.   \r\n\r\nFor the initial print I used a very high clearance of 0.6mm to make sure it will fit.  \r\n\r\nIf your printer is tuned well I recommend to reduce it a lot and make a new stator *.stl.  \r\n\r\nsidenote:  \r\n\r\nThere are also conical PCPs which by nature cant be completely tight if made out of noncompliable material.  \r\n\r\nMOTIVATION:  \r\n\r\nI am thinking about a steel printed version for re extrusion of PLA and PET plastics. Judging from the PLA melt artworks PLA should flow in by gravity. Sadly I had no success trying to \"gravity melt\" PET in a steel-can at 230\xC3\x82\xC2\xB0 in 15min. Melting it with an soldering iron at that temperature works like a charm ... why the difference?   \r\n\r\nFor now this is a huge one just for fun and maybe for (off printhead?) paste extrusion.  \r\n\r\nSOURCES:  \r\n\r\nhttp://siag.project.ifi.uio.no/problems/gravesen/  \r\nhttp://www2.mat.dtu.dk/people/J.Gravesen/MoineauPump/"
