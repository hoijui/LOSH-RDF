function: "This is a mechanism to transmit rotation power between two axles that can move relative to one another but stay parallel at all times. It can take higher loads than a doublecardan joint.  \r\n\r\nI need to ad a clearance parameter for the pins. The first test-print was stuck.  \r\n**Generally this design needs a lot of improvement. Expect problems.**\r\n\r\n**Known issues:**  \r\n\u2605 short pins are too stiff  \r\n\u2605 tolerances are too thigh  \r\n\u2605 parts are too thick  \r\n\r\nit was inspired by this:  \r\n  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14060\r\n\r\nand it is intended as a drive for my moineau pump model  \r\n  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28237\r\n\r\nFor the connector pieces the optimal length is chosen automatically."
