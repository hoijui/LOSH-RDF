function: "This is a roller bearing that can be printed in one piece.  \r\n\r\n**edit:** needs improvement; see below.  \r\n\r\nThe special thing about it:  \r\nIt has less sliding friction than a roller bearing *with* cage.  \r\nThis is archived through the central rolls.  \r\nThose let the inner and outer rolls roll on rolls.  \r\nThis bearing can can take radial and axial force.   \r\n\r\nIt should run under (axial) load so that rolling is ensured !  \r\nA preload would work to but than a zero clearnce print with post assembly is required.  \r\n(split the ring or better the center piece in two for that)  \r\n\r\nA little bit of unavoidable friction occurs at the slanted top & bottom retainers but this should'nt hurt.  \r\n(gears also have a tiny friction component)  \r\n\r\nIt was inspired by this thing:  \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:55515  \r\nWhich in turn was inspired by emmets popular gear bearing.  \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451  \r\n\r\n**This needs improvement !**  \r\nMy test-print fused together on the outer edge so hard that I broke the ring when I tried to break the outer rollers loose. At the same time the inner rollers where so loose that they almost slid out. Also the small diameter rollers didn't turn out round enough to roll - even under load."
