function = "Fitting weather vane:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42049\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis thing is fully parameterizable and meant to be customized before printing.\r\nIt is optimized for support-less printing (blades are oriented vertically)\r\nand designed out of two parts so that even on small build-space printers pretty big propellers can be made. The appended *.stl file is only an example. Customize the model to get the biggest propeller you can print (almost twice the diagonal of your build-platform length).\r\n\r\nOne could print a lot of them as toy propellers in different colors all with different random parameters in reasonable margins and mount them on a kind of \"wind sculpture\".\r\n\r\n### Ideas for improvement:\r\nRight now its just a toy but one could:\r\n* add grooves for ball bearings\r\n* twist the blades\r\n* generalize to 3 or more blades (4 non-coplanar should be easy)\r\n* alter the blade shapes to something less classic but more fancy e.g. modify the blade to a more aerodynamic shape (NACA4)\r\n* make the blade-angle adjustable\r\n* make a coupling for a dynamo\r\n\r\n### Going crazy:\r\n* add  button-cell powered laser-pointers to get a free laser-show at squally new moon nights\r\n* mount (suitable!) whistles to the tips (so your child wont be overheard when cycling), but don't forget the (slide-able?) muting plugs then."
