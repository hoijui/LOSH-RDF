It makes it hard for amusement.\r\nServe your victim a drink and have fun.\r\n\r\nIt was inspired by a jar with\r\nthe german dialectic inscription \"SAUF WONNST KONNST\" \r\nwhich translates well to the choosen title.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI couldnt find the correct english name of this thing, only a huge lot of german synonyms:\r\n(vexierkrug, vexiergefÃ¤ÃŸ, lochkrug, halbekrug, scherzkrug, gaudikrug)\r\nIf someone knows the correct english term, please comment.\r\nAll my guesses (puzzling jar, TRY jar, ..) where obviously wrong.\r\nBtw.: if you know the open secret, please dont spoil it in the comments."
