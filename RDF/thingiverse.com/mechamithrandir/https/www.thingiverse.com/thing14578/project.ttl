I named the parts myself in what made sense for me and does not reflect the same naming scheme Makerbot Industry uses.\r
The parts have not been partitioned so that they can be printed out on a cupcake CNC or Thing-o-Matic. I don't have plans currently to do so but I may do so if there is a high demand for it. \r
\r
I used the original .DXF files from Makerbot to make these. They're posted at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4973\r
\r
Specific parts such as nuts and bolts have not yet been included.""" ;
