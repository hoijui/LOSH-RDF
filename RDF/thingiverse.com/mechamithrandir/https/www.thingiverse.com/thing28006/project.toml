function = "A seej cannon I designed to launch pennies in volleys of either one, two, three or stacks. It didn't work as well as I hoped for a stack of pennies but works wonders in launching nerf darts. Features include trigger, variable power (easily attach additional rubber bands for mroe power) and angle adjustment."
