function: "Over the summer I plan on making a load bearing leg support. It features a variety of functions from acting as a support structure, load bearing assistance, attaching holsters, attaching leg and shin guards, etc. \r\nFor now, I started with the shoe portion to test out if it can support me (approx. 160 lbs)\r\nMost of the measurements are approximations where the holes should be treated as pilot holes for threading in M16 bolts and the hex gaps should be enough to fit both the head of the bolt and the hex nuts depending on where you position them\r\nThis is a very basic design and its up to you to modify it to your needs, Theres enough space to add a few batteries, drill some holes into the plastic and add LED's. If it is good enough to support a person's weight, I hope to one day attach wheels to make it a roller skate and eventually one day maybe replace going to the shoe store and just printing out a custom shoe. The extrusion on the heel is to allow for the attachment of linear actuators for assisted walking."
