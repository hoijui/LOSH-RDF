function = "5 Degree of Freedom Arm\r\n\r\nThis project is intended on being an educational project so kids can learn about robotics. Originally I intended on having it controlled by servos and a microcontroller but realized that may have been a bit complex for the age group I was designing it for. After this project, I may expand on it to aim it at a more advanced group."
