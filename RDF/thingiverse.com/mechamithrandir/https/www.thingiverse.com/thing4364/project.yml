function: At Makerbot we have some tape guns that come with a hollow handle. So one day, Steven gets the great idea of putting exacto blades in the handle so he can tape and cut open boxes when needed. But he needs something to keep the blades in. After about 30 minutes of designing and printing, he got just what he needed.
