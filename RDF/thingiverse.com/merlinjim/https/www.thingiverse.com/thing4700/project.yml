function: "This is a modification of the MakerScanner v0.3 scanner for the BDL220S Black & Decker Laser Line Level with Wall Mount.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blackanddecker.com/power-tools/BDL220S.aspx\r\n\r\nIt\\'s designed to use the wall mount\\'s existing magnetic rotational bearing.  I chose this as it was one of the cheapest laser line levels at my local hardware store (this is carried at Lowe\\'s and Ace Hardware as far as I could tell online) Because of the integration of the wall mount, you get a very solid, very smoothly rotating scanner.\r\n\r\nThe BDL220S base unit is removeable for transport and use as intended.  If you\\'d like to still be able to use the wall mount, Black and Decker sells extra base units from their parts replacement center:  http://www.blackanddeckerservicenet.com/Products/PartDetails.aspx?partid=242704"
