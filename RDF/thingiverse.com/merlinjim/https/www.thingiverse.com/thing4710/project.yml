function: "This is a calibration comb test for your makerbot.  Make sure you're laying down nice parallel and evenly spaced lines.  Rotate 90 degrees to test both x and y axes.  Use the included .scad file to create calibration tests large enough for your entire platform if you're a real stickler for precision!\r\n\r\nThis is also meant to be a base for an ooze test... I'm hoping some enterprising individual will want to add the test to the end of each line.  The extra commands needed are to stop the extruder, and move the bot at the feedrate (not travel feedrate) to the edge of the comb area - the end of the top-most string with the y coordinate modified for each line.  If you do, please post as derivative object."
