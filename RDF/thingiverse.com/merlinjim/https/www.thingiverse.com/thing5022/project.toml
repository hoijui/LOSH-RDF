function = "These are printed tealight holders with a seperate piece to cast a shadow on the wall.  Do not use PLA!  Both ABS and PLA are flammable, use at your own risk!  I designed it with air holes for a metal tea-light candle, this should be safe and keep high temperatures away from your plastic - just make sure to use with the kind of tea light that's poured into a metal cup!\r\n\r\nThere's some amount of variability in tea lights.  I designed these for 1.5\" diameter lights, if your tea lights vary, you can use the included openscad file to customize.\r\n\r\nI've printed 8 of these already, with more on the way.  I plan to set them in a box at work with a sign \"Free - take one, Merry XMas!\"  If you want to tweak the shape of the tea light holder for less plastic, lower profile, or quicker printing - I included the .scad file I used.  It should be possible to reduce the printed volume by about half and still have it be 100% functional... there's some variability in commercial tea lights, this was designed for tea lights with a slightly undersized 1.5\" metal cup - you can customize for your own tea lights with the .scad, as well.\r\n\r\nI've burned several tea lights all the way down in these with no ill effects yet - the plastic did not seem melted or deformed in anyway directly under the candle cup afterwards."
