function = "This is for clipping your HBP cables to the platform to prevent the wires from shifting and shorting.  I had an error where my bot would stop a few layers into a print.  While the layer was always random, the hot end was in roughly the same position each time - I finally (with some help from the makerbot google group) figured out it might be the HBP cables shorting when its in that particular position.\r\n\r\nI kind of mashed up my idea with the self-leveling HBP idea someone else posted about a month ago...\r\n\r\nI haven't mounted the HBP and printed with it yet after making this modification - so YMMV.  I anticipate there might be issues with it smacking into the bot housing at the Y- / Y+ extreme."
