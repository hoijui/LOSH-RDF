    okh:function """This is for clipping your HBP cables to the platform to prevent the wires from shifting and shorting.  I had an error where my bot would stop a few layers into a print.  While the layer was always random, the hot end was in roughly the same position each time - I finally (with some help from the makerbot google group) figured out it might be the HBP cables shorting when its in that particular position.\r
\r
I kind of mashed up my idea with the self-leveling HBP idea someone else posted about a month ago...\r
\r
I haven't mounted the HBP and printed with it yet after making this modification - so YMMV.  I anticipate there might be issues with it smacking into the bot housing at the Y- / Y+ extreme.""" ;
