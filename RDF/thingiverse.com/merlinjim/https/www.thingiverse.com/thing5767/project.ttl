    okh:function """UC4 is an enterprise automation package.  We're hosting a UC4 user conference at work later this year, and I have a reputation around work as a patissier, so I wanted to make some UC4 rolled cookies (aka sugar cookies)\r
\r
I just noticed - the cookie cutter as printed looks backwards (it should be a mirror-image when upside down, of course)\r
\r
I think this might be a thingiverse bug, however - I don't recall having any issues the first time I printed this thing up, it was a few months ago however...\r
\r
You can check out UC4 and their great product at http://www.uc4.com/\r
\r
If you happen to work for UC4, you should give my company a discount for all the free publicity I throw at you guys.  Contact me privately if you'd like to take me up on that...""" ;
