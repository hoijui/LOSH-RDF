    okh:function """A Unicorn-compatible mount for the same laser pointer as in the LAZOR mount thing.\r
\r
The LAZOR mount is technically an ancestor of this design, as I used that base as a starting point when designing this.\r
\r
Includes a mount for a micro servo and a flag to block the laser beam.  This should be compatible with the unicorn firmware & hookup.  I haven't assembled yet, but I think the pen down angle will be 60 and the pen up angle will be 0.\r
\r
Only printable on a MENDEL!!!!  The base is 14+ cm wide!  Also, it'll print much better with the smaller features on a stepstruder!\r
\r
UPDATE: we test mounted this at my local makerbot club's meeting this Monday.  The mounting holes are a little too close for the makerbot z-stage, we ended up using some tape to do the test.  Will change and update in the near future, in the meantime I can confirm this works!\r
\r
Smoking's bad for you.  And bad for your makerbot.  But it sure did help me get the laser aimed here:\r
