function: "I'm really excited about Barton Dring's Buildlog.net Laser 2.x design, but I need the available cutting area to be just a bit bigger. What parts need to change to get a larger (or smaller) cutting envelope? These parts.  \n\nGiven the x-y-z dimensions of your desired cutting envelope, this OpenSCAD script calculates the length of all the MakerSlide and other aluminum extrusions for the motion system and frame, as well as belt, drive shaft and leadscrew lengths. It also renders new skin panels to fit the scaled frame.  \n\nA dimensioned part list will appear in the OpenSCAD console window. Copy this to a text editor, clean it up, and use it in conjunction with the standard Laser 2.0 BOM at Buildlog.net to work up your part orders for a custom-sized machine.  \n\n(Copy hint - ctrl-C might not work. You may need to right click in the OpenSCAD console frame and use the pop-up menu to do \"Select All\" and \"Copy\".)  \n\nThe skin panels can also be rendered in a higher-resolution 2D layout, for DXF export. (Press F6 for CGAL render, then \"Design\" menu, \"Export as DXF\".)  \n\n###UPDATES  \n\nOctober 2012 : Made the Misumi order based on the output of this script, assembled the frame, and everything went together as expected.  \n\nI've also had one other report of a good frame built from dimensions generated by this script.  \n\nOctober 2013 : Finally finished the build and started cutting. It works!"
