function: "I was asked for a series of Dinosaur inspired spikes that would be able to house a line of bright LED's and could have variable shapes and sizes.  So here they are!  \nThese spikes can be added to any shirt or jacket to transform yourself into a freaking dinosaur,  more specifically a Stegosaurus, or even a Godzilla!  \nPrint them from clear PLA and add LEDs with the base plate.  A laser cuttable version was on hackaday: http://imakethin.gs/blog/glowy-dinosaur-hoody"
