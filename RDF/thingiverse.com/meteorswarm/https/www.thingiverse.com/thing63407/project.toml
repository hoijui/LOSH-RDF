I'm taking measurements of my mouthpieces with calipers.\r\n\r\nI don't really like how long the cup is relative to the back pipe; I don't think the parameters work particularly well for tuba mouthpieces, but we'll see.\r\n\r\nUpdate: turns out that the cup depth is the inner depth, and I measured the outer depth. I'm going to get some modelling clay to see if I can take a mold of the inside, then I should be able to directly measure the cup depth and the throat diameter.\r\n\r\nCustomized version of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44422\r\n\r\nCreated with Customizer! http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=44422"
