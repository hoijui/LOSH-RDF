The newer generation of Lincoln Log-cabin builders have it soft.  In my day, the cabins were made of round logs, and were drafty, and we liked it!  We didn't have these new-fangled, flat-bottomed logs that are all-together too easy to stack.  We only had a few of the specialized, flat-bottomed foundation logs, and did we complain? (much?)\r
