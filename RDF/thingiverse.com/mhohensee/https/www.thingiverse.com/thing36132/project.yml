function: "Old-fashioned Lincoln Logs, for when you just need one more piece, or when your dog ate part of that old set.  Dimensions match those of a set dating back to the eighties, at least.\r\n\r\nThe newer generation of Lincoln Log-cabin builders have it soft.  In my day, the cabins were made of round logs, and were drafty, and we liked it!  We didn't have these new-fangled, flat-bottomed logs that are all-together too easy to stack.  We only had a few of the specialized, flat-bottomed foundation logs, and did we complain? (much?)\r\n\r\nKids today, I tell ya.\r\n\r\nNow with roof support!"
