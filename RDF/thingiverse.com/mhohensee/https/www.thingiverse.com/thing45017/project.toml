function = "UPDATE: The spokes are now customizer-compatible!  Go nuts! \r\nUPDATE TO UPDATE: And now the flatnessFactor actually works in the customizer.  Go walnuts!\r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, I used to play with a construction set that consisted of straws and a bunch of round vertex-pieces with a varying number of spokes that the straws could be stuck onto.  I passed many a happy hour as a young nerdling building all sorts of meshes and lattices out of them.  Now I've got my own kids, and along comes a similar, although vastly inferior version that only allows straws to be linked in a cubic lattice.  Thanks to 3D printing, my kids need suffer to be square no more!"
