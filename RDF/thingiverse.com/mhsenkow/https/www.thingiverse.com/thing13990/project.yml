function: "I guess you can only have one ancestor? Experimenting with combining the glasses concept with the living hinge, so that you can produce a wooden object with built in joints, as one solid object. \r\n\r\nI printed off one but our laser cutter is small so it was smaller than intended andt he hinges were rather fragile.
