function = "My wife is a violinist and wanted me to try to print her one.  I downloaded the stl files from http://forums.luxology.com/topic.aspx?f=4&t=61185\r\nit was pretty big so I will not repost.  I kept all the parts to scale as large as I could without going over the volume of the Replicator.  The violin next to it is a 1/16th violin for comparison. A couple of the parts require harder materials than abs, so I won't use the ones I printed like the tail and the bridge.  Also I may replace the finger board.  The owner of the music store I went to get the parts from suggest in the future I use horse hide glue which has a low shear strength but a high contact strength so that it can be taken apart if needed.  Needless to say he was pretty excited about the possibilities!"
