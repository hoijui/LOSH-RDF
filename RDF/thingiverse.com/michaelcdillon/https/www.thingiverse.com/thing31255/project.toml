function = "I have a MakerGear Prusa Mende, and they included a PTFE filament guide tube. Its fantastic at keeping the filament from catching on anything as it is routed to my extruder; however I wanted to clean it up and provide a permanent point so that my spindel feeds into the tube flawlessly.\r\n\r\nMy guide tube is ~4mm in diameter, the guide holder front (the long column extension) has an inner diameter of 4.25mm."
