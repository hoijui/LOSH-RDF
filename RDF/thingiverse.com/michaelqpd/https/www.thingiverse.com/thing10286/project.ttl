\r
I took a piece of track off Dav : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8805 and the lego piece from Wizard23 : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:591 and merged the two together.  Thanks to them for their fine work.\r
\r
I've not tested this item yet as my printer is under construction still. The only problem yet I can see is that Dav was having issues with the track so updates may follow.""" ;
