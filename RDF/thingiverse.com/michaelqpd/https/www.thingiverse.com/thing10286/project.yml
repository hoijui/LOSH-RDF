function: "This is a Brio Wooden Train Track adaptor to allow kids to make items out of lego and add a piece of track to it.  This will help with making bridges etc.\r\n\r\nI took a piece of track off Dav : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8805 and the lego piece from Wizard23 : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:591 and merged the two together.  Thanks to them for their fine work.\r\n\r\nI've not tested this item yet as my printer is under construction still. The only problem yet I can see is that Dav was having issues with the track so updates may follow."
