function = "My own version of what a spool holder should look like. It's a simple block with one hole and one indent. The holder is constructed using 3 m8 (or smooth) rods and 4 blocks. The whole sits on top of your prusa with 2 blocks and 2 other clocks are used to lay the spool on. The spool turns around one of the bars. \r\n\r\nIn this design I used 2 ~28cm m8 rods and one ~18cm smooth rod I had around. The minimum recommended amount of nuts is 4. \r\n\r\n-UPDATE: For small (up to r=10cm) spools I've made this much better holder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45588 . It uses only one piece of rod and no tools needed!"
