function = "It's a spool holder for Prusa mendels. It looks a bit like a tipi so that's why I named it that. Two of these baby's in combination with a piece of 8mm rod will hold spools up to a radius of 10cm. The feet will 'snap' onto the top of your Prusa and the rod should pop in snugly so this is a complete toolless design!"
