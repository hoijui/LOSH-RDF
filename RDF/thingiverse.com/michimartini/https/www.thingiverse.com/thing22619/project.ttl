Actually, this is custom made to fit my Bontrager mountain bike with a 31mmx35mm tube. The idea is that it snaps right on without any cable wraps and can be easily snapped off again when not needed.\r
\r
I don't have a printer at my disposal right now, so i just sawed and carved the parts from Delrin(TM) and they just happened to work perfectly. I reduced the bed part to just a thinnish slice though, which seems to be enough. The phone stuck firmly to the handlebar even over rough terrain.""" ;
