function = "A derivative of MakeALot and chylld's previous work. \r\nI wanted a more tweakable model, and decided to switch to a different coordinate system as my brain doesn't bend around toroids as easily as MakeALot's!\r\nIt's classed as a toy because I spend more time finding cool settings than I do compiling and printing variants (which is quite a claim if you increase the number of spheres and decrease the $fa parameter too far!)\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n2011-06-21 Update\r\nI've also implemented the algorithm in Art of Illusion, as it allows much higher resolution STLs to be generated for much lower computational cost."
