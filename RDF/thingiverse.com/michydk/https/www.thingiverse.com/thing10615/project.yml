function: "This extruder is based on \"RepRap Universal Mini Extruder by adrian-bowyer\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLabitrude 1.0 Beta 2 -> Labitrude 1.0 Beta 3 Changes:\r\nAir vent in fixed block and base is changed.\r\nDriven gear changed\r\nVersion numbers on some parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main differences is that the Labitrude extruder is based on materials that we (*)\"The reprap group @ Labitat\", already have on our shelves.\r\nThis means that it is designed for:\r\n1. 3mm filament\r\n2. Nema17 motors \r\n3. \"608\" barrings.\r\n4. The need for glueing the duct is removed, but both fan clips must be glued on.\r\n5. The air duct is changed, and partly integrated in the fixed block.\r\n6. 6. 3mm studding used to get at secure grip at the drive, and easy to disassemble again.\r\n7. gear ratio changed to 30/11 (needs verified testing)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need 1.75 mm filament, or if the compact design is important, you really should consider the original \"Reprap Mini Extruder by adrian-bowyer: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7975\r\n\r\n(*) Labitat is a Danish hackerspace in the heart of Copenhagen - Further information about Labitat can be found at http://www.labitat.dk"
