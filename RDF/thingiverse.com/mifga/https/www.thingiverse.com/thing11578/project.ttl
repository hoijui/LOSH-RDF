\r
Thankfully, Andrew Plumb built an OpenScad project for the brace and the hinged mounting point that makes these possible.\r
\r
So now it is time for you to create your own 2D designs to be used to make Raceway Targets of your own! Please share your own images or sets! Or your flat items that you would like attached to a hinge and run over!""" ;
