function = "Back during World Maker Faire 2011 I transformed Nick Normal's 3D scan into a series of flattened models. I meant this to be a gift for him for setting MakerBot up with such a great booth location at the event, but then never saw him to hand him to himself. Also, the children kept taking the models as soon as we printed them. \r\n\r\nTo create these sort of models, you can isolate a scale transform to the Y axis only -- creating a model more like a cameo. You could easily make a cameo of Flattened Nick Normal, come to think of it. Great next project."
