function: 'I recently took Skimbal''s Thor''s Hammer to MegaCon in Orlando, Florida, as a tribute to Stan Lee (who was in attendance). I wanted to make a smaller version that could be printed quickly for giveaways, and this is what I came up with. Note that I put both parts on the plate at the same time such that I could print a plate of silver and a plate of brown and then swap heads. My explanation -- the silver handle one is the "space version." They are rather cute, so no one minded that much. Next up: dualstrusion version of the same files!'
