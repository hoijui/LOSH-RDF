\r
I, for one, believe there should be more "robot" things in the MakerBot community. Why don't you scan and trace your favorite robots (both of fiction and fact) and share them back with us here?\r
\r
While these images are for the MakerBot Unicorn Pen Plotter, feel free to adapt them to the Frostruder or other pen plotter tools. I included all of the source files I used so you can make your own versions. There are also better images out there -- I encourage you all to out do me here and post your version!\r
\r
These are more images requested and prepped for MakerFaire NYC 2010. Behind the Star Wars characters and a few enthusiastic pushes for Keepon, Wall-E and Roomba were the second most frequently requested. For this release I updated my assets with the new dxf conversion I used to create the better speedier prints of R2-D2 and C-3PO also here on Thingiverse.com.""" ;
