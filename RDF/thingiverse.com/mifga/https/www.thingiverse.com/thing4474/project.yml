function: "I have been very curious about the Custom-Cookie-Cutter-Generator (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3433) created by guru and decided to jump on that tool, up the nodes to 50 points from 20points, and then make some Halloween themed cookie cutters! \r\n\r\nI made a bunch of ravens, but v05 and v02 seem to have worked best! (v05 has fewer bits at risk of burning or snapping off for actually baking cookies, btw)"
