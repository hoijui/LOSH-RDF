function: "I have been curious about the Custom-Cookie-Cutter-Generator (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3433) created by Guru and decided to jump on that tool, up the nodes to 50 points from 20points, and then make some Halloween themed cookie cutters! \r\n\r\nI worked on a slew of versions of iconic Hitchcock profile silhouette both drawn (Unicorn) and, but this hand-drawn attempt works best for both communicating the profile and making good cookies. \r\n\r\nNOTE: the cookie cutter slicing part (the part on view in the image) cuts a mirror image of itself, so the cookie would flip the Master of Suspense back around to his more iconic orientation."
