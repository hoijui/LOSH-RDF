function: "This is a version of merlinjim's Rose for Unicorn Pen Plotter that uses a hatching pattern to fill in the weighted lines. This drawing works well with a fine-nibbed art pen like a Pigma Micron 3 or 1.\r\n\r\nBonus points to someone willing to go back to the original and work out a multi-pass version using delicate touches with a brush pen to re-create the this work to match the original illustration (with a variation in line weights), or create a tool for ranges of line weights!\r\n\r\nYou will definitely be wanting schmarty's Inkscape Unicorn extensions for this piece. And my calibration test image might help you troubleshoot the settings in schmarty's tool (and tensions for your belts in your bot).\r\nAnd you should also grab the Eggbot Inkscape extensions to get a copy of dnewman's Inkscape hatch fill extension to use for solving fill issues like this one quickly and elegantly"
