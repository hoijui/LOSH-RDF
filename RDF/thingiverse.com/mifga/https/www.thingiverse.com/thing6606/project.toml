function = "Keepon (and co-creator Marek Michalowski) visited the BotCave other day. A number of the MakerBot staff are big fans of Keepon so we started an internal challenge to create hats that can be printed with Marek's new Thing-O-Matic for Keepon. Here is my cluster of work-in-progress fedoras. Please feel free to make improved derivatives of my STLs in progress or wait for me to tune this up. \r\n\r\n\"My Keepon\" is a $40 \"toy\" version of Marek and Hideki Kozima's Keepon robot. You can learn more about it here: beatbots.net/2011/01/31/my-keepon-from-wow-stuff/"
