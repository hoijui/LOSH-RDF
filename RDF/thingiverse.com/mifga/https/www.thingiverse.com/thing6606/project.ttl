A number of the MakerBot staff are big fans of Keepon so we started an internal challenge to create hats that can be printed with Marek's new Thing-O-Matic for Keepon. Here is my cluster of work-in-progress fedoras. Please feel free to make improved derivatives of my STLs in progress or wait for me to tune this up. \r

"My Keepon" is a $40 "toy" version of Marek and Hideki Kozima's Keepon robot. You can learn more about it here: beatbots.net/2011/01/31/my-keepon-from-wow-stuff/""" ;
