function: "This set of short GCode scripts initiates what I hope will be a longstanding practice of creating fun things for your bot to do. Nothing as heavy as extruding much. More dances, gestures, sounds, and neat tricks. \r\n\r\nThese scripts play well on all MakerBots (I don't play favorites: Thing-O-Matics and Cupcakes are both invited to the party). \r\n\r\nMake sure to read the instructions at the top of the code before running each partymode. Your axes might be reversed in a different pattern than mine -- so watch out!\r\n\r\nWhere are your partymode scripts? And quick utilities? And stupid pranks? Making these things is probably the best way out there to get a firm grasp on essential, human-readable g-code scripting.\r\n\r\nThey always told me that the future would be fun. And so I made it fun for everyone.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this set:\r\n\r\n\"Game Anthem Grrarr!\"\r\n\"MakerBot M Stamper!\"\r\n\"one turn deserves another\"\r\n\"Party like a cube\"\r\n\"sNAKEy dANCe\"\r\n\"Stirring the Air\"\r\n\"Triangle Man, Triangle Man\"\r\n\"Where Is Violin! Is Too So Small!\"\r\n\r\nThanks to Pleasant 3D for the great gcode path visualization ... for these behaviors that leave no extrusion trace upon the world. (http://bit.ly/dUe5xh)"
