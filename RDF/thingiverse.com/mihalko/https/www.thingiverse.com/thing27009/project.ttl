    okh:function """I`m planning to order another toy for me - Raspberry Pi. Since I like little bit another design I`ve found here on Thingiverse, I redesigned great RP case made by RichRap.\r
\r
Featuring:\r
- redesing\r
- case now has stands! :)\r
- removed mounting ears\r
- GPIO/non GPIO version\r
- completly new light guides. Dimensions of these guides are based on RichRap`s version.\r
\r
V2 EDIT:\r
Thanks to profbraino tips, version 2 comes to place. \r
- Model is scaled now (1.02) so it is not so tight. \r
- one board stand is moved, it should not interfere with board anymore (please confirm)\r
- case was interfering with plastic under the usb connector. Problem solved.\r
- gpio opening is 3 mm wider\r
\r
I like idea to cover whole SD card, it just does not look nice right now. It is too big compared to rest of case. I have to figure out design for this feature.\r
\r
WARNING!\r
I haven`t printed this case yet, because I do not have RP. Dimensions SHOULD be right, but it is not confirmed yet! That`s why is this thing marked as work in progress. If you will print it, please give me some feedback. Thank you.""" ;
