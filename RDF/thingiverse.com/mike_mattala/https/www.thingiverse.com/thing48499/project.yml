function: "I was looking for an S Hook and was impressed with the original parameterised design.  Unfortunately, I needed an S Hook that had a greater distance between the two hook ends.  This design includes a length parameter which will automatically extend the S Hook if needed.\r\n\r\n###PS: You can help support my designs by downloading and liking here: https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/105681-simple-s-hook###"
