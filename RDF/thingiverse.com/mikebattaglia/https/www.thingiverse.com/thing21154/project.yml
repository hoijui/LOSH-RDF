function: "I designed this pencil holder in Rhino 3d.  \r\n\r\nNow, you may be thinking.. \"but I can only fit 5 or 6 pens and pencils in there.\"  Well, this is true but I realized that no matter how many pencils and pens I have on my desk, I always grab the same 1 or 2 over and over.  I don't want to live a life of excess, do you!?"
