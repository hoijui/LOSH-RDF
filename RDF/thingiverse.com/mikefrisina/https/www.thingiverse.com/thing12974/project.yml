function: "This is another filament spool holder and my first upload to Thingiverse. I wanted to create something that would be useful on my Makerbot and something that someone else can use as well. With the new extruder head and the possibility of using multiple colors, I wanted a spool holder that would allow me to place more then one spool on the top of my machine. I actually got the idea from the \"The Awesome is Free\" by Allan Ecker. \r\n\r\nUpdate: I developed this part using a software package that I use for my product machine shop. It is OneCNC XR4-Mill 3D.\r\n\r\nSince this is my first post, any suggestions or comments that would help with future designs or postings are welcome."
