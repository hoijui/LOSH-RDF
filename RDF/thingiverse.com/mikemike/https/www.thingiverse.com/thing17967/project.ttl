    okh:function """Work in Progress... This is a modification (more like a hack) of DuexVis' Techzone Huxley LM6UU X-Carriage.  And version 2 and up takes the slim bearing holder from simonkuehling http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16208.  Thank you both for sharing and including all of the required OpenSCAD files.  DeuxVis did the hard work for me by designing the object and figuring out the placement of the bearing holders.  I just changed a few dimensions to suit my needs.  And thanks to simonkuehling for the slim holders.\r
\r
I needed a larger hole so I could drop my hot end down through the hole instead of pushing it up into the snug hole.  I'm using a j-head nozzle Mark IVb from Hotends.com that is held by the original TechZone clamp.  No other support is needed.  So, I don't even need the 2 holes used to hold the peek block.\r
\r
update: I printed and installed this on my Huxley.  I posted more pictures.\r
\r
Also printed PLA bushings (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16464).  Soon, I'll update to these modified to 6mm (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16813).  I'm still shopping for reasonably priced 1/4" bearings.  And I'm hesitating on switching my printer to 6 mm smooth rods and bearings.""" ;
