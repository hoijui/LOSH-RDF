function = "Wireshelving brackets always fall apart.  Keep your shelving together with these brackets.  \r\n\r\nCurrent stl stats:  each bracket is 25mm tall with 4.9mm spacing for shelves.  the spacing dimension, height, and solidity of the print is critical to the strength of your shelving unit.  There is a small amount of trade-off between height and solidity. \r\n\r\nDrooping overhangs on the second cylinder level tend to increase tension when these brackets are put into use, but it would be nice to design them out by modifying just a few z layers to spiral out.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe openscad file will be at http://github.com/miloh/scad_stl.  \r\nUse the openscad file to change the spacing variable if you prefer more tension, or change the height to make super grippy 30mm tall brackets."
