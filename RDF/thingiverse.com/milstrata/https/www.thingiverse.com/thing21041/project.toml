function = "A small holder for 10 CR2032 coin cell batteries.\r\n\r\nUpdate 12/22/2017: Added Fusion 360 export with some user parameters to adjust for different sizes and number of coin cells.\r\n\r\nThe original version (the one without a lid) fits a bit tight when putting batteries in, so I've added a second version with a lid that should allow the batteries to be inserted and removed easier. Also, the lid has a clip to keep the batteries in place if it tips over.\r\nOriginal and first lid versions were made with Tinkercad: https://tinkercad.com/things/loEv8YSIHRY"
