So we quickly created a 3D model from the phone, printed it out and added picture of start screen.\r\n\r\nThe phone feels awesome and we are waiting to get real one in hands!\r\n\r\nIf you are also waiting for new Lumia 920, print it out with our miniFactory 3D printer and try how it feels. Sadly, the electronics are not included in print :)"
