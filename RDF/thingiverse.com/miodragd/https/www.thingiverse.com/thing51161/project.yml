function: The medallion was made in year 2003 and is designed as an ornament for the Christmas tree. Was carried out in 20,000 copies and sent Croatian embassies around the world. He served as a remembrance of a donation in the "Let's help children affected for the mine fields in Croatia." I hope you still adorned Christmas trees are the people who donated money to the charity.
