function = "Just use a regular nema17 motor and Bob's your uncle.   \n\n\n\nTwo things have been changed from regular Greg's, one is the motor location, that has been translated, and the whole thing has been elevated over the base so elements protruding to the back (towards the x-carriage) are now above it.  \n\nThose of you using Budas hotend may want to use the new version with 10mm spacer included so it won't bump into the x-carriage.  \n\n\n\nIt fits the standard x-carriage of Prusa i3 (30 mm version, which is the latest).  \n\n\n\nBased on dviejo's mod."
