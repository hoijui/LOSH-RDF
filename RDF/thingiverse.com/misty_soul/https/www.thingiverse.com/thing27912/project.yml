function: "A small holder for round rechargeable batteries (AA, AAA ...).\r\n\r\nThe openscad file is parametric, you can change diameters, height, number of rows and columns, walls thickness, size of the push-through hole, presence of the rectangular frame or not.... There are no specific parameters for the slope of the top side, but it is easy to change by looking into the scad file.\r\n\r\nNote the diameter for the AAA batteries is a tight fit, you may want to increase it slightly. There are holes at the bottom of the cells, so you can use something to push the batteries through if they are to tightly held.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the file has been simplified and the half rows at bottom and top have been reduced, so the pictures do not represent exactly the last version. The rectangular frame can be ignored by setting the with-frame parameter to false.\r\n\r\nThe very short honeycomb module can surely be reused elsewhere."
