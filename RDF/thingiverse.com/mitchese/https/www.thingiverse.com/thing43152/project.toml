function = "This is a modified version of the bind reducing X end from kludgineer, which accepts the Thomson Leadscrew from Trinity Labs.  Intended for 10mm bushings on the Z axis, and 8mm rods on the X axis.\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at modifying a design, any problems please let me know.  I will post the idler STL once I have tested it to ensure it works.  Download the motor end and the idler end, and print off two copies of the clamp."
