function: "This is a project that my seventh grade soft circuits students worked on. It was inspired by Scott Peterman's The Imaginary Marching Band http://www.imaginarymarchingband.com.\r\nIt uses Mark Demers from Spikenzielabs's Serial-MIDI Converter http://spikenzielabs.com/SpikenzieLabs/Serial_MIDI.html, GarageBand and Arduino.\r\n\r\nTheir idea was to create conductive materials in the form of their heads. The first iteration used the Kinect with Kyle McDonald's KinectToSTL (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/Makerbot/tree/master/KinectToStl). The second iteration used Autodesk's 123D catch. After we printed the heads we created silicone mold using The Complete Sculptor's Resilpom 2 (www.SCULPT.com). The students experimented with jello with added salt, conductive dough, water and ice."
