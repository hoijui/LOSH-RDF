    okh:function """These are based off of the popular KÃ¼hling's X ends (18384) but have been modified to work with RichRap's quick-fit x carriage (19590) as well as mine (37675).  These should fit any x carriage, if not let me know what needs to be corrected and I will fix it.\r
\r
The only issue I had with KÃ¼hling's X Ends was that I would not be able to use them for my X Carriage due to the belt clamps being 7.2mm further off of the axis.  Instead of shifting the weight of the stepper motor 7.2mm further off to the side, I decided to place it behind the Z Rod to help center it's weight.""" ;
