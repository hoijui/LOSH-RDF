function = "A T-slot mount for the MendelMax that allows the voltage converter to be mounted to a T-slot under the bed surface.\r\n\r\nHole measurements the same as Ultibot's design.\r\n\r\nThe initial version had M4 holes instead of M5 holes.\r\n\r\nThe version 3 STL files shoul work for M5-10 screws, while the V2.1 ones is suitable for M5-12 screws.\r\n\r\nV2 changes:\r\nMoved M3 holes further from extrusion. It also fixed the M5 hole sizes and added space for a washer.\r\n\r\nV3 changes:\r\nWidened extrusion mount to allow M5 screws to be installed after the converter.\r\nIncreased thickness of extrusion-side part - V2 was too thin for mounting with M5-10 screws."
