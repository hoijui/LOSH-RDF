function: "The original didn't work with the servos I had on hand, and I wanted to be able to add more articulation and improve bits without having to start over from scratch. Thus: the Modular Hexapod.\r\n\r\nThe dovetail tongue and groove design was inspired by the Simple Spool System for Makerbot http://www.thingiverse.com/derivative:5005 I wanted to be able to switch out parts as I improve them and to avoid absolute positioning. \r\n\r\nVideo of my first configuration in action: http://www.flickr.com/photos/moleofproduction/5318014248/\r\n\r\nMore videos w/ creepiness cranked up to 11:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/moleofproduction/5331316152/  \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/moleofproduction/5330707869/  \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/moleofproduction/5331321724/\r\n\r\nI used the nifty Pololu Micro Maestro x6 servo controller and 4 AAA batteries to get things moving.\r\n\r\nSkull attachment adapted from: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4378 printed w/ MakerGear .25 nozzle."
