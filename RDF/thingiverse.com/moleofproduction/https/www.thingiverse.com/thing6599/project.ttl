    okh:function """Rosettes for M3 nuts that make spring-loaded leveling easier. A lot easier. I even reach in and give them a quick tweak while the first layer is printing.\r
\r
\r
I made these a few months ago and forgot to post them. Aside from the rosettes, my leveling method is darn close to haqnmaq's recent Thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6558\r
\r
The rosettes are useful anywhere, of course, but I made them specifically for leveling the build platform on my cupcake.\r
\r
\r
The gist:\r
\r
â€¢ Three screws instead of four (with four screws one nut always seems to end up loose)\r
\r
â€¢ Conical springs (I kept bottoming out on one side. Conical springs can collapse almost flat) and M3 thin nuts to keep the platform from getting too tall.\r
\r
â€¢ Flathead screws to avoid collisions with the extruder nozzle.\r
\r
\r
I ordered my conical springs from McMaster. They're very nice, just the right size, and strong....but $14.73!? For three springs?!?! Later I realized that I was surrounded by conical compression springs: anything that takes AA batteries will have a double set of them just the right size, so raid your junk drawer.""" ;
