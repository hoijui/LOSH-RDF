function: "Rosettes for M3 nuts that make spring-loaded leveling easier. A lot easier. I even reach in and give them a quick tweak while the first layer is printing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI made these a few months ago and forgot to post them. Aside from the rosettes, my leveling method is darn close to haqnmaq's recent Thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6558\r\n\r\nThe rosettes are useful anywhere, of course, but I made them specifically for leveling the build platform on my cupcake.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gist:\r\n\r\n\xE2\u20AC\xA2 Three screws instead of four (with four screws one nut always seems to end up loose)\r\n\r\n\xE2\u20AC\xA2 Conical springs (I kept bottoming out on one side. Conical springs can collapse almost flat) and M3 thin nuts to keep the platform from getting too tall.\r\n\r\n\xE2\u20AC\xA2 Flathead screws to avoid collisions with the extruder nozzle.\r\n\r\n\r\nI ordered my conical springs from McMaster. They're very nice, just the right size, and strong....but $14.73!? For three springs?!?! Later I realized that I was surrounded by conical compression springs: anything that takes AA batteries will have a double set of them just the right size, so raid your junk drawer."
