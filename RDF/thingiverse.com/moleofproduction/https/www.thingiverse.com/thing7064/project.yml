function: "I wanted a proper board to mount the MAX6675 sensor discussed here: http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Hacks_to_the_RepRap_Extruder_Controller_v2.2\r\n\r\nDatasheet is here: http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX6675.pdf\r\n\r\nI haven't attempted to use it yet, but it etched cleanly and I had no trouble getting the chip to seat on the pads. There are pads to mount a .1uF capacitor as well, but damn those things are tiny and exactly the same dingy-beige as my carpet. \r\n\r\nI'm better with CAD than I am with Eagle, so I welcome a proper Eagle version if anyone wants to put in the time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I'll be under my desk with a flashlight and a magnet hunting for capacitors.\r\nDamnitallsomuch."
