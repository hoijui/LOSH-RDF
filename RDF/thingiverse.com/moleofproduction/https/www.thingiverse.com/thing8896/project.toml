I used SketchUp to make them a couple mm thicker.\r\n\r\n(also, \"octopus\" is Greek, not Latin, so you would either pluralize it as an English word, \"octopuses,\" or a Greek word, \"octopodes,\" pronounced \"ahk-TOP-oh-dees.\" Not that it at all matters in the slightest.)\r\n\r\nLove love LOVE the original."
