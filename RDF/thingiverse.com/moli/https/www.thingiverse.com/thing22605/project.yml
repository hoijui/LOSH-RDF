function: "It's good to have a replacement pacifier, or an extra, for a doll. At least my daughter thinks so. I believe the one I uploaded here may be scaled to fit most dolls. Possibly only the tip needs scaling to fit the mouth of your child's doll.\r\n\r\nGenerally, keep the pacifier away from children that put things in their mouth! The plastic may break into swallowable-sized parts. (Thanks for the comment by CidVilas!)"
