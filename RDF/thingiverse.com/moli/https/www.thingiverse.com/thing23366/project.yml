function: "If you use the type of cheese slicer that was invented in Norway in 1925 by Thor Bj\xC3\xB8rklund, according to Wikipedia, then maybe you too put it with the cheese in the fridge. \r\n\r\nI was bothered by it getting dirty and getting everything else in the fridge cheesy. So I made this simple sheath to cover it. The slicer fixes itself easlily in the sheath by its elasticity, and since the sheath is open at both ends, it cleans well in the dish washer."
