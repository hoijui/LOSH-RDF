\r
I never found a spool idler fitting my 2.3 kg spools from ReprapWorld, and I was never certain that I would get those spools again. So, I mocked up this design where the 608-guides in one side are confined while the 608-guides on the other side may slide freely on the axles in a wide range.\r
\r
The frame is not too nice, and warps easily for me. I will probably make a new design which should print faster, warp less (rounded corners), and use less material. However, for now this one works very fine.\r

(Note: OTED, One Touch Exchange of Die, came out of development towards just-in-time production control at Toyota by a really smart guy, Shigeo Shingo. If interested in flexible manufacturing go for his book "A Study of the Toyota Production System",  ISBN 0-915299-17-8. Or just get some interesting information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTED)""" ;
