    okh:function """This linear bearing has four tubes that are filled with a number of bbs.  The bearing has a cap that is held on with two screws.\r
\r
I have now included the 6mm and 8mm versions of the bearing\r
\r
External mounting is performed with zip ties passed around the decorative ribs on the bearing.\r
\r
I designed this as a replacement for the Lm8uu 8mm linear bearing.\r
\r
These bearings are louder than a standard bearing.  It is important to note that using steel with copper is not the best solution.  Steel shot are a better solution, but not as easy as bbs to get ahold of.  besides........\r
\r
These bearings only cost 35 cents to make.  Including the copper bbs.""" ;
