function: "This linear bearing has four tubes that are filled with a number of bbs.  The bearing has a cap that is held on with two screws.\r\n\r\nI have now included the 6mm and 8mm versions of the bearing\r\n\r\nExternal mounting is performed with zip ties passed around the decorative ribs on the bearing.\r\n\r\nI designed this as a replacement for the Lm8uu 8mm linear bearing.\r\n\r\nThese bearings are louder than a standard bearing.  It is important to note that using steel with copper is not the best solution.  Steel shot are a better solution, but not as easy as bbs to get ahold of.  besides........\r\n\r\nThese bearings only cost 35 cents to make.  Including the copper bbs."
