\r
This linear bearing has four tubes that are filled with a number of bbs. The bearing has a cap that is held on with two screws.\r
 \r
I have now included the 1/4", the 6mm, and the 8mm versions of the bearing\r
 \r
External mounting is performed with zip ties passed around the decorative ribs on the bearing.\r
 \r
I designed this as a replacement for the linear bearings used within the reprap and maker community.\r
 \r
These bearings are louder than a standard bearing. It is important to note that using steel with copper is not the best solution. Steel shot are a better solution, but not as easy as bbs to get ahold of. besides........\r
 \r
These bearings only cost 35 cents to make. Including the copper bbs.""" ;
