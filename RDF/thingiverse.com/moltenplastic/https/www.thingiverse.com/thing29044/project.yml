function: "Build your own bearing!!!  Bring your own bbs!\r\n\r\nThis linear bearing has four tubes that are filled with a number of bbs. The bearing has a cap that is held on with two screws.\r\n \r\nI have now included the 1/4\", the 6mm, and the 8mm versions of the bearing\r\n \r\nExternal mounting is performed with zip ties passed around the decorative ribs on the bearing.\r\n \r\nI designed this as a replacement for the linear bearings used within the reprap and maker community.\r\n \r\nThese bearings are louder than a standard bearing. It is important to note that using steel with copper is not the best solution. Steel shot are a better solution, but not as easy as bbs to get ahold of. besides........\r\n \r\nThese bearings only cost 35 cents to make. Including the copper bbs."
