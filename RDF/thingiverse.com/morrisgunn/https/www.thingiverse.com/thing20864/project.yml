function: "This is a Widening of the original PrintrBot base that I had an idea for since I am building a larger than stock Printrbot. It is designed to hold 12mm Z rods and LME12UU bearings from VXB. I have stylized the parts I edited to be a bit more edgy. I will be stylizing and uploading the rest of the pieces as I replace them on my machine (which is not complete yet.)\r\n\r\nthe X axis will have slightly less travel to make room for the 12mm hardware, and the Z rods will sit a little bit deeper in the base slightly reducing the Z travel per rod size.\r\n\r\nI have not yet printed these, if anyone has feedback I would love to hear it. \r\n\r\nThank You Brook Drumm for giving us the PrintrBot! http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16990\r\nhttp://www.printrbot.com\r\n\r\nOh, this is my first THING!\r\n\r\nReady to rock! I will print these this weekend or as soon as I get my Printrbot working.\r\n\r\nBase with 8mm Z rod uploaded, make sure you get the right one.\r\nWill upload source files at a later time."
