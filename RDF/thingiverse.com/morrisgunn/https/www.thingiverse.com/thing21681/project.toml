function = "This is a high efficiency replacement shell casing for toy foam dart launchers that use them. \r\nThey are sized to fit most standard size darts. The base has a wider air port for modded guns, as well as a shelf that prevents the dart from sliding out the back. The central tube fits snuggly to the dart the whole length without taper, so it fires smoother than the original casings.\r\nTwo versions provided, single, and 100x100mm layout with 20 shells."
