function = "This is a shell that fits some foam dart launchers, It holds 8 6mm plastic BBs like the ones used for airsoft guns. The 80x file will print 80 of the buggers on a 200x200mm print surface. May want to try one first.\r\n\r\nIt will not be very powerfull unless you have a modified launcher. Do not point at people. I take no responsibility for use or misuse of this design. Try not to kill each other out there."
