function: 'This is a R2 dome that I have been working on for a while. It is designed for our students in the robotics program at Idaho State University. The download is in Autocad 2013 format. It has all of the parts to make it functionable. It is designed for HS-81 and HS-322HD servo foot prints. I have printed it and am working on the controls right now. For more info on the complete project please visit ISU Robotics at: https://sites.google.com/a/isu.edu/rcet-projects/'
