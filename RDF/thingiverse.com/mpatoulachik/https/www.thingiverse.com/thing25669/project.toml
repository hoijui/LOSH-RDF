The wall thickness is 1mm.  \r\n\r\n**-Edit-**\r\nI just noticed I had the wrong file (Without base, kind of missing the point...).  \r\nBoth are available now.  \r\n\r\n**-Edit 2-**\r\nAdded higher res files as the polygons are visible on the print\r\n\r\nAs in \"Open source\" I try to share my source files, so there is the Solidworks 2012 file as well.\r\n\r\n**-Edit 3-**\r\nI made a new variant with integrated support for the underside of the loop.\r\nFiles are here:\r\nhttps://www.youmagine.com/designs/klein-bottle-for-easy-printing"
