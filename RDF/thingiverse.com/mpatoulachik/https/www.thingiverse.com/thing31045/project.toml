function = "These are simple printable mounts to fit 40mm fans on the X,Y and E steppers of the Ultimaker.\r\n\r\nI noticed my steppers became hot during long prints, so I found a bunch of 40mm fans to help the steppers keep a bit cooler. I guess being really warm reduces their lifetime.\r\n\r\nI do not have any heatsinks, but I guess this will still help a lot."
