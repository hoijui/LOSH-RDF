    okh:function """This thing will enable you to clean thoroughly the filter of your Neato robot vacuum cleaner.\r
Since you still need to use the regular vacuum every now and then (Neato doesn't cleans behind furniture or on shelves), you use it to suck all the dirt that gathers into the filter. It is a "reverse flow" cleaning of the filter which is very efficient.\r
\r
Since a Neato filter costs almost more that 10 regular filter bags, you want to take care of it !!!\r
Tapping the filter as they say in the manual will kill it quickly (plus it makes a cloud of dust...).\r
\r
Might work for Vorwerk Kobold V100; they seem to be identical to Neato's XV15 and XV25\r
\r
This one is for vacuum pipe of 32mm diameter (electrolux).""" ;
