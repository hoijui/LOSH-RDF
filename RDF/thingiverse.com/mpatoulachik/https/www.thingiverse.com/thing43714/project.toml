function = "My IBM Thinkcentre has only one 3,5\" bay,CD and floppy, and I wanted to add a SSD hard drive while keeping the old disk as storage.  \nThe computer is a special small form factor and the floppy drive has also a strange form factor.  \nIt is a Sony MPF820 and its dimensions are L130 x W96 x T12,7mm  \nThis thing is an adapter to install a thin 2,5\" SSD in this [strange dimension} floppy bay (1,44MB heh, who needs that?)"
