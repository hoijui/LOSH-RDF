function = "I wanted to print the Eiffel Tower model large. Starting with the 4-part files (from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32825 ), all but the bottom piece could print at 350% on my Replicator 2. To print the bottom part I had to cut it in half using Blender ( http://www.blender.org/ ).\r\n\r\nAt 350% even the railing prints at a .1 mm layer height. RepG kept crashing right at the end of slicing the bottom halves so I ended up using MiracleGrue for those pieces."
