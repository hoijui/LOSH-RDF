function: "**RO** bot **SCO** ut - Small (relatively) Arduino Powered rover featuring 1-piece Printed ABS treads.  \n\n***MAJOR UPDATE***  \nNew Thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:145577  \nNew Design Utilizes Android 3.0+ Device for Camera/Wi-Fi Remote control (Telepresence)  \n\nMore Details at http://www.Arxterra.com  \n\nDesign intended to incorporate DC motors (propulsion), servos (for look up/down), and stepper motor (for look left/right), IR sensors (distance ranging), laser pointer (for coolness), shaft encoders (for speed detection/DC motor syncing), gyroscope (for automated missions), XBee control (for guided missions), and a mini-video camera (for coolness).  \n\nI designed this as part of a school project, replacing a purchased metal chassis/kit with a fully 3D printed (as much as possible) body kit.  \n\nSuggestions for Improvement Welcome."
