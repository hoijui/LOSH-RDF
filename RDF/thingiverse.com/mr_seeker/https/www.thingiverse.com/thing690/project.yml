function: "If you are blind and want to know what the size is of the coin you are holding in your hand, this is one way to do it. You slide the coin from the bottom to the top until it stops. If you feel at the side, it will tell you the value of the coin. Works with US coins ($0.01 to $1.00).\r\n\r\nThis is only a rough draft. Its just a prototype to show what can be done with 3d modelling, its not designed for the field."
