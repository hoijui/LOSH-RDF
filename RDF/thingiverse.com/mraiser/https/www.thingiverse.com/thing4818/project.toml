function = "Toaster simple autonomous vehicular design (by autonomous I mean \"goes forward all by itself\" not \"navigates its surroundings all by itself\"). You will need a DC motor a 9 volt battery and a 9 volt battery connector. Your motor probably won't snap into the motor holder unless it happens to be the PARSIMONIOUS & PETITE MOTOR from American Science & Surplus, but the design should be easy to modify to fit whatever you've got lying around (Yes, I know it's a 6 volt motor hardwired to a 9 volt battery-- trust me it won't blow up)."
