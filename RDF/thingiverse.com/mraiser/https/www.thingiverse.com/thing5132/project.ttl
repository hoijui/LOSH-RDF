    okh:function "This is a derivative of Jaylan's C&LFS, in that I looked at it long and hard before designing my own from scratch. ;-)  It's cheaper because it requires no nuts, bolts or other non-printable parts other than marbles. It's lazier because only the two files with the word \"spindle\" in the name were actually designed for this thing. The other parts came from other designs I'm working on and they fit a little loose because I was too lazy to adjust them for this design. I substituted a little krazy glue for the missing elbow grease and it seems to work fine." ;
