First off, the list of things this is a derivative of:  

- My original tank design http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6554  

- Tracks Chain and Pinions by foxdewayne http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5690  

- Chain and Pinions by aubenc http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5656  

- Large Threaded Bolt and Nut by ub3rgeek http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4880  

- Parameterized battery pack with contacts by obijuan http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5079  

- Parameterized Battery Compartment by guru http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5051  

- My original 9 Volt Racer http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4818  



The circuit board may have been updated since the version on thingiverse http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7618. Download the latest version from github https://github.com/NBitWonder/DCMotorController.  



The parts are individually laid out in layer 2 of tank.blend. The tank.stl is really just for the pretty render and is not useful for printing.  



UPDATE: The motors I chose for this project ended up not having enough torque to drive the treads. The motors ended up getting used for the successor to the Tank line-- the Truckbot line: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10349""" ;
