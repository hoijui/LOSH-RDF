function: "Printable snap-together tank with electronics. This design is a collaboration between my company http://newbound.com and NBitWonder.  \n\n\n\nFirst off, the list of things this is a derivative of:  \n\n- My original tank design http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6554  \n\n- Tracks Chain and Pinions by foxdewayne http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5690  \n\n- Chain and Pinions by aubenc http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5656  \n\n- Large Threaded Bolt and Nut by ub3rgeek http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4880  \n\n- Parameterized battery pack with contacts by obijuan http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5079  \n\n- Parameterized Battery Compartment by guru http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5051  \n\n- My original 9 Volt Racer http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4818  \n\n\n\nThe circuit board may have been updated since the version on thingiverse http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7618. Download the latest version from github https://github.com/NBitWonder/DCMotorController.  \n\n\n\nThe parts are individually laid out in layer 2 of tank.blend. The tank.stl is really just for the pretty render and is not useful for printing.  \n\n\n\nUPDATE: The motors I chose for this project ended up not having enough torque to drive the treads. The motors ended up getting used for the successor to the Tank line-- the Truckbot line: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10349"
