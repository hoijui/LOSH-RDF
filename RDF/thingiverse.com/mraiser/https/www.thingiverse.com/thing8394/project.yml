function: "Well, it could be a four way flow control valve if you don't need an \"off\" position. Or if you can find a servo with 300 degree action it can have six positions. The photo is shown with only one tube, but you will need a tube for each input you want to control. The inner disk rotates, pinching all but one input at a time.\r\n\r\nThis thing was inspired in part by this guy's video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h9cLpLw_9E&feature=player_embedded.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Video of this thing in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBHl2WdncW0"
