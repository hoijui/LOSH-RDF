function = "Replacement wheel for a child's toy stroller. Suitable for axles that end with a rivet head.\r\n\r\nSo, after my first attempt (thing:16040) the cheap plastic stroller died. fortunately we were able to find an almost identical one with metal pipe construction.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a wheel was broken. Even more unfortunately the new wheel had been riveted onto the axle so the axle ended in a dome.\r\n\r\nTo get around this I redesigned the wheel with a two part collar that fits around the axle, the wheel force fits around that and holds it together. It worked perfectly in the first print. The photo is the wheel after a few months of use."
