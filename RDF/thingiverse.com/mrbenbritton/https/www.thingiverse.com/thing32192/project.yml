function: "This is a replacement wheel for a toy cart.\r\n\r\nA cart at our local Playcentre (parents co-op early childhood education place) was broken. One of the wheels had worn through. I whipped up a design for a replacement in an hour and printed the replacement.\r\n\r\nThe replacement looks good (the colour was my daughter's request)and works well. Now I'll see if it can handle the punishment a class of pre-schoolers can throw at it.\r\n\r\nIt was the longest print I have done so far (4 hours and change). It took about 6 attempts to get a decent print and I learned a lot about shepaherding a thing-o-matic through a long job. I have a few things to tweak on my bot before I do another job this long."
