    okh:function """I am making these to 3D print them for my wedding in July. Each guest will receive their own word, similar to an intention. I wanted to show how a 3D printer is different from a mold in that each one can be unique.  It was initially made with Tinkercad but I have since derived it to be made with openSCAD.   

In the zip file is everything to run OpenSCAD and make your own by changing the word variable.  In addition, I have included all 190 or so STLs. that I made while determining the best parameters for inputting, rendering, and exporting and are my back-ups if I can't figure out how to make a batch file..  

Limitations:  
If someone knows how to create a batch file using the words in the text file, that would be amazing.  I also haven't figured out how to get openscad to run via command line and successfully output an stl.  

Enjoy.  and Peace!""" ;
