function: "This bearing is a test piece for a home project. I want to build a working Stirling engine, and I need to get the friction down.\r\n\r\nThe bearing uses 12, 4mm diameter, steel ball bearings which I got from my local cycle shop. Assembly is very , er... fiddly, but it is possible with a bit of patience."
