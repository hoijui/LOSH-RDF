function: "This is a spring loaded clip to hold a dial gauge firmly in place when levelling the platform on a Thing-o-matic with a mk 6+ stepstruder.\r\n\r\nThe gauge bolts to the clip.\r\n\r\nThe width of the clip, as printed, is 75 mm, so it has to be squeezed to clip into the 70 mm gap that the heated nozzle fits in. The compression keeps the clip secure. This was printed at 50 % infill, it may be that less dense infills will give less spring tension.\r\n\r\nI would recommend using this with the power off, to avoid damage."
