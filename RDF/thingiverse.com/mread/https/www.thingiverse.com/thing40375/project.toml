function = "This is a 12v LED spotlight which is used to supplement the led strip lighting above my desk.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the led strip light under the shelving provides a pleasant ambient light, I occasionally need a brighter lamp for reading or taking measurements. I do realise it would have been a lot cheaper and less time consuming to go out and buy a lamp, but, where is the fun in that!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note use only 12V ( or lower ) LEDs.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12V Halogen bulbs will generate significant amounts of heat and are not suitable.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************************************************  \r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances use this with mains voltage  \r\n\r\n***************************************************"
