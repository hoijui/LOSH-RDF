function: "Simple press fit Raspberry Pi case. The one in the photographs was printed using \"clear\" PLA and then changed to blue PLA once the top/bottom was finished and the walls started.\r\n\r\n123D design files included if you want to modify it.\r\n\r\nIt has just occured to me that if I had put the raspberry pi logo on the inside of the lid and added a bright LED inside the case, the logo would appear as a silhouette on a glowing plastic face. I might have to try that.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I had to look up how to spell silhouette  :)"
