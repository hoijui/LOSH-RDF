####### Version 4 #######  

May 2013  

This version uses ABS conductive filament from Rainbot3D.com, which greatly simplifies the top and bottom electrostatic combs.  

The combs are completely printed, so no messing about bending and shaping wires. This also makes the parts much more reproducible and consistent.  

The plastic has a resistivity of about 100 Ohm-cm. As printed, with 10% infill, I was measuring around 150 Kohms for each comb. As we are dealing with very small currents this is acceptable.  

The bottom comb is in two parts, which acts as a clamp for the earth wire.  

The top comb has a "shelf" such that the tin foil wrapped sphere rests on it to provide the electrical contact.  

I had hoped to print the sphere with the conductive filament but I think the resistivity was too high.  

The only wire needed now is the earth wire, I usually hold this while shocking myself.  

Holder for battery pack added to the base.  

All parts printed on my Rep2 in PLA, except the combs which were printed on my thing-o-matic mk6.""" ;
