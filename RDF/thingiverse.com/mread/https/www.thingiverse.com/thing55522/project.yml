function: "A small Van De Graff generator, probably best not used in your pockets, and probably best not to run it near delicate electrical equipment.  \n\n####### Version 4 #######  \n\nMay 2013  \n\nThis version uses ABS conductive filament from Rainbot3D.com, which greatly simplifies the top and bottom electrostatic combs.  \n\nThe combs are completely printed, so no messing about bending and shaping wires. This also makes the parts much more reproducible and consistent.  \n\nThe plastic has a resistivity of about 100 Ohm-cm. As printed, with 10% infill, I was measuring around 150 Kohms for each comb. As we are dealing with very small currents this is acceptable.  \n\nThe bottom comb is in two parts, which acts as a clamp for the earth wire.  \n\nThe top comb has a \"shelf\" such that the tin foil wrapped sphere rests on it to provide the electrical contact.  \n\nI had hoped to print the sphere with the conductive filament but I think the resistivity was too high.  \n\nThe only wire needed now is the earth wire, I usually hold this while shocking myself.  \n\nHolder for battery pack added to the base.  \n\nAll parts printed on my Rep2 in PLA, except the combs which were printed on my thing-o-matic mk6."
