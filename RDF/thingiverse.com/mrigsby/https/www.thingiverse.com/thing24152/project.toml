function = "Tyree is a smiling, tail wagging, sensorless 3d printed robot.  Tyree (he wears a tie and has tires . . .) uses an Arduino motor shield to detect current in the motors. When he strikes an object, it is more difficult to turn the wheel (more current), and that triggers evasive action (so--in a way, there are no external sensors)."
