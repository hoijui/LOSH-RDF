function = "After having some minor problems getting circles right and trying to get 608 bearings into my printed parts, I created this simple test to verify I had round holes.\r\n\r\nAn American nickel is 21.21mm in diameter, and 1.95mm in thickness. Ref(http://www.usmint.gov/faqs/circulating_coins/?action=faq_circulating_coin)\r\n\r\nThis test has an internal diameter of 22.0mm (what's 0.69mm between friends?) and a height of 1.95mm. \r\n\r\nThis test will also be a good and quick test of the \"Bottom\" setting, and a good way to ensure the \"Fill\" settings are making solid top layers.\r\n\r\nCheck out my interwebs!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/geodroidjohn\r\nTwitter- @mrjohnecker\r\n\r\nBuy some 3D Printers-\r\nGearbest- https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits-c_11399/?lkid=13099383"
