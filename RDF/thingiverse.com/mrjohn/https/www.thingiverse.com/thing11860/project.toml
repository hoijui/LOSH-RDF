function = "VISOR 1- DON'T USE. The front bars were too small and broke easily. Small head area. Support material was difficult to remove since it was at an x angle.\r\n\r\nVISOR 2- Improved the bars and made them slots. Still give a 1:1 view ratio. Widened the visor. Turned on to the Y axis so you can include \"Support material\" at the x. (Makes it easier to remove support)\r\n\r\nVISOR 3- Same improvements as v2 also included a closer fit to forehead and cheek bones. Beveled out the temple rests.\r\n\r\nFrom http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/treknology/treknology-v.htm\r\n\r\n\"VISOR Acronym for Visual Instrument and Sensory Organ Replacement, a device Lt. Cmdr. Geordi La Forge used until 2373 to overcome his blindness. The VISOR was not only sensitive to the visible spectrum, but to a wide range of electromagnetic radiation. By 2373, the VISOR has been replaced by bionic eye implants (TNG).\r\nIn the real world the basic functionality of Geordi's VISOR will possibly be achieved within the next decades, provided that our understanding of seeing (which takes place in the brain as well as within the eyes) is improved. Suited sensors will be available very soon. However, subspace physics will most probably not be involved. The subspace technobabble obviously serves to emphasize that the VISOR is a 24th century high-tech device, and allows stories in which Geordi is abducted and his VISOR misused for espionage (TNG: \"The Mind's Eye\", \"Star Trek: Generations\"). Still, the question arises why virtually any gadget must be subspace-based as if there were no other technologies in the 24th century. Geordi is blind since his birth, so he got used to see the wide spectrum provided by the VISOR, while his view was confusing for the other crew members, as was shown in TNG: \"Heart of Glory\". In TNG: \"Hide and Q\", Q fulfills Geordi's wish to perceive his environment the same way as other people. However, the same could be achieved with a simple set of filters available in any photography shop or with an electronic bandwidth reduction of the sensor element.\"\r\n\r\nCheck out my interwebs!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/geodroidjohn\r\nTwitter- @mrjohnecker\r\n\r\nBuy some 3D Printers-\r\nGearbest- https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits-c_11399/?lkid=13099383"
