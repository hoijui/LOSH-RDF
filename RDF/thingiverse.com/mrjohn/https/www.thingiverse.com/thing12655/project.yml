function: "Simple device that requires a bit of hardware and springs. Once you have them you will have an automatic extend/ retract mechanism. As the slider is moved forward it builds tension in the central spring while simultaneously overriding the lock out. Once the spring is at the height of the tension the lockout is overcome and the slider slams forward, sling shooting the extended object forward until it becomes locked out by the forward lock out. By then then the \"Slider\" is reset at the front of the the case, ready for the same action to retract the object. \r\n\r\nI've included a plate with all the files and each one as singles. Also, the Google SketchUp! file."
