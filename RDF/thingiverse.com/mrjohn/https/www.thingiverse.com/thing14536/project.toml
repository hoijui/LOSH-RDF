function = "One of my other things, the nickel calibration, only measured internal holes. This one plays off the idea that two separate known distances are better for measuring and calibration.\r\n\r\nThe small parts are 20mm and the longer ones are 40mm. The corners are all 90 degrees and will show you if you axes are square. (Use a real construction square)\r\n\r\nThe height is 3mm but I don't think it's high enough to calibrate the z. \r\n\r\nAgain the formula for calibrating is \r\n\r\nmm wanted to move/ mm actually moved= Percentage your steps are off.\r\n\r\nFind your current steps per mm in your firmware and multiply that by your percentage those steps are off. \r\n\r\nYour new number will be the new steps/mm.\r\n\r\nOrdered 50mm/ moved 54mm = 0.9259259259259259 \r\n\r\nCurrent steps 40*0.9259259259259259= new steps 37.03703703703704"
