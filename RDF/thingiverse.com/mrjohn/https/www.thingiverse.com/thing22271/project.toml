function = "On my Mosaic there isn't a lot of real estate to add a RAMPS fan. So I designed this 50mm fan mount to fit snug on the USB cable that plugs into the RAMPS board. It has two M3 bolt holes to mount the fan and works pretty well. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind, your USB cable might not be the same size as mine (11.5mm square.)\r\n\r\nI'll include the sketch up file so you can play with it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to grab this and make it parametric, please let me know. I want to learn how to do that."
