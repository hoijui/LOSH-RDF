function = "The feedback I received about my first iteration of this model lead me to redesign it into this. This one rests on the top of the Makergear Mosaic (M1) frame. It can fit in the space where the X Axis is or right above the Z lead screw as seen in the photos.\r\n\r\nThe only bolts required are the 2 M3 needed to mount the fan to this thing.\r\n\r\nI chose to make it like this because I have wired the fan in to the 12v PSU for my RAMPS. I occasionally have to transport my rig to MakerPlace here in San Diego and I unplug everything. So when I pull the plug I can just take the fan off with the PSU.\r\n\r\nI am always looking for a better, simpler solution to these types of problems, so if you have a better way that doesn't require diving into firmware or soldering anything, please teach me."
