\r
This is my first "real" part here on thingiverse. So I hope someone actually uses it and likes it. Thanks for any constructive feedback.\r
\r
Ver 1 was too big! (60mm diameter)\r
Ver 2 slot seems a bit small.\r
Ver 3 Should just end on the flat side right next to the 608 bearing, Added a couple of clips that might help.\r
Ver 4 Removed one of the clips, lowered the height to just under 2mm""" ;
