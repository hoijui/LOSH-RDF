function: "I needed a bit more room on my print bed and the only thing preventing that was the fender washers on the Y bearings. The Y carriage was bumping into them so I decided to replace them with flat sided ones.\r\n\r\nThis is my first \"real\" part here on thingiverse. So I hope someone actually uses it and likes it. Thanks for any constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nVer 1 was too big! (60mm diameter)\r\nVer 2 slot seems a bit small.\r\nVer 3 Should just end on the flat side right next to the 608 bearing, Added a couple of clips that might help.\r\nVer 4 Removed one of the clips, lowered the height to just under 2mm"
