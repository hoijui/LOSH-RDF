function = "This is the final version of my printable washer. No need to remove all the nuts and parts to add a fender washer. Plus fender washers can be hard to find. It has an open face so you can insert it directly on the threaded rod. Its bed facing side is removed to the minimum needed to allow the Y-bed to travel all the way up to bearing. More print space!"
