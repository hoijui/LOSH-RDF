function = "This is a small stand to hold your iPod Touch (G4) upright. It is very stable when holding the iPod in landscape mode, and fairly stable when holding it in portrait mode as well.  I created it so that my students could use the 6 iPod touches I have in an optics lab.  I'm still developing the lab, but to get an idea of what I'm working on you can check out this blog post from NSTA: http://nstacommunities.org/blog/2012/12/04/five-things-you-should-put-on-your-ipad-camera/\r\n\r\nThe model was made in TinkerCad - you can open and modify if you wish: https://tinkercad.com/things/9sLmVCb3qJA"
