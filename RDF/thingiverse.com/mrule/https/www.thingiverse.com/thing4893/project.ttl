\r
These two triangular pieces can be assembled into any polyhedron based on equilateral triangles. This includes tetrahedra, octahedra, icosahedra, and many others.\r
\r
The structure of the pieces is such that they resemble both faces and vertices, so the octahedron is also cube-like, and the icosahedron also looks like a dodecahedron. ( a tetrahedron is self-dual, so that doesn't count ).""" ;
