function: "update : a revised script and set which includes 4,5 and 6-fold vertices ( slash facets, not sure which to call these ) can be found at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4934 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5028.\r\n\r\nThese two triangular pieces can be assembled into any polyhedron based on equilateral triangles. This includes tetrahedra, octahedra, icosahedra, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the pieces is such that they resemble both faces and vertices, so the octahedron is also cube-like, and the icosahedron also looks like a dodecahedron. ( a tetrahedron is self-dual, so that doesn't count )."
