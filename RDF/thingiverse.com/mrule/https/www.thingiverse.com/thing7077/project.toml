function = "A quick and dirty sketch of a python clone of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6955\r\n\r\nTakes a function of x,y,r, and t (theta, in radians), plots it, returns it as a solid which it spits to stdout, or writes to a .scad or .stl file, depending on usage. Arguments are set toward the top of the scrip. The function is specified as a string. This script requires numpy. Comments need improvement.\r\n\r\nPython seems popular, so I'm hoping this will be stolen and modified. \r\n\r\nThere are probably still bugs in the mesh generation, I haven't even tried slicing the test object. If you spot a fix, tell me (or post a fix as your own thing).\r\n\r\nupdate : fixed generation of base polygons\r\nupdate : fixed normal orientation for .scad and .stl output\r\nupdate : fixed scaling issues, now scales part to the intended dimensions\r\nupdate : fixed some command line argument parsing\r\nupdate : OpenSCAD doesn't like the .stl output, but the .scad script output seems ok. Probably some problem with specifying the normals."
