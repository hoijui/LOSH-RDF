function = "In my ongoing quest to eliminate or supersede all things Matlab, I present a functional solution to the problem of extruding along arbitrary contours, written in python. \r\n\r\nThis is a reaction to http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7080, itself a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6923. Credit to both these authors for the concept and motivation.\r\n\r\nParameters are specified at the top of the script. A closed curve in 3D is specified as f:tâ†’(x,y,z) a parametric function of t. A closed curve in 2D is specified as f:sâ†’(x,y) and is used as the cross-section to extrude along the 3D curve.\r\n\r\nBonus : If you manually specify the \"crosssection\" matrix, which is a lost of [x,y] points around the perimeter, you can extrude arbitrary cross-sections.\r\n\r\ndownload, cut, edit, steal, modify, repost, use, go. \r\n\r\nupdate : I added knot.py, which simply explicitly defines the knot equations at the top and adds a couple integer parameters, similar too http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6923."
