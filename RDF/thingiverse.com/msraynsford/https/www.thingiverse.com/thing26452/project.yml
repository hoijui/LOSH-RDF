function: "I made a spiderman card for my friends birthday then went a bit nuts and added a few other designs, they all worked really well so I thought I'd share them with you here.\r\nThese cards can be found for purchase on my website if you don't have access to a laser cutter or the patience to cut them with a scalpel.\r\nhttp://msraynsford.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Spider"
