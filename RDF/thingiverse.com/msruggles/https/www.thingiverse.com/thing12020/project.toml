function = "A turners cube is a great way to test your skills on a lathe, mill or even a drill press if you've got a few screws loose upstairs. This one will test your skills on a 3D printer. This is a complete opposite of the classic turners cube with the rounds on the outside and the squares on the inside. 100mm OD. \r\n\r\nAs always, super bonus points if you print this out and post the pictures.\r\n\r\nTwisted version for those who are feeling especially brave."
