function: I made the design shorter and a little smaller to reduce cost/time to print. I also added 6 holes (5 in the pawn) in the bottom to accommodate 1/8" cubic magnets. I think for my application I only need three magnets in each piece, but it's easy to have extra designed in rather than trying to drill them later.
