function: "Wade's geared extruder modified to work in a Makerbot. This is still in the experimental stage, but my MakerBot is out of commission for the time being so I thought I would release it for someone else to try until mine is back up and running. I've included step files in case anyone wants them.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Moved axis on M8 extruder block (stl only)."
