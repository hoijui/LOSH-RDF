function = "Turret themed chess set for a board with ~1in squares. \r\n\r\nI'm working on making a chess board and due to certain constraints, I needed smaller than usual chess pieces (~1\" base). Seeing how I was already going to be making them I figured I'd create my own design instead of just scaling someone else's. I purposely stayed away from too many details on the pieces because my printer and I are in a disagreement regarding calibration and I don't want to spend my all my free time cleaning up prints. I would love to see someone detail these out (wink wink nudge nudge)."
