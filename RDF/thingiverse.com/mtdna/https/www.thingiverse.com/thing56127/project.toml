function = "Meet the megalodon shark - one of the most feared predators in Earth's history! Roaming the oceans 2 to 30 million years ago, megalodon reached 20 meters (65 feet) in length, dwarfing the modern great white (a mere 6 meters). Armed with more than 250 giant teeth, megalodon was capable of devouring whales. This terrifying creature is long extinct, but fossil teeth testifying to its size and ferocity are found regularly. The current record size for meg tooth is a monstrous 18.75 centimeters (7 3/8 inches; video here: http://youtu.be/TUyWbW3yKFI).  \r\n\r\nWith the accompanying file, you can print your own high-resolution replica of a real 11.4 centimeter (4 1/2 inch) megalodon tooth. It even comes with a stand!"
