function = "this is my implementation of a multiwii quadcopter. i decided to use a partial aluminum frame with 3d printed mounts for the motors and all the electronics. the reason being the much higher stiffness and therefore a relatively high first eigenfrequency of the whole system. this should help, to a certain extent, in reducing the rolling shutter effect when using a cmos camera.\r\na video of the quadcopter in flight can be found here:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/2AZZEHWD84U"
