function = "I have a snake of cables that essentially dock my laptop on my desk. Problem was that they would individually snake their way off the desk and onto the floor. \r\n\r\nThe idea here was to keep them together, as friends, but with the option of freeing them individually, without any moving parts.\r\n\r\nI designed the slot to accept the average cable, angled it so that removal must be deliberate, and made the trap in the middle large enough for about 8 cables, but not large enough for the heads to slip through.\r\n\r\nI also gave it a bit of girth so that it can't slip behind the crack behind the desk.\r\n\r\nModelled in sketchup, printed on a Makergear Mosaic."
