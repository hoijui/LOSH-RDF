    okh:function """My first thing.  Extremely simple design, done in 20 minutes on heekscad (with almost no prior cad experience).  Yes, it is yet another smart phone / MP3 player holder. This one is meant for the horizontal position only.\r
\r
Edit:  I've added a 2nd file (iStandrevB) that is a three legged version which should work to accommodate the perpendicular direction as well.  I have not yet printed the new version and will likely edit further to cut out some material so it won't use quite as much plastic.\r
\r
Edit:  As promised, a new version (iStand1.3) with less material.  The notches have been re-sized to 8mm as compared to 12mm on the previous 2 versions.  Assuming Skeinforge won't complain about it, I will print the 1.3 version soon and post pics.\r
\r
I'm very interested to see any copies of the revB version as I have not yet printed it.  Also, please let me know if you want any variations on this design or would like to request a source file.""" ;
