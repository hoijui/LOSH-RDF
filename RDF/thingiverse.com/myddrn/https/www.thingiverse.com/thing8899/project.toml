function = "Modified Universal Mobile Phone Stand.\r\n\r\nSquatier so that it can be a little more stable when holding a tablet sideways.  Sliced a little bit of the front rail so that you can see the entire screen of a device laying on its side.  Used OpenSCAD for the modifications (it's pretty much the best thing ever, check it out)."
