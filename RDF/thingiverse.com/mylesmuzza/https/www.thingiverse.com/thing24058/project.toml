function = "1:87 Scale V2 Rocket (about 160mm tall) modelled from a plastic kit and scaled using Solid Edge.   \n\nUpdate 19-Nov-2013 added support to base for better printing and easier removal of support material, this enables good quality printing using Slic3r (with support turned off), recommended to use Brim of 3mm+ to ensure the fins stick properly. Also advisable to use cooling fan as soon as possible to ensure quality of the fins."
