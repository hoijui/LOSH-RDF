function: "This is a holder, intended for smartphones, although it can be resized to accomodate other sorts of loads. There is a set of snap fittings on the back, to which you can attach either the stand for desktop use, or the plug which allows it to be attached to a standard microphone stand. Pair up a Bluetooth keyboard and your phone becomes a netbook!\r\n\r\nPlease note that the STLs and OpenSCAD file are defined in inches. You may need to convert to millimeters before building."
