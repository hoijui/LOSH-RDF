function = "After seeing several other cups and glasses (a couple of \"wine glasses\" actually being Martini glasses), I tossed together one of my own to add.  A full size white wine glass.  I haven't got my machine up and running yet, so this hasn't been tested, and due to the size might not be feasible for everyone. So, if you manage to make one, please let me know what you think and I'll integrate feedback into future designs.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
