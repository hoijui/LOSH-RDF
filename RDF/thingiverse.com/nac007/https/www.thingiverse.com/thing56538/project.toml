function = "I broke my Tetris shelves into the base block and added integrated dovetail connectors. Since you can print a single block at a time (instead of a full Tetris block) with this you can make much larger blocks. You can specify which sides have connectors by selecting the type of block you want. \r\n\r\nThe maximum overhang is 45 degrees, so these should be printable without support."
