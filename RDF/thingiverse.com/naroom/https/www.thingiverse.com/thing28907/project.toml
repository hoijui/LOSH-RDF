function = "Use two roller skate bearings (608) to make a rolling cylinder! This is parametric, so you can use OpenSCAD to change the size and shape. \r\n\r\nUseful for making pulleys, spools for plastic filament or thread, your own rolling pin, a rolling back massager, DIY skates, toy cars, a conveyer belt, tank treads, whatever! \r\n\r\nYou print it as two separate pieces and then put them together."
