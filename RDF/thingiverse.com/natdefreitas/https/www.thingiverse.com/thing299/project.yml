function: "UPDATE 1/26: Added the frets in with nearly the right spacing. Still working out a few last kinks before I lazzzor this.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nInspired by Bre's talk at ROFLThing in NYC yesterday, I finally hit upon the thing that has been in my head that I wanted to make real... my very own Flying V Rockin' Ukulele. The idea of being able to create a set of open-source instruments available to make on-demand is pretty exciting.\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been actually lazzzored yet, but I plan to try it this week at craft night. I am looking for feedback on material to use, design isses, tips and any other ideas you might have."
