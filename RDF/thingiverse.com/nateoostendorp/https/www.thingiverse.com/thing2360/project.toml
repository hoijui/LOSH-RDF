function = "This is a OpenSCAD model of a project enclosure box similar to the black ABS ones at Radio Shack.  I modeled this specifically to house 60mm x 80mm prototype boards, but the parameters can be set to work with any size or height clearance.   \r\n\r\nI have not yet had a successful print with this size on my Makerbot, mostly due to ABS curling -- something I hope my forthcoming HBP kit will solve.  I have printed smaller sizes and aside from the PCB mount holes being sometimes occluded, it seems to work well in various dimensions.  I expect I may need to add a few extra tolerance parameters for \"wiggle room\" as this design assumes perfect printing."
