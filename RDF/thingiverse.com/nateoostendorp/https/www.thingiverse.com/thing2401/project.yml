function: "This is a set of 4 caps for the tops of the 8mm threaded rods which control the Z-axis for the makerbot.  I have been lugging my makerbot around in my car almost every day, and got a few scratches on the glove compartment from the rough metal rod ends.  I drafted these caps in OpenSCAD, mostly to learn how to use the CSG modeling.  It's a very simple part, but it's saved me any more auto interior damage.\r\n\r\nEach cap is a cylinder with a cone segment subtracted from it.  On my 'bot they screw on fairly tight and can be used to twist the z-axis up and down.  The parts are parametric, but you probably don't need it unless you want to use it to make end caps for a different size threaded rod."
