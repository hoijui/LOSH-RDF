function = "Inspired by whowhatwhere\\'s cookie cutters, I decided to take a stab at making a more generalizable cookie cutter pattern.\r\n\r\nThis OpenSCAD script has parameters for the standard dimensions, but it also has a \\\"primitive\\\" module which you can replace with any scalable flat shape.  It creates a wall in 3 thicknesses -- a thick lip at the very bottom, a sturdy wall for most of the height, and then a single-filament-width tip at the very top."
