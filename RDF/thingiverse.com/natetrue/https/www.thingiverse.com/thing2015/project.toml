function = "A version of the Beco Block man with a few revised pieces for better posability and aesthetics.  The 'ff' female-female connector piece has been revised to be slimmer, have a tighter fit, and be easier to attach and remove.  The 'mfmf' torso piece has been redesigned to have the arms a bit higher up, too."
