function: "After using simple 1/2 inch PVC conduit as blowguns in a Nerf war, I figured I could print up a revolver to increase my firing rate.  Designed for Nerf N-Strike darts (up to 80mm length, 15mm diameter), this revolver fits six darts and can fire them one after the other (it's a blowgun, for simplicity and accuracy).\r\n\r\nIt's designed to fit snugly onto a nominal 1/2-inch PVC conduit pipe (21mm OD, 3mm wall thickness), and uses 10 4x1.5mm neodymium disc magnets to lock the chambers into alignment.\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n\r\n- If the end piece is printed airtight, when firing, some air may leak into the adjacent dart chambers and cause them to blow out of the chamber towards you.\r\n- The tolerances on the parts cause air to leak out in general, reducing the effective range of the weapon. Could possibly be improved by adding O-rings."
