function = "Based on the Coreystruder.  My MK5 filament drive cracked and blew (see images), so I needed a printable replacement filament drive on the double.  So I patched up the filament drive and printed this, a variation on the Coreystruder which was almost exactly what I needed.  Changes include:\r\n\r\n- Ribs on the motor side for better support \r\n- Reduced vertex count on holes/edges to print better\r\n- M5 screw/nut combo for tensioning the plunger, same as MK5 drive\r\n- MK5 compatible screwholes and tongues on bottom\r\n- A cover to hold the plunger in"
