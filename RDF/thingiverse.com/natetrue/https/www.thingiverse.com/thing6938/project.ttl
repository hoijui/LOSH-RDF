    okh:function """I recently upgraded to a MakerGear Prusa Mendel from a Cupcake CNC with an automated build platform, and I missed the automatic ejection of parts out the front.  So I designed a super-sized conveyor platform, re-using the gearmotor and also making use of AVataRR's paper + kapton belt design.\r
\r
Video of it working: http://natetrue.posterous.com/automated-prusa-mendel-3d-printer-win-go-prus\r
\r
In addition to the printed parts, it also requires:\r
- A Kysan DC Gearmotor A20RU-12V36RPM-15.5 (same one as the Cupcake's ABP)\r
- 200mm and 212mm lenghts of 1/2" EMT electrical conduit from a local hardware store\r
- 3x M4x20 bolts\r
- 6x M4 nuts\r
- 3x 624ZZ bearings (4mm x 13mm x 5mm)\r
- 5x M3x15 bolts\r
- 1x M3 nut\r
- Quite a bit of polyamide/kapton tape (the wider the better)\r
- Some silicone sealant or rubber cement\r
\r
Known issues:\r
- The DC gearmotor is almost not powerful enough\r
- Sometimes the belt 'wanders' one way over time and gets gummed up against the roller holders\r
- A belt this big doesn't stay very even""" ;
