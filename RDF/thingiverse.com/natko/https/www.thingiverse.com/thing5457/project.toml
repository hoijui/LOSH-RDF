function = "Ok - my take on the cupcake end stop, after trashing the kapton belt for the second time on the automated build platform v1 (ABP). This is due to Z axis skipping so until I can resolve the skipping the importance of a Z stop is critical.\r\n\r\nI had a spare microswitch and 10k resistor so came up with this, hope it save's other peoples belts.\r\n\r\nP.S. I found it really fiddly to set up but have not needed to adjust once done."
