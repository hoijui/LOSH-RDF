function: "Since finishing my spool box my desk lamp no longer lights the platform.  \nI looked at lighting in Thingiverse but the solutions required parts I didnt have or the Mk4 Plastruder.  \nSo heres my attempt using two led torches from the local store, some 15A fuse wire, and a 9.8 ohm resistor.  \nWARNING DO NOT CONNECT TO YOUR POWER SUPPLY WITHOUT A CURRENT LIMITING RESISTOR, IT WILL RESULT IN AT LEAST 1AMP CURRENT DRAW. (Warm cables to say the least).  \nAnd for the electrical engineers out there, yes you are not supposed to connect LEDS in parallel without individual resistors.   \nAlthough you can get away with it if they are the same type of LEDS in my mind (thus I bought 2 off same type torches)."
