    okh:function """This is a modification of the Prusa Air 2, modelled in FreeCAD. The purpose of this project was to make a Prusa Air-like reprap out of some old 10mm acrylic sheets I had lying around. I needed a simple design, with minimal curves, so that I could cut it by hand (no laser cutter).  



I designed from scratch, and (I think) strengthened the design, and removed the need for so many right angle brackets. The top plate now holds up the back plate, and is held down by the side plate. A bracked may be needed to stop the top plate from sliding forwards. The back plate now also has a carry handle at the top.""" ;
