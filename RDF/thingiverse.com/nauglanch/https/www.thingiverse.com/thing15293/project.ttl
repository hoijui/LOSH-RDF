    okh:function """[Edit] This failed on me. The holes are too big and the PTFE expanded into the holes under filament pressure. Now I can't extract the filament or the tube. I'm still confident it would still work but with lots of much smaller holes. Next I may just stack TO-5 heatsinks on the tube. A buck each on ePray. [/EDIT]\r
\r
This thing is a modified MK5 / MK6 thermal barrier. The hole arrangement significantly reduces heat conduction / heat soak up the thermal barrier tube.\r
\r
This arrangement of staggered holes retains structural integrity that is otherwise lost with the horizontal cut-slit method.\r
\r
This solves or greatly reduces the problem of heat soak during long prints causing filament to soften and / or jam/expand in the PTFE. \r

The thermal barrier dxf file is Makerbot's not mine.""" ;
