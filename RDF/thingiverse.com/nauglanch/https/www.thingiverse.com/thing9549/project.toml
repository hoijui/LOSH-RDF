function = "This is a derivative or alternate construction method of the Thing O Matic Z stage mod by barrychuck http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6184 . [If you can tell me how to do a linked derivative I will make it so]\r\n\r\nThe hole enlargement for the 21/32\" tubing can be problematic to do accurately. I found a way to do it in my shop using more commonly available drill sizes and tools. Accurately.\r\n\r\nBasically, if the pieces of 21/32\" tubing are sleeved, with 21/32\" tubing then they fit perfectly inside 11/16\" standard drill hole.\r\n\r\nI will otherwise confess that I found this out accidentally by thinking the 11/16\" would be perfect (slipped the tubing in a Forester bit cap and thought it fit good) but didn't do a test hole. Accidental or not - it works great.\r\n\r\nPlease remember - this is just a construction alternative derivative for http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6184 and only helps construction - so that thing itself is best for discussion and  commentary on the mod itself.  Discussion on this page should be on this construction method."
