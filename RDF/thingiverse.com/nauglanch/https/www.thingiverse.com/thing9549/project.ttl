\r
The hole enlargement for the 21/32" tubing can be problematic to do accurately. I found a way to do it in my shop using more commonly available drill sizes and tools. Accurately.\r
\r
Basically, if the pieces of 21/32" tubing are sleeved, with 21/32" tubing then they fit perfectly inside 11/16" standard drill hole.\r
\r
I will otherwise confess that I found this out accidentally by thinking the 11/16" would be perfect (slipped the tubing in a Forester bit cap and thought it fit good) but didn't do a test hole. Accidental or not - it works great.\r
\r
Please remember - this is just a construction alternative derivative for http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6184 and only helps construction - so that thing itself is best for discussion and  commentary on the mod itself.  Discussion on this page should be on this construction method.""" ;
