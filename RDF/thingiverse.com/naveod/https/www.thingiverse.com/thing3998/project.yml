function: "Solidworks files attached as .zip   You can modify for your own lettering with the .stl file that is Main Sheet BLANK.  \r\n\r\nGot idea from others on this site.  Modified parts to increase # of gears and added business card side to put info on.  \r\n\r\nTried a thinner set - but it was too flexible.  Main gear 'may' require some sanding on outside teeth based on fit and material.  \r\n\r\nThis was printed on an Alaris 30 Polyjet printer.  I used a drop of oil on the main gear to get it going - then washed it out.  Lettering is extruded cut into surface - used model paint to fill in."
