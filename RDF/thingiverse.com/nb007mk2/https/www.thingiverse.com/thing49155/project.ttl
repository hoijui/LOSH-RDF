\r
The arm part is designed to be "stackable" so that several arm pieces can be attached together - either as multiple stands off of the base or as pivot joints extended off of the arms.  See the several images with this thing for examples of how it can be used.  It fits an American/Imperial #8 hex nut and screw, and I'm sure there is a metric size that will fit too.\r
\r
The part was designed in Sketchup, repaired in Netfabb Basic, aligned in ReplicatorG, sliced with Skeinforge and printed with Pronterface on a Solidoodle 2.""" ;
