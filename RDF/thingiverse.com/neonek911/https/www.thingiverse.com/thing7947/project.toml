function = "I'm presenting you, as name suggests, printable tray for pick and place machine. This thing was designed in OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org/) so it's parametric. Parameters are described at top of .scad file. Script can generate tray of any size (component count, spacing, frame etc.) but only for rectangular components. It's good addition for Erik's SMD tape feeder (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7291)\r\n\r\nMay be used by hobbyists for semi-automatic custom PCB assembly."
