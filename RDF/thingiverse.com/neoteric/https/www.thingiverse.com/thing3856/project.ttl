Since most of the object is actually flat in the air, almost the entire object is on support.  IT WORKS GREAT.  When you are finished printing, the raft support just pulls right off with an accordian effect.\r
\r
Since I had not seen this, I posted the gcode and my raft/support settings.  This was printed without a raft.""" ;
