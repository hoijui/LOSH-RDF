function = "I needed to panel-mount a thermocouple jack on my crockpot controller but only found inline connectors for sale.  This holds the inline jack in a sleeve and provides a flange with mounting holes.\r\n\r\nThe design is parametric so should be adaptable for any connector with a rectangular cross-section, although I haven't tested with other dimensions so it might generate unexpected results."
