\r
https://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel/blob/master/source/belt-clamp.scad  \r
\r
I replaced all hard coded dimensions with variables, so now it is fully parametric.  \r
It is configured for GT2 belts but you can make it fit any belt and also modify the clamp size.  \r
The clamp is asymetric which means you can adjust your GT2 belt tension in 1mm steps(belt pitch / 2) by rotating the clamp 180deg.  \r
The belt width has been resized from 7 to 10mm to allow more room for adjusment to line up the belt with the pulleys.  \r
Thickness has been reduced from 7 to 3mm.  \r
\r
Update:  17 feb 2022\r
v2 has a cutout to accommodate for the belt thickness to prevent squeezing the belt when tightening the clamp.""" ;
