function: "This is a derivative of the following file,  \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/prusajr/PrusaMendel/blob/master/source/belt-clamp.scad  \r\n\r\nI replaced all hard coded dimensions with variables, so now it is fully parametric.  \r\nIt is configured for GT2 belts but you can make it fit any belt and also modify the clamp size.  \r\nThe clamp is asymetric which means you can adjust your GT2 belt tension in 1mm steps(belt pitch / 2) by rotating the clamp 180deg.  \r\nThe belt width has been resized from 7 to 10mm to allow more room for adjusment to line up the belt with the pulleys.  \r\nThickness has been reduced from 7 to 3mm.  \r\n\r\nUpdate:  17 feb 2022\r\nv2 has a cutout to accommodate for the belt thickness to prevent squeezing the belt when tightening the clamp."
