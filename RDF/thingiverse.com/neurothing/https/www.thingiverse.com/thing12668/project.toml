function = "This is a printable model of the Asteroid 4 Vesta, one of the largest asteroids in the main belt between Earth and Mars.  The Dawn probe is currently in orbit and its images are the source of the model.  NASA has not as of yet released a 3d model, so this is a bit of a scoop.  Vesta is a partially differentiated body and hence has a rounded shape, although much of its south pole was removed in a collision with another body."
