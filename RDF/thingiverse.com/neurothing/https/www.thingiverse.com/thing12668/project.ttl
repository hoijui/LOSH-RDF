The Dawn probe is currently in orbit and its images are the source of the model.  NASA has not as of yet released a 3d model, so this is a bit of a scoop.  Vesta is a partially differentiated body and hence has a rounded shape, although much of its south pole was removed in a collision with another body." ;
