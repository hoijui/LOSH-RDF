function = "Per request, this is a globe of the planet Mars.  The primary file (marsglobeexag2.stl - printed in natural ABS) is vertically exaggerated about 50X.  The other file (marsglobeexag.stl - printed in silver ABS) is only exagerrated about 10X.  If you print it large the less exaggerated one would be suitable for painting and display, but for my purposes (a tactile model for bringing space science to the blind) the more exaggerated is my choice. Olympia Mons looks like a nipple and Valis Marineris almost cuts through the shell."
