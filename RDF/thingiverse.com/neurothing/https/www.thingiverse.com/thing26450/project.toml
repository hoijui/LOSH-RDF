function = "3D model of the water bear or tardigrade (Echiniscus species) - possibly the most widely spread and amazingly adaptive multicellular animal on Earth.  They are cryptobiotic and have been demonstrated to be able to survive exposure to outer space for extended periods.  The animals are about 0.5 to 1.0 mm long, so this is a 60X blow-up."
