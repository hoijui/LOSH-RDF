function = "A nearly full size (for the toy) monkey to replace missing ones from your container full of primates (name changed to protect me from the copyright beasts).  The texture is a little rough (fur details are still in their infancy in Makerbot printing) so you might smooth it out by immersion in acetone for 20 minutes or so.  Try printing them in the appropriate ABS colors."
