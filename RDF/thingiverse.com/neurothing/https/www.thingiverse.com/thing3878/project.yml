function: After seeing an Instructable on how to hand craft a batarang from the video game Arkham Asylum (http://www.instructables.com/id/Batarang-from-Arkham-Asylum-Game/), I realized that I could print one almost as large and definitely quicker than I could construct one from plexi.  So here is a (partially) foldable batarang.  Note - use of the batarang will not give you crime fighting powers nor is it likely to return to you after flinging it (although it did spin nicely).
