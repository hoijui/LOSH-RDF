function: Inspired by my wife China Blue's biomimetic firefly 2.0 artbot, I designed this simple firefly bracelet.  It fits anyone from a small child to a large adult depending on high high up on your arm you wear it.  We were selling these at the Providence Maker Faire and will sell them again at the NY Maker Faire in September (along with the Firefly 2.0 robots and the kits).
