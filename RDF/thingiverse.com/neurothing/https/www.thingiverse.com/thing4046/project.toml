Phobos and Deimos are suspected to be captured cabonaceous chrondite asteroids.  These models and builds are part of a data actualization project I am starting with a local NASA office to allow creation of physical models based on elevation data from space probes and radar.  Next steps will be figuring out how to convert Hi-Rise DMT data into stl format to let me generate higher resolution models of lunar and martian terrain.  Will post em as I build em..."
