function: Asteroid models for three bodies, Castalia, Kleopatra and Geographos based on radar and optical data.  Model reconstruction is based on digital models developed by Scott Hudson of Washington State University (http://users.tricity.wsu.edu/~hudson/Research/Asteroids/models.html.  Note the models are NOT in scale relative to each other (Castalia is 1.8 X .75 km, Geographos 5.1 x 1.8 km, and Kleopatra 217 x 81 km).  The stls were sized to give reasonable size models buildable without support structures given their strange shapes.
