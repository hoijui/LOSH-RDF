function = "More in the series of asteroid models derived from RADAR data, these are the asteroids 4179 Toutatis (4.5 x 2.4 x 1.9 km) and 4486 Mithra (2-5 km).  Data for these asteroids are based on RADAR data archived at the Jet Propulsion Lab (http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/links.html).  Again these will hopefully be part of a hands-on display of data actualization in collaboration with the local NASA office."
