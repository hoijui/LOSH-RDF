function = "They're small black lo-res ABS prints, but they will be part of China Blue's upcoming Firefly Projects (http://www.chinablueart.com/FireflyProjects.html) show at the Newport Art Museum (http://www.newportartmuseum.org/pages/upcoming_exhibitions.cfm)in Newport, RI.  So now Makerbot Cupcake now makes museum-grade prints.\r\n\r\nBackstory: China Blue needed clips to hold the LEDs and leads connected to the controlling arduino for her firefly tree, so asked if I could print 100 or so of them with the wings at different angles, so I made a batch of 4 with different wing positions (FFangledclipChinaBlue.stl).  Then she wanted different decorative fireflies for her solar-charged FireFly Book, so Bookfireflies.stl has another group of 4 small bug shaped prints."
