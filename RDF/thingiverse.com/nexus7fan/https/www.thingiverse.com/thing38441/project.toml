function = "These are another z-rod stabilizer for Printrbot+.  I made this data before mikemwa upload his one so I did not compare this with his stabilizer.  The holes for z-rod of my PB+ are loose.  So z-rod are not perpendicular and always wobbling.  These help to stabilize z-rod and reduce wobbling."
