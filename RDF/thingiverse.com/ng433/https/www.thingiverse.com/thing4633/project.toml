function = "I had been looking for a chance to demonstrate to the rest of the family the utility of a 3d printer . My daughter needed to design a vehicle that would roll as far as possible after tossing a weight using a mousetrap . We used old CD's for wheels . Getting an axle into a CD was easy using a printed hub. Mounting the bearings required a wheelblock ( its designed for a 5mm ID bearing). So by printing the CD hub and the wheelblock the car was quickly assembled."
