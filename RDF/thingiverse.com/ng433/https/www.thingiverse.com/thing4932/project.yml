function: In the process of building robots i wanted to explore the use of Ultrasonic sensors for more than just obstacle avoidance. The goal is to identify door openings. I realized i had no idea how to do this. I also realized I wanted to offload some of the sensor work to another processor. This test bed was created to develop the software for navigation. In its final form I hope to create a more compact package.
