function: "If you haver ever played around with rf based remote controls trying to figure out what they are really doing is tough . I found this analyzer from Rainbow kits to be a useful tool. Its even more useful when housed in a box. It needs DOS to run so be sure you know how to use DOS.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rainbowkits.com/kits/rfa-1p.html"
