function = "This is my version of the servo bracket system by bryanandaimee. \r\nI have made a different and maybe more durable mount for the servo. Also the bracket is a little bigger because of the new mount for the servo.\r\n\r\nThe servo to fit is a MG995 cheap strong servo. But all standard size servo's should fit."
