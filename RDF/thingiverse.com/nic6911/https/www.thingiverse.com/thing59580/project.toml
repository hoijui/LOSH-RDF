function = "Derived from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24282\r\n\r\nI just removed the hand cranck, gears, bearing and replaced the parts with a brushless motor I had from a T-rex 450. There should probably be some sort of feet for mounting it on a surface, but that is up to you!\r\n\r\nIt is quite loud! So mind your neighbour :)\r\n\r\nEdit 20/3/2013:\r\nNew impeller unit with screw for fixating the wheel on the axis of the motor."
