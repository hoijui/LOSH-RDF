function = "Derived from thingiverse.com/thing:24282\r\n\r\nI have made a new housing for an old 540 motor I borrowed. The new housing fits a 540 motor and has feet for mounting.\r\nI have made a video with the 540 running the fan. The 540 is old an defect so it takes 20 amps of my powersupply and drops the voltage to around 3-4V! But it makes a lot of noise though!\r\n\r\nVideo: youtube.com/watch?v=HVBQGiebi9M\r\n\r\nEdit 20/3/2013:\r\nNew impeller unit with screw for fixating the wheel on the axis of the motor."
