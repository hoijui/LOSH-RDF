function = "This shield allows you to connect a HP C6602 inkjet cartridge to your Arduino turning it into a 96dpi print platform.  It only uses 5 pins which can be jumper selected to avoid other shields.  It is designed with a Arduino Mega footprint but fully supports both the Arduino and the Arduino Mega.  It uses all through-hole components to make assembly easy even for beginners.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nCompatible with Arduino and Arduino Mega\r\nUses only 5 user selectable pins\r\nStackable (up to 11 Inkshields on Ardunio, 15 on Mega)\r\nOn-board 20V boost converter for inkjet head\r\nAccepts 9-12V input via optional power connector or from the Arduino Vin\r\nAuxiliary input header offers support for other microcontrollers \r\nAuxiliary output header supports an extension cable to the inkjet head\r\nPower and Pulse activity LEDs\r\nISCP header and Reset button\r\nAll through-hole components\r\n\r\nThis will be the first official release location.
