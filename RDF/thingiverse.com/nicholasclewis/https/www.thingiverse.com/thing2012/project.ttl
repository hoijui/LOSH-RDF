    okh:function """A Moai Necklace inspired by \\"Moai Necklace by open3dp.\\" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1986  It was modeled using SAGE and Implicit Solid Modeling.  The horizontal holes were designed with pointed tops and should print on a RepRap style 3D Printer.\r
\r
The Scaled25 is bigger than the Scaled10.\r
The Straight version is the one with straight sides instead of curved ones.\r
\r
I have now added the equation, in a txt file, that describes the surface and a txt file version of the SAGE script that generated the model.\r
\r
I have now added two versions of the stl files with fewer faces.  These should be easier to print.\r
\r
The SAGE ISM script was developed during a class at the Solheim Rapid Prototyping Lab @ Univ. of WA.""" ;
