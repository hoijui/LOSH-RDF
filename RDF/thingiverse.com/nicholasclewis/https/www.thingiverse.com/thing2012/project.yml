function: "A Moai Necklace inspired by \\\"Moai Necklace by open3dp.\\\" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1986  It was modeled using SAGE and Implicit Solid Modeling.  The horizontal holes were designed with pointed tops and should print on a RepRap style 3D Printer.\r\n\r\nThe Scaled25 is bigger than the Scaled10.\r\nThe Straight version is the one with straight sides instead of curved ones.\r\n\r\nI have now added the equation, in a txt file, that describes the surface and a txt file version of the SAGE script that generated the model.\r\n\r\nI have now added two versions of the stl files with fewer faces.  These should be easier to print.\r\n\r\nThe SAGE ISM script was developed during a class at the Solheim Rapid Prototyping Lab @ Univ. of WA."
