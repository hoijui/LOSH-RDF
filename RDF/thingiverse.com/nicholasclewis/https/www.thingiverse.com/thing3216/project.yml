function: "This is a derivative of Vik's OpenSCAD version of the the leadscrew base.  It has been combined with a motor mount and no longer needs the z-tensioner part.  It will also save you two of the threaded rods on the bottom.  You will also need a shorter belt.  It is now a 34\"-35\" belt.  I am using a 35\" and the motor is a little over halfway up the slot.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out my Mendel build log at http://reprapbreeding.blogspot.com/"
