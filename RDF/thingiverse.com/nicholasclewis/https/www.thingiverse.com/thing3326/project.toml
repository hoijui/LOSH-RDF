function = "This is a RepRapable feed spool for Mendel or with slight modification any printer.  The design sits on top of the Mendel using y-bar clamps to hold it on.  It could easily be made with normal vertexes on the bottom and be stand alone.  The frame vertex is a adaptation of Vik's Footed Parametric Frame Vertex http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2003.  You could use standard vertexes and just add washers.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out pictures and more information about my Mendel @ http://reprapbreeding.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nThis has now been tested with a 5lb roll of PLA on it and it works very well.  I added some more pictures showing this.  I also have a video on YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFcND7u_Sqk showing it in action (while printing in PLA that glows under black light)"
