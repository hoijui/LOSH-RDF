function = "These are my new thick sheet parts for RepRap Mendel.  I was inspired by the mounting plate for the TechZone boards (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2174).  I used a modified version of this for my mother board and extruder.  And then made a board for my steppers.  I have also included my modified froglet that is simpler for cutting out with saws.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out pictures and more information about my Mendel @ reprapbreeding.blogspot.com/"
