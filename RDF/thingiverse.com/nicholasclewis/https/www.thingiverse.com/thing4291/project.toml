function = "This is second iteration of a derivative of Vik's OpenSCAD version of the the leadscrew base. It has been combined with a motor mount and no longer needs the z-tensioner part.  The change to this version is to simplify the design by removing the triangular section.  This makes it faster to print and solves some problems with slicing in RepSnapper.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check out my Mendel build log at reprapbreeding.blogspot.com/"
