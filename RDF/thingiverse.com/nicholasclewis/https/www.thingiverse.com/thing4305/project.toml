The small gear is based on Nophead's grub screw version http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2521.\r\n\r\nI made these because I was having trouble slicing the old versions with RepSnapper (it can be very picky).  These versions also allow changing the ratio or other features of the gear more easily as they are modeled in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nI am using Vik's mendel_misc.inc found here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2192"
