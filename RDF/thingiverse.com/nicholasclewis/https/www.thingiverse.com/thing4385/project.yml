function: "This is a ghost figurine.  I have included the original Rhino file as well as several versions of the files (different face counts).   There are two different models of ghost, one has a \\\\\\\"tail\\\\\\\" and the other does not.\r\n\r\nThe ghosts pictured were printed with Blue UV happy PLA from UltiMachine (http://ultimachine.com/content/pla-blue-translucent-5lb) and would be very cool printed in Makerbot\\'s glow-in-the-dark ABS (http://store.makerbot.com/plastic/glow-abs-plastic-1lb.html)."
