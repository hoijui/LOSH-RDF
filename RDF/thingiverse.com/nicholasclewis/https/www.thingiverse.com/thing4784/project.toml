function = "These are experimental simplified versions of the guide bearings for all three axis on a Mendel type printer.  They are NOT direct replacements and will require other modifications to work.\r\n\r\nThese are a part of my Mendel/Huxley \"remix\" currently code named \"Mindel\" (for MINimal MenDEL) (UPDATE 11/26/10 - project renamed \"Integrated Parametric RepRap\").  These are not ready for prime time but I am releasing them now in the spirit of \"release early, release often.\"\r\n\r\nFollow the progress at http://reprap.org/wiki/Integrated_Parametric_RepRap"
