These two files contain the following:\r\nIPR_DNA: All constants and calculations, the constants define all the possible things that make a specific robot unique. (ranging from desired build space to fastener and bearing sizes)\r\nIPR_func: All \"standard\" modules, such as motor mounts, bearing mounts, hardware models, etc... currently this file \"builds\" the main frame out of the hardware specified in the IPR_DNA file (as seen in the attached pictures).\r\n\r\nFor more information visit the main documentation at:\r\nhttp://reprap.org/wiki/Integrated_Parametric_RepRap"
