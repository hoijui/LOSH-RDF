function = "This is a second pre-release of the core files for the my development of an Integrated Parametric RepRap in OpenSCAD. These files contain the following:\r\nIPR_DNA: All constants and calculations, the constants define all the possible things that make a specific robot unique. (ranging from desired build space to fastener and bearing sizes)\r\nIPR_func: All \"standard\" modules, such as motor mounts, bearing mounts, hardware models, etc... currently this file \"builds\" the main frame out of the hardware specified in the IPR_DNA file (as seen in the attached pictures).\r\nIPR_parts: All the actual parts you would print.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are some printable parts (although still untested):\r\nz-axis bases\r\nguide rod clamps (based on thing:3437)\r\nz-axis lifters (inspired by thing:4428)\r\n\r\nAnd some unprintable:\r\nVertexes (with no holes)\r\n\r\nFor more information visit the main documentation at:\r\nreprap.org/wiki/Integrated_Parametric_RepRap"
