function = "These are all the gears needed for a Mendel with a Wade's Extruder.  This was made using Rhino3D's contour function to slice the gears into 3mm slices. \r\n\r\nIncluded are sliced versions of:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4305  (Wade's Gears)\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2079  (Drive Pulleys)\r\nStock Z-axis pulleys\r\n\r\nThese cut out well and look dimensionally correct.  I have not glued them together and tried them on a Mendel yet."
