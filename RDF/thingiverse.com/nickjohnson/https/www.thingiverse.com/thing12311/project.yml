function: "This is a pinch valve for 6mm silicon tubing, made from laser-cut 3mm acrylic, stacked and held together with machine screws. It's ideal for controlling the flow of air, water, fruit juice, hard liquor, or whatever you desire. It's ideal for controlling the flow of stuff you don't want to risk contaminating with a regular valve, and as a result it's intrinsically food-safe.\r\n\r\nPower and control is provided by a lightweight '9g' hobby servo; the silicon tubing is simply a push-fit into the top of the valve arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe photos and video are of an earlier prototype; the uploaded design is slightly refined, but functionally identical.\r\n\r\nYou can see it in action here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4raXnoKUtow"
