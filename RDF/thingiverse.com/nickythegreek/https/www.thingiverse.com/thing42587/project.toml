function = "This is a modified version of cmetzels filament guide to accept a felt dremel polishing wheel (#414) in the back to clean the filament instead of a sponge.  Its length also helps keep octave filament from jumping off  the spool and it is a better fit if you are using the official solidoodle case. The inside piece is unchanged, so if you already printed cmetzel's original you only need to print the outside part."
