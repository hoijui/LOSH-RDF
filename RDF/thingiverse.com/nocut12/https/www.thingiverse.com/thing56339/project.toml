function = "A bust of a grizzled old alien I drew up in Sculptris.\r\n\r\nHe's pretty high poly (roughly 100k triangles), so he'll be a pretty good demonstration of your printer's quality.\r\n\r\nAnd if your printer messes up near the end (like in my first attempt), he makes a pretty nice container for your tools!\r\n\r\nI've attached the Sculptris file in case you want to make some changes of your own. The base isn't flattened in this version."
