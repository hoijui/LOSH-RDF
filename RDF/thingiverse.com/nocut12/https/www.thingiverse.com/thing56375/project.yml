function: "When configuring my printer, I realized I would need to be able to adjust the Z-endstop more precisely than I had previously assumed. \r\n\r\nOn my printer, the endstop is attache to X-axis's gantry. In order to precisely adjust when the endstop triggered, I designed this.\r\n\r\nThis was made for a certain type of nut (part # 92461A200 on McMaster).\r\n\r\nI've attached the Sketchup file, in case you want to make any adjustments."
