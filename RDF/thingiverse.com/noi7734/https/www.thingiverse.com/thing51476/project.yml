function: "found some good ones on here, but they all either printed in 2 separate pieces, or held my guitar too close to the wall and it was unstable.  Here's my take on a universal single piece guitar hanger.\r\n\r\nMK2 added 2/20/13\r\nImprovements:\r\nguitar axis closer to wall for stability\r\nrounded edges to prevent damage to guitar\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\nSlic3r does not like this stl file, I must have made a mistake in the sketch up, working on a fix."
