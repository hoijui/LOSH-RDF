function: Just an outline for a prop piece. Holes are to be done manually because of ow you want to wire it. Outer ring is for led with a Plexiglas ring over it. Roughly 4 inches no diameter and 1 inch tall. 99% sure this should print. Yet to try it my self... The image of the device is what it should look like after printing!
