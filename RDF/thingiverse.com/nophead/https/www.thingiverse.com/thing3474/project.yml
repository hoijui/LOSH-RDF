function: "I have uploaded this by request. It is simply the original pulleys and rims with the pulleys built on top of the lower rim to save build area.\r\n\r\nMBC has also uploaded a fully integrated version http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1936 but that requires a 45 degree overhang, which is tricky to print."
