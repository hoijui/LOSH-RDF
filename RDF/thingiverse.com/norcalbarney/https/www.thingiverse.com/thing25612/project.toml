function = "Well, I went a little crazy with Ceterumnet's iPhone case, thing #22572.  The images are roughly in the order they were created.  This is absolutly inspired by RichRap, who was the first that I saw do live filament swaps. Most of the credit should go to Alexrj at slic3r. org for All the cool patterns in Slic3r.\r\n\r\nI modded the Greg's Wade's Adrian's extruder so that I can switch filament on the fly.  I basically made the hole below the hobbed bolt into a funnel, so that the Cut-N-Follow filament switch would work.  I did this with a single extruder, 3mm filament and a 0.46mm hottip. I also uploaded my modded Greg's with a Budaschnozzle mount because Thingiverse requires a model to publish.\r\n\r\nI only print in PLA because ABS is bad for the planet.  It's also pretty.\r\n\r\nIf you use this technique, please upload your images as a derivative.  I can't wait to see where people go with this."
