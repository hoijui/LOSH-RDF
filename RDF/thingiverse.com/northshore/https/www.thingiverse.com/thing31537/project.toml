function = "Updated files loaded.. no need for external support on the aileron, makes for a 50% faster print. Further revision with increased pin size for strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the title.. 3 parts, a left and right wing spar, with an interally fitted aileron / flap, with hinge pins.\r\n\r\n\r\nMade for use with 1.2mm balsa sheet on the leading and trailing edges, a balsa beam in adjacent the trailing edge as well as a 6.1mm square carbon rod for the centre support.\r\n\r\nThe opening behind the COG has been sized to fit a 5g servo.\r\n\r\nThere is also a pad on the aileron for mounting the control horn in either a left or right hand configuration.\r\n\r\nHeat shrink film covering is recommended, or celophane with spray adhesive, but this does tend to break down with uv exposure."
