    okh:function """Updated files loaded.. no need for external support on the aileron, makes for a 50% faster print. Further revision with increased pin size for strength.\r
\r
\r
As per the title.. 3 parts, a left and right wing spar, with an interally fitted aileron / flap, with hinge pins.\r
\r
\r
Made for use with 1.2mm balsa sheet on the leading and trailing edges, a balsa beam in adjacent the trailing edge as well as a 6.1mm square carbon rod for the centre support.\r
\r
The opening behind the COG has been sized to fit a 5g servo.\r
\r
There is also a pad on the aileron for mounting the control horn in either a left or right hand configuration.\r
\r
Heat shrink film covering is recommended, or celophane with spray adhesive, but this does tend to break down with uv exposure.""" ;
