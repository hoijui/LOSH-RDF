    okh:function """Designed as a stable high lift trainer wing for the Hobby Zone mini cub.\r
\r
Includes, left and right fuselage joiners and wing tips as well as the spar sections.\r
\r
There is a centre joiner piece included for a straight wing, which will need to be resized as required.. nominal recommendations are 17mm wide, unless you want to extend to use it as a single piece for the width of the fuselage (suitable for those with a brushless conversion only).\r
\r
Can be assembled with or without the 5 degree joiners, or use the 15 degree joiner for a poly wing (with angled wing tip sections).\r
\r
The stl file with the two wing tips contains a shortened version of these parts.. seems to work fine, saves - 5 - 6 grams.\r
\r
Notes post first flight.. is a very high lift wing, requires additional weights to ensure a nose down balance point. \r
\r
The Version 8 files are a less agressive lift profile, is matched to the Version 5 centre spar for the centre join, wing tips and angled joiners included.""" ;
