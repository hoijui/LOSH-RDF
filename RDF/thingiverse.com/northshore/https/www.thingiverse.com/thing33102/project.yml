function: "24 Nov - Updates to the full ABS version with a 1400mm wing span also available http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33732 \r\n\r\n\r\n06 Nov -  Slight tweaks to the rudder and tail fin... nothing that could not be done during the fitting process, just a minor refinement.\r\n\r\n04 Nov - To avoid any confusion I have reduced the nunmber of files here and published a separate model for the full ABS version. \r\n\r\n1 Nov - Updated nose cone / engine mount.\r\n\r\n30 Oct - Instructions updated.\r\n\r\nBased on a cub / trainer design aircraft, this thing is under construction to be a fully printable remote control aircraft.\r\n\r\nMore pics and the rest of the design to come as soon as I get a couple of parts from Hong Kong to complete the fuselage. The default pic is the assembled hull plus wings, pending reinforcement of the nose section with carbon tissue and then the heat shrink skin over the rest of the body."
