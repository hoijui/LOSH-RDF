1 sheet, 3mm foam board (tail section)\r
Supa glue and hot melt glue gun / sticks\r
2 or 4x 5g servos - tail plus alierons\r
\r
24 Nov - New wing parts for a 6 / 13 degree poly wing option (200mm chord version only) plus  updated instructions.\r
\r
21 Nov - 200mm chord wing, left and right wing tips added, instructions updated.\r
\r
20 Nov - lighter version of the  15 degree wing joiner uploaded, trainer width aileron updated also.\r
\r
19 Nov - Major crash on SKU, lost a weeks solid work unfortunately, am also waiting on advice re replacement parts in AUS for my Bot.. so all in all, is progressing slower than desired.\r
\r
I have uploaded what NEW files and parts I have tested and will look forward to completing this version as soon as possible, including a new set of instructions and parts list.\r
\r
Two wing designs included in this version.. on with a 150mm chord, the second 200mm, (both in a Clark Y profile) for a lower landing speed, both are 1400 mm long, in a polyhedhral configuration.\r
\r
Parts included for a dihedhral wing if desired for both variants.\r
\r
Both wing sets have been loaded as zip files.\r
\r
The current tie down brackets and wing mount will suit the 150mm version of the wing only.\r
\r
\r
09 Nov - After a series of flight trials it has not been possible to extend the hybrid version and maintain the same flight characteristics on a full ABS model. Is easy enough to fix. I have marked this version as a work in progress. Am presently redesigning an longer version, 1300mm wing span, with a 1300mAhr battery and larger motor to suit.\r
\r
rudder and tail fin... nothing that could not be done during the fitting process, just a minor refinement.\r
\r
05 Nov - Updated wing profile loaded with joiners and wing mounts, increased lift and slightly longer chord, but still within the requried ratios for the current stabiliser and tail fin.. not tested as yet.. but if anyone builds it inside the next week please let me know how it goes.. :). Recommended OAL wing length is 850 - 950mm. Adjusted rear wing mount bracket to follow, which will be at slightly closer centres than the current version. Zip file added for the new wing parts.\r
\r
Also added the standard length tail section (as opposed to the short tail version in the zip file) as well.. fuselage length with this component is approx 68mm longer (is called tail section V3).\r
\r
Modifications to the ABS / PS foam hybrid plane as published a few weeks back to restore the static balance and update the relevant build details.\r
\r
Rather than having to download the files individually I have added a zip file of the .stl's.""" ;
