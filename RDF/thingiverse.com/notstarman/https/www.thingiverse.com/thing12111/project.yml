function: "This part repairs the clicking brush behavior. This is reported by Roomba as an error two or \xE2\u20AC\u0153Please remove and clean Roomba\xE2\u20AC\u2122s brushes.\"\r\nThe formal description of the problem is located here. http://uksupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/978/~/roomba-500-series-main-brush-issues\r\n\r\nThe Roomba 500 series has a design flaw which allows dirt and hair to enter the gear case. Once the dirt is inside of the case, the dirt causes nothing but problems. In my case it caused enough heat to melt the barring plate to the point that its beyond repair."
