function = "\"Inspired by\" the Hakko FA-400, this is a solder fume extractor designed to be used either horizontally for greater suction speed or verically for greater suction volume.  In the .stl files attached, it is configured to use a 120mm fan and the 130mm by 130mm carbon filter that goes with the actual Hakko extractor and its various knockoffs.  The filters for the Weller benchtop fume extractor should also fit.  The .scad file is parametric, so changing to a different sized fan or filter should just be a matter of changing a few numbers."
