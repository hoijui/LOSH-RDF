function = "I wanted to conveniently be able to swap a Kinect and a DSLR on Manfrotto tripod with a 701HDV head on it, so I made a quick release plate compatible with the 501PL plate that I have.  The OpenSCAD file has parameters to adjust the thickness and length.  The default values, which the STL was generated with, result in a plate the same size as a real 501PL."
