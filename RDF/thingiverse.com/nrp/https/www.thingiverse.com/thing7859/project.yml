function: "Really, the best description is the video:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRJY927raTo\r\n\r\nAlso on my website:\r\nhttp://eclecti.cc/computervision/gestural-printing-jumping-the-shark-on-kinect-hacks\r\n\r\nWe\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve seen a seemingly endless array of amazing Kinect hacks over the last few months, from superhero generators to obstacle avoiding quadcopters.  However, it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a hack so inane and irrelevant that it would bring shame to the entire hobby.  That time is now, and that someone is me.  I bring to you, gestural 3D printing!  Using the Kinect to track your hand, you can draw one layer at a time, with the printer following your every move.  Pushing forward extrudes plastic, while pulling your hand back will start a new layer.  Who needs difficult and confusing CAD software when you can just directly draw the object you want to print?"
