The cup fits into the holder.  The handle is shaped so that it is easy for a hand to slide in and out with ease.  The holder fits snuggly around the cup to prevent the cup from moving.  This is important for people that cannot grasp a cup without a handle or with handles too small to fit the prosthetic limb through." ;
