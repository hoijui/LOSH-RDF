function: This is a holder for a disposable cup to help people with prosthetic limbs or limited grip strength to be able to drink from a disposable cup (one without a handle).  The cup fits into the holder.  The handle is shaped so that it is easy for a hand to slide in and out with ease.  The holder fits snuggly around the cup to prevent the cup from moving.  This is important for people that cannot grasp a cup without a handle or with handles too small to fit the prosthetic limb through.
