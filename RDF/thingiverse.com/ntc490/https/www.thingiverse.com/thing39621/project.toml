function = "Grommet for hole with 1\" diameter.  Use on your desk, a cabinet or similar application.\r\n\r\nThis model has been printed with an UP! printer.  Used it for the inside of a cabinet.  The lock ring finished off the underside a little better and keeps things from sliding around.\r\n\r\n\r\nBTW - Adding a hash for posted files seems like a great idea.  I've suggested thingiverse add it as part of their website.  Use 'md5sum' on your files and then look them up if you're not sure where they came from.  Doesn't make so much sense unless everyone's files are tagged, though.  :(\r\n\r\n740686177afb4ea1634b1ef4dc070e53  1 Inch Hole Grommet.skp\r\n1632651f28f5fdad84edb17a90fff739  LockRing.stl\r\n2f9a9895520475ca3ec9f5176645746f  NarrowGrommet.stl\r\n019bfb34d0830bf110d2de983ba22275  WideGrommet.stl"
