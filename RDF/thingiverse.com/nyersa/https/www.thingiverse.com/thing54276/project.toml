function = "Pre-Incan ceramic sherd from the Ibarra province in northern Ecuador. They are most likely local Caranqui ware with vessel shapes ranging from bowls to large, round jars.\r\n\r\nCreated using a nextengine 3d scanner, then skinned with a poisson surface reconstruction in meshlab and finally checked for any errors with netfabb studio. Should be ready to go, however it has yet to be tested.I have added a ply to the file as well that contains color information."
