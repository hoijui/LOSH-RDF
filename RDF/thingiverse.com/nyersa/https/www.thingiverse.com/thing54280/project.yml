function: "*** sorry folks, I had to remove this model due to a complaint from bone clones. ***   \n\nReplica was scanned using a nextengine 3d scanner, then skinned with a poisson surface reconstruction in meshlab and finally checked for any errors with netfabb studio. Checkout a blender rendering of this scan at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcaEwGoguz4&hd=1 and http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Homo_habilis-KNM_ER_1813.jpg for a photo.  \nThought I would add one more picture.  My daughter really wanted a unique nightlight and liked the skull, so I took a radioshack led and stuck it inside. You can see the result attached (sorry for the poor focus)."
