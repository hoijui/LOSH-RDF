function = "This design is a mechanical module for building modular printbots (printable robots).\r\nThe main improvement of this design over v1.0 is that it has been migrated from Blender to Openscad. Therefore the drills and part's thickness are parametric.\r\n\r\nThe documentation has been done with Freecad. For more details just download and open the freecad files\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build the longest modular snake robot ever! :-D\r\n\r\nThere are more information (in Spanish) about these modules in the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=M%C3%B3dulos_REPY-1"
