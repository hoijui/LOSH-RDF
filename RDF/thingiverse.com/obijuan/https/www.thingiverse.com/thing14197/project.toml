function = "The Skymega is an electronic board for programming printbots. It is open source hardware, designed with the open source tools Kicad (we have named this kind of hardware as open source squared). It is based on the ATmega microcontrollers, so it is Arduino compatible.\r\n\r\nThis board has been specifically designed for building modular robots or mini mobile robots. Currently we are using it at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid for the following printbots:\r\n\r\n* Miniskybot: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7989\r\n* Repy1 1.1 modules: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13442\r\n* F-track: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13298\r\n* Orugator: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8559\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Small in size\r\n* Easy to build by the students\r\n* ON/OFF switch\r\n* Arduino compatible\r\n* Connection up to 8 servos\r\n* I2C bus\r\n* 1 Test button\r\n* 2 Test led\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n* Juan Gonzalez-Gomez (Obijuan)\r\n* AndrÃ©s Prieto-Moreno\r\n* Itziar Lima\r\n* Ricardo Gomez\r\n\r\nMore information on this board (repository, images, instructions) can be found on this link (in Spanish): http://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=SkyMega"
