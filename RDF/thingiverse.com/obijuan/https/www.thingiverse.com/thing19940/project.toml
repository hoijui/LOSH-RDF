The improvements of the Version 4.0 are:\r\n* Adaptation to the 3 types of Futaba 3003 servo horns: rounded, 4-arms and 6-arms\r\n* New drills for attaching the horns. Now it is easier to screew the horns to the wheels\r\n\r\nThe sources are stored in the Miniskybot 2 github:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Obijuan/Miniskybot/"
