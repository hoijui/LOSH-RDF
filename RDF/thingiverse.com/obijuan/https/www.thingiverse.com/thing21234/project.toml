function = "It is a proof of concept of a kind of printable spring. Initially I designed it for using in my Prusa Mendel, because the z axis springs were very difficult to find for me.  Then I generalized the idea and parameterized the spring.\r\n\r\nThese springs conceptually consist of a strip of plastic that is bended. The outer cross section of the spring can be square, hexagonal or octogonal.\r\n\r\nThe spring parameters are:\r\n* fid (fold inner diameter)\r\n* folds: Number of folds\r\n* th: strip thickness\r\n* Drill: Drill diameter\r\n* Diameter of the outer cross section\r\n\r\nHere there is a video of the proof of concept:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbjiXFEyg_E"
