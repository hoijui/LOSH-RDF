function = "Ardusnake is an Arduino Library for generating easily the locomotion of modular snake robots or other modular robots. It is based on sinusoidal oscillators which drive the servos.\r\n\r\nHere you can see a video of the locomotion of a 2-module worm:\r\n\r\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=jbBX5QE6ZFk\r\n\r\nIt also work for longer worms or even snakes (I will add more information about it on the future)\r\n\r\nYou can find more information, examples, tutorials, pictures, etc in this wiki:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=ArduSnake:_Arduino_Modular_Snake_Robots_Library\r\n\r\nand the github repository:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Obijuan/ArduSnake"
