function: "These are parameterized connectors for building small domes for learning. They are based on effalo's V2 dome kit.\r\n\r\n  I have re-written the scad files so that now it is possible to make small connectors that work with wooden sticks of very small diameter (3mm or less).\r\n\r\n  I have tested it building 2 domes that I've called as Mini-dome and Micro-dome, with diameters of 50cm and 15cm respectivelly. I have used wooden sticks with section of 3 and 2 mm, that are very cheap and very easy to find.\r\n\r\n  The connectors are parameterized. The user has to introduce the stick diameter (in mm) and the holedepth. The size of the connector (radius and height) will be automatically calculated.\r\n\r\n(More information in Spanish)\r\nLa versi\xC3\xB3n en Espa\xC3\xB1ol la puedes ver aqu\xC3\xAD:\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Objeto_3D:_Mini_domo"
