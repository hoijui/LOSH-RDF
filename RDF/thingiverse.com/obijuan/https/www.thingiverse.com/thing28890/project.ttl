\r
The history:   In 8 hours I was going to leave Madrid for having holidays with my family... Suddenly I discovered that the handles of the portable DVD player were broken...  I had to drive my car for more than 6 hours... with 2 kids  (2 and 4 years old) and without the DVD! It was going to be terrible!!!  What to do?\r
\r
I designed a belt holder in openscad in 20 minutes. Then I printed it on my Prusa I2 and finally I glued the parts to the DVD.  Fixed! Problem solved!  Thanks prusa! Thanks Reprap!  \r
\r
  The trip was so nice and calm.. :-)""" ;
