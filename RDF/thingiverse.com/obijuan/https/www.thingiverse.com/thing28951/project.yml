function: "The Prusa iteration 2 modelled in Blender 2.5. All the STLs parts of the official Prusa 2 have been imported into Blender. All the vitamins have been designed in OpenScad, exported to STL and imported into Blender.\r\n\r\nThis model is very useful for generating documentation. The users can explore the design to see how the different parts are attached. In addition, animations can be generated in Blender.\r\n\r\nBlender is a multi-platform open-source high-quality application. Although it has not been explicitly designed for Engineering, is rather easy to import STLs parts and create complex 3D models.\r\n\r\nYou can see a video here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fOu8MF8ZJg\r\n\r\nGithub repository:\r\nhttps://github.com/Obijuan/Prusa2-Blender\r\n\r\nWiki page (in Spanish):\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Prusa2_Blender"
