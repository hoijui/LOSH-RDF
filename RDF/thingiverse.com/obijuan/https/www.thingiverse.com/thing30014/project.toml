function = "This is a Vector library for drawing vectors in Openscad. It is extremely useful for designing robots and viewing their kinematics. In addition, it gives a lot of help when designing parts by means of displaying auxiliary vectors and frames of reference.\r\n\r\n  Another very useful operator is  \"orientate()\" which make the child to point in the direction given by a vector. \r\n\r\nThe vector library is part of the tools I am developing for making it easier the use of Openscad. These tools are called obiscad. They are located in this repo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Obijuan/obiscad/\r\n\r\nMore information (in spanish) in this page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Obiscad"
