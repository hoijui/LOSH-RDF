function: "Openscad library for easily attaching parts. This is an experimental work on enhancing the openscad tool. Usually the code written by users is difficult to read and understand. If we want to share the code and to reuse parts made by others, it is very important to write clean code.\r\n\r\n  The attach operator is a experimental way of joining together parts. It just hides all the translate/rotate operators to the user, making the code easier to read, maitain and reuse.\r\n\r\nI have written about it (and given an example of use) in this post:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/blog/2012/09/10/enhancing-openscad-with-the-attach-library/\r\n\r\nThe attach operator is part of the obiscad tools I am developing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Obijuan/obiscad\r\n\r\nMore information in this wiki (in Spanish):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Obiscad"
