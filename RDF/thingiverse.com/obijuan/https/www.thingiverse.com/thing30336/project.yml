function: "There is one very common operation that has to be done in nearly all the designs: beveling edges. It can be done on the convex side, for avoiding sharp edges, or on the concave side, for reinforce the part (avoiding the 90 degrees connection between parts).\r\n\r\nWith the bevel library I am developing doing these two operations is a piece of cake.\r\n\r\nI have given some examples in this post:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/blog/2012/09/13/enhancing-openscad-ii-bevel-library/\r\n\r\nThe bevel library is part of the obiscad tools I am developing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Obijuan/obiscad\r\n\r\nMore information in this wiki (in Spanish):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Obiscad\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Miguel Angel de Frutos (MAF, http://www.thingiverse.com/MAF ) for his technical advices"
