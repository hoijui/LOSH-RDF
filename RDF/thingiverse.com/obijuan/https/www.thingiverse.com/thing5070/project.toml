function = "This is a proof of concept. I have derived this object from the parameterized Battery compartment: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5051.\r\n\r\nIt is a Battery comparment for just 1 AAA battery. I have added two embedded nuts in contact with the positive and negative parts of the battery. From the outside, two metal screws are inserted. They will contact with the battery.  Now, you have a wonderful electrical access to the battery!!\r\n\r\nIt works very well.\r\n\r\nFor the future, I am planning to add this feature to the original parameterized battery comparment."
