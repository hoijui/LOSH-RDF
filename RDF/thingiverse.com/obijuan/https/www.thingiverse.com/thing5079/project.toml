function = "This design is derived from the parameterized Battery compartment: thingiverse.com/thing:5051 (By Guru). I have added a simple method for the electrical connections. The proof of concept was tested on this thing: thingiverse.com/thing:5070\r\n\r\nNOW you can print your own fully-functional battery pack :-)\r\n\r\nFor every battery there are two embedded nuts in contact with the positive and negative poles. Two metal M3 bolts are inserted from the outside. They will contact with the poles. Now, you have a wonderful electrical access to the battery!!\r\n\r\n  I have tested with 2-AAA and 4-AAA battery packs. It worked like a charm :-)\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have added more parameters for generating the battery pack: the thickness of the bottom, front and rear, and side walls as well as the distance between two batteries.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Jan/30/2011. Added the contribution of eaglepex ( http://www.thingiverse.com/eagleapex ). Now the batteries can also be in serial connection changing the ser parameter"
