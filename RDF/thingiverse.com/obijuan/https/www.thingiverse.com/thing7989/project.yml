function: "The MiniSkybot is a new mobile robot aimed for educational purposes. It has three new important features: 3D-printable, fully open-source (mechanics + electronics) and designed exclusively with Open source tools (OpenScad, Freecad and Kicad)  \n\nThis robotic platform allows the students not only to learn robot programming, but also to modify easily the chassis and create new custom parts. Being open source the robot can be freely modified, copied, and shared across the Internet. In addition, it is extremely cheap, being the cost almost exclusively determined by the cost of the servos, electronics and sensors.  \n\nThis work is being done between three professors from the Robotics Lab at Carlos III University of Madrid and one part-time teacher at Universidad Autonoma the Madrid:  \n\n* Dr. Juan Gonzalez-Gomez (UC3M)  \n* Andres Prieto-Moreno (UAM)  \n* Dr. Alberto Valero (UC3M)  \n* Dr. Mohammed Abderrahim (UC3M)  \n\nAlso, there are serveral engineering students involved.  \n\nThe robot chassis has been design with Openscad. More information can be found on this link: http://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Mini-Skybot_v1.0  \n\nThe electronics consist of the open-source hardware Skycube board (http://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Skycube), a small board with an PIC16F876A micro-controller designed with the open-source Kicad EDA tool.  \n\nThe following things previously designed and uploaded to thingiverse have been used:  \n\n* Servo wheels: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4767  \n* Parameterized battery pack: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5079  \n\nThe Chassis is an evolution of the proof of concept minimal chassis:  \n\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4954  \n\nWe want to thank to all our students who are testing and improving this robot. Special thanks to Olalla Bravo ( http://www.thingiverse.com/Olalla ) for the design of the Castor wheel.  \n\nThis preliminary work will be presented soon at the 6th International Symposium on Autonomous Minirobots for Research and Edutainment ( http://www.amiresymposia.org/amire2011/ )  \n\n**UPDATE 2011/May/28**  \nThe paper and slides about the MiniSkybot, presented at the Amire 2011 conference can be found at http://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Paper:2011-Amire-Miniskybot  \n\nVideo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSO1v0a-HO8  \n\n**UPDATE 2011/Jun/23**  \nA new video of CW Kreimer explaining and showing his Miniskybot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EqvuPXYKf0  \n\n**UPDATE 2011/Dec/05**  \nThe new skymega board (Arduino compatible) is now being using for controlling the robot:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14197  \n\n**UPDATE 2013/March/18**   \nNew Miniskybot 2: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:63165"
