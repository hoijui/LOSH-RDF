function = "IMPORTANT NOTE: This will not work on a Prusa i3 or really anything that is complete and available.  I think the design is pretty cool, but you'd need to build a machine around it.  \n\nThis is combined carriage and extruder for 70mm spaced vertical x-axis.  It uses 4 lm8uu bearings and can be removed from the machine without tools or disassembly of the x-axis.  With the idler open the hobbed bolt and gear can be removed and cleaned without tools. I've done an extruder test and it rides nicely on the rails, but i wont be able to print anything with it until i build the rest of the machine.   \nX-ends available here:  \nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18539"
