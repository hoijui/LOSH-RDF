function = "This is a two piece spinner for a Howard DGA-3 Pete RC airplane. Thought it will work on any 200w range motor with a .25in shaft diameter prop adapter. It's designed around a Master Airscrew 6x4 prop. It's held together by two M3x8mm socket head cap screws.\r\n\r\nI am planning on fiddling with the thickness to get the weight down. I will also play with cooling holes. Stay tuned."
