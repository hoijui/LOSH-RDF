function = "This is an alternate ESC/BEC mounting plate for a Century Swift NX 550 electric heli. It's made specifically for a HobbyWing 80A HW ESC. The HobbyWing ESC won't fit in the normal place for the ESC and there isn't a clean way to attach it. This provides for bolting the ESC to the Heli with real screws and captive hex nuts. It has a pretty big space for BEC so you can use what ever you want."
