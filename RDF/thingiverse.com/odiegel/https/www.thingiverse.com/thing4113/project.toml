function = "This is a little screw cap that you can print on your UP Printer and then glue onto the heads of the screws that hold the print platform to the heater base. This allows you to easily remove the print platform without needing the Allen key. I use epoxy to glue them onto the screws andput it in a little vice until the epoxy dries."
