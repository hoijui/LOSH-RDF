function = "This Thingi was compelling to export to .stl from .blend. There were many disableing factors but indeed after five hours of export alter export I finally got it printable. It made me happy, well except that it took over two hours to print. But it looks good. There is still more learning to be had from this file so I shall now post it for anyone to experiment with. \r\n\r\nThe single STL file(horse1.stl) is all that is needed to print this Thingi but I will post the blend also just in case."
