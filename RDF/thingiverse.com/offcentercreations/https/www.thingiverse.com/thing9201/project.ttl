It made me happy, well except that it took over two hours to print. But it looks good. There is still more learning to be had from this file so I shall now post it for anyone to experiment with. \r
\r
The single STL file(horse1.stl) is all that is needed to print this Thingi but I will post the blend also just in case.""" ;
