\r
This is a 3D printable one-piece watch band that is strong, functional and light. It fits watches that have a 22mm lug width, and a lug to lug distance of 46.2mm (I designed it to fit a Seiko SNDA65 watch).\r
If enough people are interested, I can design a few more sizes, and size the lug to lug distance for various watches! \r
\r
I posted the design process for this watch band on my blog: http://colin-ho.com/3d-printed-watch-band/""" ;
