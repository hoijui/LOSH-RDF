function: "Why would you just tell the time, when you could tell the time from a watch on a 3D printed watch band!\r\n\r\nThis is a 3D printable one-piece watch band that is strong, functional and light. It fits watches that have a 22mm lug width, and a lug to lug distance of 46.2mm (I designed it to fit a Seiko SNDA65 watch).\r\nIf enough people are interested, I can design a few more sizes, and size the lug to lug distance for various watches! \r\n\r\nI posted the design process for this watch band on my blog: http://colin-ho.com/3d-printed-watch-band/"
