function = "This is a Fibonacci striped watch band for sporting your watch with mathematical style!\r\n\r\nIt fits watches that have a 22mm lug width, and a lug to lug distance of 46.2mm (I designed it to fit a Seiko SNDA65 watch). It fits a wrist size of up to ~180mm\r\n\r\nI took the same watch band design and made it striped! The number of layers in each stripe corresponds with the fibonacci sequence (1-1-2-3-5-8-13... and so on) \r\n\r\nMy blog post about the design: http://colin-ho.com/3d-printed-fibonacci-watch-band/"
