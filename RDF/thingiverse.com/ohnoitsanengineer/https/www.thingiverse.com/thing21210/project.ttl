    okh:function """This is a quick design I drew up for a Prusa X-carriage. It's fairly thin, and should have all the proper mounting holes for most "Standard" extruders (gregs/wades/etc). Originally I made this to work with my non-standard extruder, so I modified the files to allow for standard mounting, so that others can use it. For added stiffness, there's four #8 socket head cap screw counterbores, for attaching a stiff plate on the bottom, or a fan, or whatever you want.\r
\r
Designed in Solidworks 2010, and CAD files are attached.""" ;
