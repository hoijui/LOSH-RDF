function = "The amazing paste extruder with screw holes added for the printrbot x-carrage. I also removed the ball bearing indentations as i didn't think they were nessary.  \n\nOH YES! Sorry i completely forgot i uploaded this. The piece i printed didn't work properly, although that could be partly due to the quality of my printer and parts, and the fact I didn't have a proper belt. If you're looking to build this you're better off making the original. SORRY FOR ANY WASTED FILAMENT! :(  \n\nI'll leave this up for reference if anyone's looking for measurements for printrbot mounts or whatnot."
