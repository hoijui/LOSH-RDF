OH YES! Sorry i completely forgot i uploaded this. The piece i printed didn't work properly, although that could be partly due to the quality of my printer and parts, and the fact I didn't have a proper belt. If you're looking to build this you're better off making the original. SORRY FOR ANY WASTED FILAMENT! :(  

I'll leave this up for reference if anyone's looking for measurements for printrbot mounts or whatnot.""" ;
