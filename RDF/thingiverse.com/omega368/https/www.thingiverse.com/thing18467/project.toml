function = "A thing modified from the standard Prusa bar clamp for mounting electronics boards, power supply, and anything else you see fit. \r\n\r\nI have seen various designs to mount the RAMPS/GEN6 boards/power supply to the Prusa frame, however I feel those take up much time to print. \r\n\r\nI wanted to find another way to mount my power supply so I modified the standard rod clamp with a M3 hole. I discovered that this small unassuming mod also came in handy for mounting a GEN6 board too."
