function = "A while back the battery cover to my NXT got lost in a tub of bricks and hasn't been seen since. The missing cover never really bugged me until recently. Instead of trying to buy the part, I decided to print one! \r\n\r\nAs it stands now, this is just a battery cover. But if it is added to something else, it may make the large flat surface on the back of the NXT even more useful. If not, this part will live out it's life as a battery cover.\r\n\r\nNote: This was designed for the NXT 1.0. It may or may not work for the NXT 2.0."
