function: "Wild, sure. Wacky, check. A little nuts, most definitely! You may seen the products that allow you to attach your SLR lenses to your iPhone, but why settle for that when you can mount your whole SLR on your iPhone!  \nNow when your friend shows up with a SLR lens on their iPhone, you can pull out your iPhone with SLR attached.
