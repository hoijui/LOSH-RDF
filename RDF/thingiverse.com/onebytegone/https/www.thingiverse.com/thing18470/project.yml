function: "Have you ever been watching your favorite movie or TV show on an iPhone and had someone walk up and rudely interrupt it? With Rabbit Ears for iPhone, that will be a thing of the past!\r\n\r\nBy printing a pair of these out and placing them your iPhone, you can make it clear to people that you are watching a video. In a way these almost suggest to them that 'This is not the person your are looking for, move along'."
