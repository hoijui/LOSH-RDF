function: "Want a case for your iPhone that is the epitome of odd? Now you can print your own case that is the true definition of odd! (At least in the mathematical sense)\r\n\r\nIn the field of mathematics an odd integer is defined as being equal to 2k+1; k\xE2\u02C6\u02C6\xE2\u201E\xA4. In words that the rest of us can understand, an integer is odd if it is equal to some integer multiplied by 2 and had an 1 added to it. The \"k\xE2\u02C6\u02C6\xE2\u201E\xA4\" part means that \"k\" is an element(\xE2\u02C6\u02C6) of the set of all integers(\xE2\u201E\xA4). The formula on this printed case is the set of all odd integers (e.g. -3, -1, 1, 3), this is denoted by the upside down A (\xE2\u02C6\u20AC) meaning that for all k where k is an integer, the number that is equal to 2k+1 is odd.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a side note, the development of this case can be written as a nice set of implication statements:\r\nWhen you take discrete math, you become confused. When you become confused, you are not sure of the actual definition of things. When you are not sure of the actual definition of things, you start making strange puns. When you start making strange puns, you design iPhone cases like this. Therefore, unless you want to start making strange puns, don't take discrete math.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, if you are still reading this, just think, you will have the oddest iPhone case around! So odd, you may not even know what it means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks stuartpb to for Spiff Sans: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13347"
