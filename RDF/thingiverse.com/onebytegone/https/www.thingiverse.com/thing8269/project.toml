function = "Have you ever wanted to watch your MakerBot print while you are away? Perhaps setup a live feed of your MakerBot? Or just want to add a webcam to your MakerBot? Then this will hopefully help you out.\r\n\r\nThe MakerBot Webcam Attachment (It needs a better name) is a printable mount that attaches your webcam to a printable arm which connects to the frame of your MakerBot. By setting up a VNC server on the computer controlling your MakerBot and attaching the webcam, you will then be able to control and watch your MakerBot from any computer in the world with internet access! Also, you could setup a web sever on that computer and host a live stream of what is print on your MakerBot. \r\n\r\nNow the question is, Is this a MakerCam or do you have a WebBot?\r\nIf anyone has questions about setting up a web server or a VNC server, I'll do my best to answer them.\r\n\r\nThis is sized for a Microsoft LifeCam HD-5000 [ http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/lifecam-hd-5000/7ND-00001 ], but can easily be modified for a different camera with the included SCAD file.\r\n\r\nThe last image is a sample taken from the webcam.\r\n\r\nWARNING: As barrychuck brought out, running a MakerBot while unattended is very dangerous. I am not responsible for any damage or harm that occurs from use of this part. Use this at your own risk!"
