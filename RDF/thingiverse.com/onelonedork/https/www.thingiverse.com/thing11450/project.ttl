    okh:function """I'm the proud owner of both the Thingomatic and a CupeCake 3d printers. I've been wanting a larger build area for awhile and it seems like a Reprap Mendel is one of my best options. \r
\r
After looking over all of the Mendel designs out there, I thought it might be nice to bring some of the T-slot style construction to Mendal style hardware. \r
\r
I spent this weekend working with my FireBall V90 CNC Router to come up with a basic concept and I've decided to go with a upside down T style design. I ordered a set of linear bearings from kclinear.com and I should have a full frame design put together in a few more weeks. \r
\r
Tell then this is a work in progress.  \r
\r
Update: Just added the upright frame parts and build platform spacers. I designed this with 6 screw mounts on either side of the frame. I'm now starting to work on motor mounts and Z slider brackets. \r
\r
Update 9/16/11: Added Top motor mount plate and some support peaces. It's coming together well. \r
\r
Update 9/16/11:Z and X stage mounts add. Two holes on either side of Z bearings left for lead screw mount. The current design is for use with a traditional mendel Z rod for vertical motion. I might make a few modifications so that this could be used with the motors used on http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10103. I like the idea of being able to use the same settings on this as I use on my TOM.""" ;
