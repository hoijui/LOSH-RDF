    okh:function "I used this as a flexible coupler on a NEMA23 motor with 1/4\" shaft to a 1/4\" screw shaft.  I had originally purchased some rigid shaft couplers but, they were transmitting way to much vibration that resulted in excessive noise.  These couplers have considerably dampened the noise and appear to be strong enough.  I haven't done extensive testing so I can't say what the longevity of these will be.  I also had a design constraint of no longer than 25mm so the dimensions are 25mm long, 26mm width and height." ;
