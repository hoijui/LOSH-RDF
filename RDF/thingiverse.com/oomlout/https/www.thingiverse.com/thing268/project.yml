function: "A desktop machine that will measure out a length of wire and strip a length from either end.\r\n(a video of it in operation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2O7kGE34EA ) \r\n\r\n Why? \r\nTo create lengths of wire that fit perfectly into an electronics breadboard. (we produce kits and you can only hand cut and strip so many wires before you go crazy)\r\n\r\nThis is also the first item in a concept oomlout.com is working on dubbed \"open manufacturing\". (more to follow)\r\n\r\n How?\r\nIt breaks down into three parts\r\n1. Wire Feeder - This feeds the wire in measured lengths forwards and backwards (uses a stepper motor)\r\n2. Wire Stripper - This runs an exacto knife blade around the insulation of the wire twice. (uses a small servo motor and normal sized servo motor)\r\n3. Wire Snipper - Snips the wire at the end. (uses a pair of wire cutters and a cheap handheld drill motor)"
