Addressed it has become, and if you too have a few stepper motors, a hand-held wire stripper and a bunch of nuts and bolts your life, too, can become easier.\r\n\r\nFor all of you crying overkill, we do have a small ulterior motive, at oomlout.com we manufacture a number of kits that come with pre-stripped wires hence the need for semi automation. This version is the much improved brethren of version one.\r\n\r\nLet's get to stripping.
