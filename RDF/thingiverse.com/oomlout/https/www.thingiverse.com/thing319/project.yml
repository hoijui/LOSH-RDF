function: "When you're building circuits on a breadboard there is nothing more annoying than having to measure, snip, and then strip both ends of each and every piece of wire.\r\n\r\nWell perhaps there are greater annoyances but that does not mean that this problem should go un-addressed. Addressed it has become, and if you too have a few stepper motors, a hand-held wire stripper and a bunch of nuts and bolts your life, too, can become easier.\r\n\r\nFor all of you crying overkill, we do have a small ulterior motive, at oomlout.com we manufacture a number of kits that come with pre-stripped wires hence the need for semi automation. This version is the much improved brethren of version one.\r\n\r\nLet's get to stripping. (that doesn't sound quite right)\r\n\r\nA video of it in action;\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fftZq_deIls\r\n\r\nA second video (a little shaky but better at showing the different components)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWS99SeBHX8"
