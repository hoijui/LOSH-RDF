function: "A Chair with a bit of a back story.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of putting off our real work around oomlout we set ourselves a simple challenge, make a chair. What ensued a day (well we're a bit disappointed as it took closer to half a day but we digress) where we went from figuring out what size a chair should be through computer drawings, cnc cutting and finally assembly.\r\n\r\n(shameless plug)\r\nIf you'd like all the details they can be found on our blog:\r\nhttp://www.oomlout.com/blog/"
