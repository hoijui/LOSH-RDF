function = "In honour of Thingiverse Thursday here's a design that has been sitting on our hard drive for a little while.\r\n\r\nIts a simple little box that makes wiring up an 8 x 8 LED Matrix easy. It uses the MAX7219 (or 7221) LED driver chip from Maxim and uses the Matrix library in the Arduino library.\r\n\r\nFor Details on how to wire up and program try:\r\nhttp://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/MAX72XXHardware\r\n\r\nA small video of it scrolling a Valentines day message:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/snazzyguy/3277618701"
