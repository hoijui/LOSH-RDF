function: "While we have lots of problems at oomlout HQ many of them are a bit too complex to solve so we find ourselves dealing with the smaller ones. Today we tackled the proliferation of mugs in our kitchen (growth can be difficult).\r\n\r\nWe scoured our local thrift shops for weeks but sadly no mug trees, so we bit the bullet. The result a lovely usefully mug tree made from MDF with only two unique parts. Hope it can help other peoples kitchens feel as organized as ours."
