function = "The Clonedel RepStrap was inspired by the Prusa Mendel (see the related article).  \r\n\r\nhttp://open3dp.me.washington.edu/2011/02/prusa-mendel-and-the-clonedels/\r\n\r\nIt came about due to necessity of students wanting to build RepRap style machines faster than we could 3D print them. It took about a week outside of class to redesign Prusa parts for mold production.  Most of the parts required only minor modifications, but several parts, such as the X-Carriage assembly, required redesign.  All modified parts were placed on mold pattern plates to allow for the production of silicone RTV molds.   \r\n\r\nAll of the STL files are now posted here and on GitHub as an Open3DP fork off of the Prusa tree.  \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open3dp/PrusaMendel/downloads\r\n\r\nThey are to be considered Alpha release (and we are already working on some changes).   However, we am quite sure that you will be able to use them to print master forms to produce molds (because we have produced molds and we have used the molds to produce RepRaps).\r\n\r\nThese mold plates represent the current best practice as provided by reprap project, prusa mendel, jnfisher, whosawhatis, rustyspoon1121, etc.\r\n\r\nFurther, Metrix Create Space has already created molds sets and cast parts.  Metrix Create is already making them available.\r\n\r\nhttp://metrixcreatespace.com/post/3587952561/clone-factory-bootstrapping\r\n\r\n{P.S. Several people have had trouble with EndStops and XMotor. I uploaded them to NetFabb Beta to fix them. I have uploaded _Fixed versions. Please let me know if these files are better.}"
