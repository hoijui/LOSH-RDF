function = "These are drop in replacement tiles for the famous scrabble game by Parker Brothers.  What these tiles provide is a hexadecimal set of characters, with point values corresponding to their numeric values.  This should provide for truly universal language support in scrabble.  Any player can feel free to deploy their words now as they would in any other version of scrabble, only now they have their choice of encoding types.  Including full unicode support!"
