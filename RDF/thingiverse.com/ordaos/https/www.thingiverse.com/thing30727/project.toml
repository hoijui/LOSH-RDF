function = "Somewhat parametric, kinematic mirror/lens mount for steering optics.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_mount\r\n\r\nIt contains a living hinge in one corner and two magnets in the adjacent corners. These magnets are attracted to a pair of set screws used to adjust the mirror angle. The size of the magnets match those in the makerbot platform.\r\n\r\nThere are both imperial and metric mounting versions. Imperial uses a 1/4\" hole, while metric uses a 6mm hole to match the optical benches. Alternatively if you need a cheap optical rail you can use T-slot extrusion like I did in the photos."
