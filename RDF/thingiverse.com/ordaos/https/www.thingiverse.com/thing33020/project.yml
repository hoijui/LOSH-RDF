function: "This thing is a Michelson interferometer,\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson_interferometer\r\n\r\nIt can be used to measure relative motion with nanometer precision and accuracy. This is done by counting interference fringes generated by the constructive and destructive interference of coherent light. A transition from constructive to destructive interference corresponds to a movement of half the wavelength of the light used. \r\n\r\nIt consists of a laser holder, laser, a beam splitter, two mirrors, a diffusing lens an optional photodetector and the framework for fixing the position of all the parts.\r\n\r\nGood luck implementing it as a position feedback system on your 3D printer ;-)\r\n\r\nIt's mostly based off of a kinematic mirror mount http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30727\r\n\r\nVideo demonstrations:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/IsIFKxLLVd0\r\nhttp://youtu.be/0OLO-GWjg9E\r\n\r\nThere are two images include that show the interferometer mounted vertically. These were an attempt at making a load-displacement testing tool. Unfortunately the vibration in the linear actuator was too great, making displacement measurements erroneous.\r\n\r\nNext step is to mount a piezo buzzer behind one of the mirrors to determine its stroke."
