function: "This is the surface generated by a sinc function (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_function). It was inspired by some of the other work done on knots, specifically emmett who was using matlab.\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD file contains the matlab code to generate the surface which was then imported into openSCAD. openSCAD offers a very simple method for turning height data into an object."
