function = "I loved zerocool5878's modified AO Z Upper end.  I found while using them, however, that one of my Z rods was not quite plumb.  Fixing that involved carfully chiseling away part of the piece.  This is a modified version that allows the mount to be slid to adjust plumb.  To preserve the rigidity that I loved from the original, I added a diagonal brace as well as portions that slide into the aluminum extrusions.  I am using the modified versions on my Mendelmax printer."
