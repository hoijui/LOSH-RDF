function = "A Pirate Party coin that works in shopping trolleys as a 50 â‚¬uro cent replacement. This version has reliefs on both sides. You can use the OpenSCAD script to make your own in different sizes and shapes. If you print with support material, you obviously won't be able to break it away but it still looks nice with differnt fill patterns."
