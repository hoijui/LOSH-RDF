function = "Case for the iphone 5.  Modeled using the official dimensions published by apple.  I liked the design of this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5473, but it had really annoying features, which were difficult to print, so I built this from scratch.  And this case has simple features, making it easy to print on a reprap.  I'm printing right now.  I'll post pics when it's done.  And after my iphone5 shows up, I'll verify the fit and post updated files if it needs changing.  \r\n\r\nI did make use of the iphone5 mockup while modeling, just to have something to look at and compare."
