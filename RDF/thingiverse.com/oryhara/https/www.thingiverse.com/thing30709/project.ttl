    okh:function """Case for the iphone 5.  Modeled using the official dimensions published by apple.  I liked the design of this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5473, but it had really annoying features, which were difficult to print, so I built this from scratch.  And this case has simple features, making it easy to print on a reprap.  I'm printing right now.  I'll post pics when it's done.  And after my iphone5 shows up, I'll verify the fit and post updated files if it needs changing.  \r

I did make use of the iphone5 mockup while modeling, just to have something to look at and compare.""" ;
