function: iPhone5 case with 5mm on all sides.  My previous iphone5 case was 8mm, which is rather bulky, but fit in my hands nicely.  the case i liked for my iphone4 was about 4.5mm, which was nice and solid, but interfered with the flash.  This case does not.  It also has more clearance for the front camera and ambient light sensor.
