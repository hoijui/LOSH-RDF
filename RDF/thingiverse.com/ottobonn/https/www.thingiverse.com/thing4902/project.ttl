\r
Use this bracket to mount the Omniwheel to any flat surface. You can choose between two versions:\r
\r
Bracket-Solid has a solid base for drilling and mounting with bolts, or velcro, etc.\r
\r
Bracket-Cutout is the same except the base is "cut out" such that it is gluable and uses less plastic. See the pictures for clarification.""" ;
