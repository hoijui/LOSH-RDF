function: "This bracket holds one 36mm Omniwheel by cbiffle (thing #705, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:705). It is printable in one build on a 3D Printer and uses the same (3mm) metal rod that the Omniwheel needs.\r\n\r\nUse this bracket to mount the Omniwheel to any flat surface. You can choose between two versions:\r\n\r\nBracket-Solid has a solid base for drilling and mounting with bolts, or velcro, etc.\r\n\r\nBracket-Cutout is the same except the base is \"cut out\" such that it is gluable and uses less plastic. See the pictures for clarification."
