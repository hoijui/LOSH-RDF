function = "Two discrete parts. One to hold a wider variety of spools, and another to act as the guide for the filament for the PP3DP UP! Plus printer.\r\nThe spool holder that comes with the printer only takes the narrow spools that PP3DP sells.\r\nThe spool holder I've created will allow for a 100mm wide spool and 250mm diameter spool to fit on the printer.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the spool holder gets replaced, a new filament guide was needed.\r\nBoth parts are heavy duty, and should last."
