\r
But if you happen to posses a double X chromosome configuration it is highly unlikely you will ever grow a full blown moustache.\r
But do not worry! This moustaches can be clamped to a bottle of your favourite softdrink or beer and give you instant manliness.\r
\r
Remember: With great mustache comes great responsibility.\r

\r
I found a picture of a similar design on the internets and made this svg myself.\r
As I dont know who had the idea for the original design i was not able to contact the original designer. If you find out let me know =)""" ;
