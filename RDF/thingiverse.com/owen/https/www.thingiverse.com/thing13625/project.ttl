\r
\r
\r
Oct. 16 2012: I've put a new one up now which is wider and puts out more air. Also necessary for the V2 nozzle. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32491  \r
\r
\r
\r
Dec. 9 2011: Put another version up with about 1.5mm more clearance from hot parts.  \r
\r
\r
\r
Nov. 22 2011: Added bracing and thicker mounting strip to support the fan better. Removed some plastic from the side so that the Nozzle at the back stl would not hit the z stage at the back. Provided stl for nozzle at the back fitting.  \r
\r
\r
\r
*******  \r
\r
\r
\r
Provides air from the supplied fan to the filament and surrounds and mainly avoids the heater tip.  \r
\r
Max air by getting mounting bolt out of the way and facing more direct.  \r
\r
3mm clearance to hot things and platform.  \r
\r
I have trialled similar one at 2 to 2.5mm for a while but I do print at fairly low temps.""" ;
