function = "Specifically made for the Ultimaker but could be used anywhere. The normal hex driver you get has the handle at the same height as the top of the Ultimaker when adjusting the platfrom which makes it hard to get a straight angle on it and get the hot end close as well. This is long and thin which helps all of the above. The grip also slides up and down so that you can avoid putting weight on the platform while you are adjusting it."
