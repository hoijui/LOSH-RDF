function = "This delivers more air than my previous fan duct.  \nSuitable for V2 Nozzle.  \nClearance is 3mm to platform and 2.5mm to heater block.  \nMay be suitable for dual extruders (Untried yet)  \nPush on and Nut Mounted variety.  \nUpdated Both Fan Ducts May 16/2013 (better wall thickness. Firmer fit for Push on Duct. Old one started slipping after a bit of use)  \nSee http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:77107 for what looks to be a good improvement to my push on Duct."
