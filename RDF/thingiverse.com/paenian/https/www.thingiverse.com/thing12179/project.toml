function = "Info on the tags here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee804885%28v=surface.10%29.aspx\r\n\r\nParametric surface tag generation.  The tags need to be 3/4\" square, but you can set the byte number, border, back, corners, etc.\r\n\r\nTested working on the 1.0 version of the surface.  If they're not recognized as tags, take a surface picture - you need to get the dot/non-dot contrast to be pretty high.\r\n\r\nThese need to be printed in UV-reflective filament - the clear doesn't work.  Also, the height makes a big difference - if they're too short you get too much background reflection from inside the tag.  I colored the insides in with black marker."
