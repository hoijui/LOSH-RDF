function: "Climbing hold for indoor rock climbing.  Accepts a 3/8\" bolt.\r\n\r\nThe openscad puts random spheres (with random offset and number of facets) around a central cube to ensure a good attachment point.  Play with the seed, add more spheres, go nuts!\r\n\r\nTested on a bouldering wall, SportRock in Sterling VA.  I think it'd be better to enlarge it, but of course I was worried about strength.  The size that it is, you can't really crank on it so it's stable, if a bit slippery."
