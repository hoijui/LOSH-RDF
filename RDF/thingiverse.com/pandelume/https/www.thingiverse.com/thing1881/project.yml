function: "A set of Cupcake CNC X-stage DXFs converted for cutting on a CNC router with a 3mm (or possibly 1/8\\\") bit.  Slots have also been resized for 5.2mm plywood.\r\n\r\nA couple of things to note:\r\n\r\n1) There are a couple of places on the stage and front that will need corner cleanup with a file to remove the radius left while cutting.\r\n2) The lasercut slots for engaging the timing belt obviously can\\'t be cut with a 3mm bit.  My solution was to recess the area of the slots so that a short section of timing belt can be glued in, but if anyone can think of a better solution I\\'d be happy to hear it.  I have included an STL file of the rib.\r\n3)  Some of these parts are pretty delicate, so caution is advised.\r\n\r\nRelated things:\r\nRouterized Cupcake body panels: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1864\r\nRouterized Cupcake Y and Z stages: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1882"
