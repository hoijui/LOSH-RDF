function = "DXFs of the Cupcake CNC y-stage and z platform modified for cutting on a CNC router with a 3mm bit.  Slots have been resized for 5.2mm plywood.\r\n\r\nA couple of notes:\r\n\r\n1) Holes for the magnets are round, but should still be a tight fit on the corners of the magnets.  I don't think this will be enough, so I'd recommend using epoxy glue or something similar to fill the gaps.\r\n2) Like the x-rib, instead of a series of slots for timing belt engagement the y-rib has a recess for permanently gluing a short length of timing belt.  I've included a STL file for this part - if anyone thinks of a better way of doing this, please let me know.\r\n3) some of these parts are small and delicate, so take care while cutting.  I haven't tried it yet, but I will as soon as I have the chance.\r\n\r\nRelated things:\r\nRouterized Cupcake body panels: thingiverse.com/thing:1864\r\nRouterized Cupcake X stage: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1881"
