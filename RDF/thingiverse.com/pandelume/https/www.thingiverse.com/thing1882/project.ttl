    okh:function """DXFs of the Cupcake CNC y-stage and z platform modified for cutting on a CNC router with a 3mm bit.  Slots have been resized for 5.2mm plywood.\r
\r
A couple of notes:\r
\r
1) Holes for the magnets are round, but should still be a tight fit on the corners of the magnets.  I don't think this will be enough, so I'd recommend using epoxy glue or something similar to fill the gaps.\r
2) Like the x-rib, instead of a series of slots for timing belt engagement the y-rib has a recess for permanently gluing a short length of timing belt.  I've included a STL file for this part - if anyone thinks of a better way of doing this, please let me know.\r
3) some of these parts are small and delicate, so take care while cutting.  I haven't tried it yet, but I will as soon as I have the chance.\r
