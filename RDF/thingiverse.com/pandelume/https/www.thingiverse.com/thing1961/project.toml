function = "Whether on a distant planet, a dystopian wasteland, or your own back yard, fortune can be yours with this 3D printable gold pan!  Comes in in two sizes: 4in dia (mini), and 8in dia (medium), and with or without riffles.  Can also double as a change dish or emergency dinner plate.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1) These are fairly large, so a heated build platform might help prevent warping.\r\n2) The outer overhang is 45 degrees, so it should print without support, but I haven\\\\\\'t tested it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone produces any gold with these, please post pictures."
