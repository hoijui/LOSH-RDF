function = "This is an experimental set of printable machine parts, the idea being that you can configure these into whatever 3-or-fewer-axis machine you want.  The basic parts are:\r\n\r\n1) Linear rail and ball carriage.\r\n2) Rack and pinion\r\n3) Structural blocks with 2 (angle), 3, 4, and 5 mating faces.\r\n\r\nHole patterns for all parts are NEMA 17 - 31mm square, and holes are sized for M4 fasteners.\r\n\r\nWith the right tool holders it should be possible to make a small milling machine, drilling machine, maybe a pick-and-place machine, who knows?  I invite people to please post suggestions or modifications.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1) I haven't printed any of these yet, but I have skeinforged them, so I think they'll print ok.\r\n2) I haven't arranged multiple parts into one file so they can be printed together, but it would be smart to do this.  I'll post assembled files when I get a chance.\r\n3) I don't know how accurate the resulting machine will be, so please keep in mind that this is still something of a work in progress.  I hope to add and anti-backlash split gear as a start, but I'd love to hear other suggestions."
