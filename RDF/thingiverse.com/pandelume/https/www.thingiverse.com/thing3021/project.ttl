    okh:function """This is a 25mm x 50mm printable scale to be used in the construction of ABS scale mail.  Perhaps you've always wished that your precious skin were a little more puncture-resistant; if so, this is the thing for you! Just print as many scales as necessary and sew them to your undershirt, and you can walk the dark streets with confidence.  May also be useful if you're a costumed crime fighter or are making a fancy halloween costume.\r

EDITED TO ADD:\r
\r
Based on comments, I have uploaded DXFs and some additional scale types.  I have also uploaded a printable rivet that can be used to assemble the printed or lasercut lamellar plates (scale mail will still need to be sewn to a backing).  IT's an interferance fit on the end, but it should tap in with a hammer; once it's in there should be a fair bit of compliance, but the diameter and length of the rivet may need to be tweaked.""" ;
