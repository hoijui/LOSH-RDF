function = "This is an XY table for a desktop dremel-powered vertical mill.  The rest of the assembly isn't completed yet, but I after seeing NickAmes' work ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2956 ), I figured I should post this and see if it might be useful to his project.  I still plan on finishing this when I get a chance, but collaboration can't hurt.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea here is that the X and Y stages are the same part and can be assembled into as long a stage as you like.  X and Y stages are held together by a pair of M3 all-thread rods which are tightened by nuts on each end to place the stage in compression.  each slide has a captured M6 nut which engages an M6 all-thread rod with a handle something like this:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2086\r\n\r\nThe slides are keyed together with 3mm keys (not yet modeled) and fastened by 4-8 M3 SHCS.  The whole affair is attached to the table or bench by screws through the Y-axis endcaps.  T-nuts (not yet modeled) would have a captive nut so that parts can be secured to the x-stage.  As-is it might suffice as an XY table for an existing drill press, if you have one.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n1) These may have to be walked through blender before they can be skeinforged."
