function = "This is a spin-off of the Wobble Arrester by twotimes:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2151\r\nI love his idea, but I had a hard time getting the offset linear guides to work properly - my prints always had a sort of blobby section right at the top, which took my bushings out of alignment and caused binding.  No doubt I still need to work on my skeinforge skills.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I figured that ideally the Z-rods should be somewhere in the middle of the Z-stage - in other words, between the drive screws.  This should reduce binding and in the event of a crash won't load the Z-rods and bushing clamps as badly.  It also turns out that there's space enough to add the standard makerbot rod mounting scheme: through holes with external covers, although the covers are a little different due to space constraints.  I have uploaded DXFs that can be used as templates for modifying your top, middle, and Z-stage; if you have access to a lasercutter you could use them to cut drop-in replacements to the standard makerbot parts.\r\n\r\nI certainly don't want to step on any toes, but I'd like to see Z-rods as a standard option, so I tried to make this mounting arrangement easy to implement on the production side.  Unfortunately I couldn\\'t find a stock part for the bearing mount, but it should be easy to machine in quantity if it comes to that.\r\n\r\nThe bearing retainer comes in 3 flavors: 3/8\" through hole for use with bearing inserts, 1/4\" through hole for use without bearings, and 3/8\" without counterbore for printing.  (Note that if you intend on printing you'll have to use a non-headed bushing or relieve the underside of the Z-stage to accommodate the bushing head.)  Just choose your poison.\r\n\r\nEDITED TO ADD:\r\nI noticed an error in the modified Z-stage DXF, so I have removed the old file and uploaded a corrected one.  The first version would still work fine as a template to modify an existing stage, but not for cutting a new one.  Please download the updated version."
