\r
Basically, this is a direct adaptation of the unicorn assembly - all I did was break it down into a small number of printable parts.  Pretty straightforward, and should go together pretty easily.  One thing I changed was the extruder controller mount, figuring that it's better to use a separate mount like http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4174\r
\r
Now if only you could have the pen plotter and the extruder integrated so that you only need one controller and wouldn't need to swap toolheads. Hmmmmmmmm...""" ;
