function: "This is a derivative of Makerbot's Unicorn Pen Plotter ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4185 )\r\n\r\nBasically, this is a direct adaptation of the unicorn assembly - all I did was break it down into a small number of printable parts.

One thing I changed was the extruder controller mount, figuring that it's better to use a separate mount like http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4174\r\n\r\nNow if only you could have the pen plotter and the extruder integrated so that you only need one controller and wouldn't need to swap toolheads. Hmmmmmmmm..."
