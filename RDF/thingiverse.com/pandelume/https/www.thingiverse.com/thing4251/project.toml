function = "If you\\'re like me, you were smitten with envy when the Thing-o-matic was announced; if you\\'re even more like me, you can\\'t really afford it (yet).  I designed this as a way to retrofit some of the new functionality into the cupcake - specifically the faster, lead-screw based Z-movement and Z-shafting to improve print quality.  With any luck, this mod and the 4th generation electronics will bring the cupcake into the same class of build quality as the Thing-o-matic, if in a reduced build size/poor cousin kind of way.  And I really mean reduced build size - this Z-stage cuts about 45mm off the available height, so be warned.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n1) I specified a 1/4\\\"-16 acme screw, 152.5mm in length.  The length will depend on exactly how you mount the screw and coupler on your motor.  I think the Thing-o-matic uses 1/4\\\"-20 precision acme screw, but I wasn\\'t able to find a cheap hex nut for that, and all the flanged nuts I found were pricey and needed machining for a bolt pattern.  Consequently, I went for the 1/4\\\"-16, but once Makerbot releases the documentation maybe it can be switched.  It would be best to use whatever they\\'re using.  The length will also be shorter if you're using either a HBP or conveyor.\r\n2) For this to work your extruder has to be mounted 180 degrees from the stock configuration - in other words, with the motor in front.\r\n\r\nEDITED TO ADD:\r\nVersion 2 of this thing is here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4259\r\n\r\nI've also uploaded modified top and middle profiles with dedicated .25\" holes for the Z-rods, for those hardcore cupcakers who want a fully lasercut setup.\r\n\r\nI've also uploaded a printable Z-motor spacer block and shaft coupler."
