    okh:function """This is a second version of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4251 - the Thing-o-Matic inspired cupcake Z-stage.  This version sacrifices potential Z-stage stiffness for build height.  I'm not sure how well it'll work, since the original cupcake Z-stage had the drive screws double as supports, so there wasn't ever much bending force (apart from gravity) applied to the stage.  On the other hand it might work just great since the load isn't very large.\r
\r
EDITED TO ADD:\r
I've also uploaded modified top and middle profiles with dedicated .25" holes for the Z-rods, for those hardcore cupcakers who want a fully lasercut setup.\r
\r
I've also uploaded a printable Z-motor spacer block and shaft coupler to give more z-movement.""" ;
