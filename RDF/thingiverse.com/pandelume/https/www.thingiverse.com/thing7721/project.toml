function = "Here's the deal: I've been reading a book called \"Cadillac Desert\" - a good book, but not relevant to this Thing except that it brought to mind the word \"cadillac\".  I've also been working on this:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7641\r\nwhich is based on the cupcake platform, and cadillac + cupcake leads inevitably to cupcake tailfins.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, at least, the mysterious process of inspiration has been documented.  Anyhow, I'm also working on a version of this with integrated 5mm LEDs in the place of taillights - probably with a battery.  More on that later; probably after I put more work into the x-gantry."
