http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7641\r
which is based on the cupcake platform, and cadillac + cupcake leads inevitably to cupcake tailfins.\r
\r
In this instance, at least, the mysterious process of inspiration has been documented.  Anyhow, I'm also working on a version of this with integrated 5mm LEDs in the place of taillights - probably with a battery.  More on that later; probably after I put more work into the x-gantry.""" ;
