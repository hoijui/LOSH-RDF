function = "This very simple tiny Thing allows a quick and very precise calibration.\r\n\r\nThis innovative approach consists in:\r\n- FIXING the endstop once and forever to the printer structure.\r\n- Doing the calibration by means of a small and accurate M2 screw (0.4 mm per  turn) mounted on the part that moves towards the endstop.\r\n- Enjoying NO PLAY/slack.\r\n\r\nSample application - Prusa i3 Z-axis endstop (see pictures):\r\n- Z-Endstop fixed to the metal frame.\r\n- Thing holding the M2 screw fixed to the bottom of the right X-end.\r\n\r\nNote: I have removed the metal lever from the endstop, leaving just the button; this improves the accuracy."
