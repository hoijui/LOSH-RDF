function: "This is a simple BIC pen holder for the Ultimaker. Trying to make a plotter out of it (actually i did this to help test for backlash). It was done in Freecad (my first piece) and the source file is included if anyone wants to change it. \r\n\r\nAfter printing them I noticed that the pen holder should be more on the corner so that the pen would not collide with the right side of the ultimaker. Since this is mostly for test purposes I don't think I'll change it further."
