function = "Four bats dangling on a thin threads, creating nice shadows on the wall. The design was inspired by the images made for the unicorn plotter recently on thingiverse. For this bat mobile the same tricks are used to convert a picture into a single line as in the plotter images, but in this case the image is drawn using plastic (PLA/ABS). A total of 5 layers on top of each other gives some strength but leaves a very light object which creates nice shadows. See a very short movie here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skxY-EhkV6c"
