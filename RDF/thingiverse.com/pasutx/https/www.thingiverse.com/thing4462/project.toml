function = "In the Bat Mobile (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4453) I used a 2D image, converted to a single line which was meant to be drawn by the unicorn pen plotter. I did not plot the image, but printed the image in plastic with 3-5 layers to give it some strength. It is possible to print images like that directly on paper which gives a nice effect for postcards.\r\nAttached a picture of an example how a thin plastic image is printed on a postcard."
