function = "This is a bracelet generator. The bracelet is made of loose square rings linking to the rings next to them in the style of chainmail. Using the customizer you can define the lenght and width of the bracelet and you have some control over the size of the individual rings.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the chainmail rings comes from  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45203, by Walter but it has been reimplemented in openscad."
