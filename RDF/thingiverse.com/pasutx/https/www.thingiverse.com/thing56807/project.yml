function: "This is a derivative of a scan as uploaded by Zenix. The uploaded file was huge and printing the hair requires some support. I have used blender to reduce the polygon count (from 172 MB to 3 MB), to smooth the surface and to add a few small supports for some parts of the hair.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  I beefed up the supports and put them on a small plate after people reported the supports where difficult to print. The original and the new stl are downloadable."
