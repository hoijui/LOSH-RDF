function: "This spool is made to be able to quickly change plastic of different colors which are on rolls of different diameters. Each hook is easily adjustable with a single bolt in a captive nut. It is important that the spool does not turn too easily which would allow the filament to get tangled.\r\nThe arms of the spool are aluminium extrusions of 10x10 mm.\r\n\r\nThe idea for the construction is borrowed from the \"damped spool\" by FatFreddie."
