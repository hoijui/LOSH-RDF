function: "C60 based structure comprised of Pentagon and Hexagon plates connected to center core by coil springs. I first designed this in 2001. Feel free to download and build \r\n\r\nI made one error on this design, the lack of filleting on the \"coil to plate core junction\" and \"plate junctions\" will reduce its resistance to fracture from cyclic deformations. However in Nylon it works fine.\r\n\r\n1. Always be generous with fillets for surfaces undergoing cyclic tensile stress - especially at the acute apex of the junction.\r\n2. with springs always over model position as typically they will creep deform to a stable state after initial cycling\r\n\r\nNote it will Bounce just like a rubber ball\r\n\r\n-  send me photos - enjoy ! Pat"
