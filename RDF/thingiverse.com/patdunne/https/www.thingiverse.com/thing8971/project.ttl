    okh:function """Your creativity is your only limitation when designing complex engineered textiles or chainmails. In this example, a 3 sided MÃ¶bius link not only generates an interesting structure but actually generates an â€œelasticâ€ network of links each can be stretched when pulled in a all directions.\r
\r
\r
Consider chainmail's that transition into plates, chainmail's where the links get progressively thicker in regions enabling controlled zones of opacity and flexibility.\r
\r
The application of spikes to every link combined with hooks for quick release and fastening, enables some interesting novel textiles for applications in fashion. I might upload my " MacroFur" design if i can find it.\r
\r
Feel free to download  - Enjoy!\r
