    okh:function """The only power supply I had laying around was a 600 watt with a downward facing fan, therefore I was unable to put it inside of my MakerBot.  I guess I could have but I don\\'t like setting things on fire.  I made these simple legs and attached them to the four corners of the base.  Once I make the hole for the fan and put the power supply in I will add some other pictures. Designed in NX5..... once I remember how to rotate an object without copying it I will post some new files.\r
\r
Figured it out, new file is up.  I had to file the m3 holes when I used the last version.  You shouldn't need to with this one.""" ;
