So the last contest that required magnets didn't receive much attention and was poorly timed (ended on a holiday weekend).  I'm supplying more time and money for this one so hopefully there will be a bigger turn out.  I would like to do more of these contests but will probably lose interest if there are too few entries.\r
\r
Fido, if you are reading this check your email so I can get you the money from the last contest.\r

Thanks to tmophoto ($15) and Bo L. ($50) for helping up the prize money.""" ;
