function: "This is the first of two contests with a current prize pool of $100.\r\n\r\nAll submissions to this contest need to use one or multiple rubber band(s) in some way to enable the printable side of the submission to do something cool/neat/funny/novel.\r\n\r\nSome people asked for more time on the last competition so they could have more time to focus and channel their powers of design..... so this one ends in 3 weeks and 3 days (Sunday, Nov 14).  \r\n\r\nIf you are feeling generous and want to spur creativity, feel free to donate to the prize pool.  Last time we more than doubled the prize..... plus my $50 feels sad and lonely.\r\n\r\nThanks to twotimes for upping the prize pool to $100 total \r\n\r\nFind the other contest here:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4528"
