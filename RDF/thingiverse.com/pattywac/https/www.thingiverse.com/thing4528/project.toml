function = "This is the second of two contests with a current prize pool of $65.\r\n\r\nAll submissions to this contest need to be an improvement for the Makerbot.  A few examples but not requirements are: xy-stage improvements, wobble arresters, legs, circuit board holders, etc.\r\n\r\nAs with the other contest, this one ends in 3 weeks and 3 days (Sunday, Nov 14). \r\n\r\nIf you are feeling generous and want to spur creativity, feel free to donate to the prize pool. Last time we more than doubled the prize.\r\n\r\nFind the other contest here:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4527\r\n\r\nThanks to Twotimes for adding $50 to the $15 I put in."
