To enter be sure and tag your Thing with the word â€œMashMeUpâ€x9d\r\n\r\nThe entries will be judged using the following criteria:\r\n\r\n    * Number of Likes on Thingiverse\r\n    * Number of times it has been made by someone else\r\n    * Average Thingiverse rating\r\n    * Printability (not just fitting it in the space but also how many separate prints are required)\r\n    * Effort put into design (based on testing and revisions (if at all needed), how well does it fit the challenge)\r\n    * Mechanical design (based on # of pieces, possible modes for failure, etc)\r\n    * Does it build on previous challenge winners?\r\n    * Future for use in other Thingiverse designs\r\n    * Are multiple (editable) file formats provided?\r\n    * Number of other items combined from Thingiverse to make new design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGRATS TO EMMITT, the winner of $100 Makerbot store credit (from Makerbot) and $56 cash prize ($50 from me, $6 from people through Flattr).  Here is the link to his winning entry (Heart Gears):\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6291\r\n\r\nYou should all print one.... this thing is pretty sweet (all puns intended).  I think the only improvement could be changing the gears to all prime numbers so getting it back to a perfect fit will drive people insaaaaaneeeeee.\r\n\r\nNew challenge later this week  -  Keep your eyes peeled."
