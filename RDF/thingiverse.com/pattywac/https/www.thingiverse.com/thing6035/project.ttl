\r
Rules:\r
\r
   1. Needs to be printable (at least partlyâ€¦ Unicorns and Frostruders included) on a Makerbot\r
   2. Needs to combine at least two other designs (can include new designs of your own making, but they need to be posted as separate items)\r
   3. Post submissions on Thingiverse by 8pm CST on Feb 27, 2011.\r
   4. Multiple entries are allowed, but they must be distinct from one another.\r
   5. To enter be sure and tag your Thing with the word â€œMashMeUpâ€x9d\r
\r
The entries will be judged using the following criteria:\r
\r
    * Number of Likes on Thingiverse\r
    * Number of times it has been made by someone else\r
    * Average Thingiverse rating\r
    * Printability (not just fitting it in the space but also how many separate prints are required)\r
    * Effort put into design (based on testing and revisions (if at all needed), how well does it fit the challenge)\r
    * Mechanical design (based on # of pieces, possible modes for failure, etc)\r
    * Does it build on previous challenge winners?\r
    * Future for use in other Thingiverse designs\r
    * Are multiple (editable) file formats provided?\r
    * Number of other items combined from Thingiverse to make new design\r

You should all print one.... this thing is pretty sweet (all puns intended).  I think the only improvement could be changing the gears to all prime numbers so getting it back to a perfect fit will drive people insaaaaaneeeeee.\r

New challenge later this week  -  Keep your eyes peeled.""" ;
