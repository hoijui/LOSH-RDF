    okh:function """With a great bust, comes a great responsibility.  We must use Stephen Colbert scans in the greatest design challenge to date, the Makerstrong Mashup Challenge.  I canâ€™t guarantee that a mashup resulting in a printable clock with a Steve Colbert head-pendulum and gears embossed with his likeness or a printable tank with a giant Colbert bust on the top that shoots smaller Colbert busts out would win, but they definitely wouldnâ€™t get last placeâ€¦\r
\r
Just to clarify, all submissions to this challenge must use at least one of the Stephen Colbert head scans included in the following post and use it as part of a new thing posting â€œhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9104â€\r
\r
The initial prize will be $60 cash transferred via Paypal from me, and $100 in Makerbot store credit, generously supplied by MakerBot Industries.  IF we can somehow get Mr. Cobert to agree to be a guest judge on the panel for the challenge, I will up the cash prize to $150 transferred via Paypal.  Any flattr money will also be added to the prize pool.""" ;
