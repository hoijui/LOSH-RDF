function: "With a great bust, comes a great responsibility.  We must use Stephen Colbert scans in the greatest design challenge to date, the Makerstrong Mashup Challenge.  I can\xE2\u20AC\u2122t guarantee that a mashup resulting in a printable clock with a Steve Colbert head-pendulum and gears embossed with his likeness or a printable tank with a giant Colbert bust on the top that shoots smaller Colbert busts out would win, but they definitely wouldn\xE2\u20AC\u2122t get last place\xE2\u20AC\xA6\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, all submissions to this challenge must use at least one of the Stephen Colbert head scans included in the following post and use it as part of a new thing posting \xE2\u20AC\u0153http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9104\xE2\u20AC\x9D\r\n\r\nThe initial prize will be $60 cash transferred via Paypal from me, and $100 in Makerbot store credit, generously supplied by MakerBot Industries.  IF we can somehow get Mr. Cobert to agree to be a guest judge on the panel for the challenge, I will up the cash prize to $150 transferred via Paypal.  Any flattr money will also be added to the prize pool."
