    okh:function """This is a work derived from curiosity. I just wanted to know how it would be to juggle a printed devil stick. For those how do not yet know it, a devil stick is one of the lesser known objects for juggling, not as common as balls, clubs or diabolos. It is juggled by controlling it with two control sticks, that you hold in your hands.\r
\r
The great advantage of a printed stick over a normal stick made of wood is that it can be disassembled, if you need to stow it away for travel. \r
\r
The result of my juggling experiment: it is a bit heavy for my taste (250g) but juggles allright. I can perform all the tricks I normally do with it as well. And it doesn't need tape because of its fine surface structure.""" ;
