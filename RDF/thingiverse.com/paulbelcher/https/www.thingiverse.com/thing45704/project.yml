function: "Hi-\r\nI designed this little thing for a project at Kishwaukee College. It's a simple, very useful bag clip. To use, just fold over the open top of your bag a couple of times and simply slip this clip over the folded edge.\r\nThis little gadget is as simple as it gets, but I find it to be very useful. I've printed and handed out dozens of these here using our uPrint SE+, and haven't recevied any complaints about it.\r\nI'm providing an stl and a sldprt file for Solidworks if you'd like to modify the part at all.\r\nPlease let me know if you print one of these and try it out this by sending me an email at paulbelcher@gmail.com - I'd really like to hear from unbiased people about how you find the product works for you.\r\nThank you!\r\nPaul"
