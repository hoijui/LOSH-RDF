The stl processor and print manager is called CatalystEX 4.1, and I normally print at a resolution of 0.010\", solid infill and with all support material being automatically managed by the printing software.\r\n\r\nStl and SolidWorks sldprt files are included - use them anyway you'd like, all I ask is that you please let me know if you print one and find it useful or have any other feedback for me.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nPaul"
