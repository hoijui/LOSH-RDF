function: "This is another design I had made for the simple bag clip published earlier at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45704\r\nI'm posting this now based on the feedback received from the original design, and was wondering if maybe this is a better version? \r\n\r\n\r\nI print using a uPrint SE+ printer at Kishwaukee College in Malta, Il. where I'm a C.N.C./Machinist/Tooling Design student. The stl processor and print manager is called CatalystEX 4.1, and I normally print at a resolution of 0.010\", solid infill and with all support material being automatically managed by the printing software.\r\n\r\nStl and SolidWorks sldprt files are included - use them anyway you'd like, all I ask is that you please let me know if you print one and find it useful or have any other feedback for me.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nPaul"
