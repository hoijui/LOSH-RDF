function = "Okay, one last simple bag clip design from me. This one features two complete loops, and is the design I personally found the least useful of the three I've made. \r\nSome people I made this design for loved them however, so I figured I might as well put it up here and see what you guys think.\r\n\r\nThe previous two are http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45704 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47053 \r\n\r\n\r\nFor information, I use a uPrint SE+ printer that the college I go to is nice enough to let me play with (alot!) My stl processing and print management is done with CadalystEX 4.1 that is included with the printer. I print at a resolution of 0.010\", solid infill and I let the software determine the support material.\r\n\r\nStl and Solidworks sldprt files are included - use them however you'd like. All I ask is that if you print out one or more of these simple bag clips I've designed, please leave a comment here or email me at paulbelcher@gmail.com to let me know what you think, or if you can think of any improvements.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nPaul"
