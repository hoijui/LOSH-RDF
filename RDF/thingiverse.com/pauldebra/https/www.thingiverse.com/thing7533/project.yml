function: "The supports for an accordeon tend to break after some years.\r\nThere are (unfortunately) several types. This one is for larger (conservatory) instruments.\r\nNote that the hole for the screw is not in the center. There are two possible pieces which are a mirror image of each other.\r\nThese pieces are available in accordion parts stores but seldom in stock and stores are few and far between... so unless you live near Castelfidardo in Italy making your own piece is easier than buying it.\r\nThis was created in Google Sketchup."
