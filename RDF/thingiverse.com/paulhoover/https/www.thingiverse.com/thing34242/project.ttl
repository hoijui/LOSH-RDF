I tried putting a ring underneath it, but it needs a bit more work.  Good luck if you want to to try to make it work.  Play with maxdepth in Structure Synth if you want to make an open bracelet or less rings.\r
\r
Then I was playing with making it look like it was an underwater creature.  Check out the .es file in structure synth if you want to play with it.""" ;
