function: "This is an improved version of the original Cryptex: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7233\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly large Cryptex, which is a personal storage vault for valuable items or documents based on a concept described in The Davinci Code.  Kids love it! \r\n\r\nMy design is based on the excellent creation of pasutx, which is also available on Thingiverse. My goal was to create a Cryptex that did not require any separate parts, paper or gluing.\r\n\r\nI suggest printing the Inner Tube and Outer Tube in separate colors if that capability is available to you. It looks great when the combination is dialed in and the two tubes are separated.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the integrated design of the embossed lettering on the wheels and one piece stops on the tubes, this design will likely only print on a printer that includes support material. I printed this Cryptex on a Dimension BST with tolerances of .01. \r\n\r\nEnhancements from the original include:\r\n1) All 26 alpha and 10 number wheels are now available to print. This means any 5 character combination can be constructed.\r\n\r\n2) The wheels click when dialing to provide more accurate registration of correct combination.\r\n\r\n3) The wheels are now locked with two additional\" deception stops\" to make it much harder to pick if the combination is not known.\r\n\r\n4) The letters/numbers on the wheels are larger and cleaner."
