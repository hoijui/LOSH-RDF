function = "This is a fairly large Cryptex, which is a personal storage vault for valuable items or documents based on a concept described in The Davinci Code. This particular design is easily picked and so it is more appropriate for fun than the actual storage of valuable items. Kids love it! \r\n\r\nMy design is based on the excellent creation of pasutx, which is also available on Thingiverse. My goal was to create a Cryptex that did not require any separate parts, paper or gluing. It can be easily modified to make it more secure by adding additional \"deception\" stops on the Outer Tube.\r\n\r\nThis Cryptex was created for a friend's birthday so it unlocks when the wheels are aligned as DEC14.\r\n\r\nI suggest printing the Inner Tube and Outer Tube in separate colors if that capability is available to you. It looks great when the combination is dialed in and the two tubes are separated.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the integrated design of the embossed lettering on the wheels and one piece stops on the tubes, this design will likely only print on a printer that includes support material. I printed this Cryptex on a Dimension BST with tolerances of .01 and all parts are appropriately tight, but operate smoothly. If anyone has suggestions that will allow the design to print without support material, I'm willing to give it a try.\r\n\r\nI will upload a video of the working Cryptex on YouTube."
