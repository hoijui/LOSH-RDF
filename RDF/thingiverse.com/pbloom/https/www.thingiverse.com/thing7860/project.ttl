    okh:function """This is a classic toy that demonstrates some interesting principles of geometry and mechanical motion. It is sometimes called an "ellipsograph" because it traces a perfect ellipse.\r
\r
Here is a detailed description from Wikipedia with an animation of the "grinder" in action: \r
\r
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trammel_of_Archimedes\r
\r
This is my own design, but it mirrors many well known versions that have fascinated kids (and adults) for thousands of years.\r
\r
Note that the handle has a hexagonal hole that allows you to insert a cut-down pencil for ellipse drawing.\r
\r
The motion is hypnotic and I hope you have fun printing and playing with this version of the Nothing Grinder.\r
\r
Note: This model requires no supports. If you can print with two different filaments then color contrasting the rods and handle lettering can make the model even more intriguing.""" ;
