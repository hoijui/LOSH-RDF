function: "This is a classic toy that demonstrates some interesting principles of geometry and mechanical motion. It is sometimes called an \"ellipsograph\" because it traces a perfect ellipse.\r\n\r\nHere is a detailed description from Wikipedia with an animation of the \"grinder\" in action: \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trammel_of_Archimedes\r\n\r\nThis is my own design, but it mirrors many well known versions that have fascinated kids (and adults) for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nNote that the handle has a hexagonal hole that allows you to insert a cut-down pencil for ellipse drawing.\r\n\r\nThe motion is hypnotic and I hope you have fun printing and playing with this version of the Nothing Grinder.\r\n\r\nNote: This model requires no supports. If you can print with two different filaments then color contrasting the rods and handle lettering can make the model even more intriguing."
