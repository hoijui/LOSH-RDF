function: "This is a mounting bracket and bowden tube connector for two 5ml syringes. \r\nThey are fixed to the right side of the ultimaker extruder head. it is designed to be light (when not in use), so it can be left on your printer. It does reduce your maximum x-stroke a bit.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to print chocolate (or any other material).\r\nYou may use the bowden tube, future alterations might include a pressure dispense connector or lead screw drive (work in progress!)"
