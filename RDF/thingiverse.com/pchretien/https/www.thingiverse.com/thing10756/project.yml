function: "This type of astrophotography mount is often called a barndoor mount, a scotch mount or a Haig mount. This mount allows you to take long exposure of the night sky by canceling out the apparent motion of the stars in the sky. \r\n\r\nYou can get more information on this type of device on Wikipedia:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_door_tracker.\r\n\r\nThe version displayed here is made using soft wood (pine) but the final assembly should be made of hard wood such as maple.\r\n\r\nNote: The mechanism is working as expected but I am still having some vibrations transmitted to the camera. I have to eliminate these before to try taking any pictures. Improvements are on the way ... stay tuned."
