function = "Y-axis of the Prusa i2 (or any other compatible version) is normally limited to the dimensions of the printer. I built my Prusa i2 with an over-mount Y-axis smooth rods allowing the print bed to roll over and above the frame. This requires 1 extra long Y-axis smooth rod to mount the end-stop. Bend the long smooth rod or cut it as required."
