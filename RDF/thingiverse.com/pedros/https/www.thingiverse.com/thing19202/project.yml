function: "This is the 3D printer that I am building which is currently mostly made from steel square section and angle held together with almost acceptable welding. I did a couple of calibration boxes for a first fix test with varying degrees of success and then went for a 30% size owl by cushwa. The result was not bad considering the state of build and lack of proper upper slide bearings.\r\n\r\nthingiverse.com/derivative:24195\r\n\r\nAnyway, I now need to pull it apart to make some adjustments (a bit more welding drilling and file work and bashing) then add a heated bed."
