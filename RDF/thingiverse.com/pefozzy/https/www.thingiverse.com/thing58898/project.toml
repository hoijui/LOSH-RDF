function = "This is a replacement hinge insert for Little TIkes toys. I created this to fix a Little Tikes kitchen we received second hand as a gift for our son. The oven door hinge was broken. I created the 3D model and printed two replacement parts, and now the oven door works just fine. \r\n\r\n2015.10.27 Update: Based on request, I added a smaller version of the hinge for the smaller, cupboard doors."
