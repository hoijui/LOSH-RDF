function: "I designed this solder holder in just a few minutes on http://3dtin.com  \r\nYou definitely need a heated build platform to print it.  \r\nEven with my heated platform, it still had a little warping in the corners.  \r\n \r\nSuggestions for improvement are welcome!  \r\nIt takes about 45 minutes to print.  \r\n \r\nConsider this object to be a proof of concept for printing unedited STL files  \r\nexported directly from 3dTin. It's nice to have a 3d editor so easy to use  \r\nthat a 5 year old can enjoy building with it."
