function: "Two different designs for a box to store 10 DS/3DS games in. The first one is a single part, where the games are secured with a rubber band - hence the notch on the bottom. The second one is two-part, with a base and a slide-on lid. Built with Sketchup, printed with a Replicator 2\r\n\r\n[edit] I did some tweaking on the box with lid. Now, you don't have to slide the lid all the way, but rather only the last centimeter. Also, the box is now 2mm smaller than before, and 1mm thinner. Finally, instead of friction on the whole length of the lid, there is now a little \"boss\" that holds the lid closed."
