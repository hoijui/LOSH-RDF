function: "The tabs and pins that the lid of the trash can hinges on snapped off years ago. This is a more elegant solution than my original quick fix (bent wire hanger). I overestimated how far back the pivot points used to be, so a full press of the pedal doesn't let the lid fall shut. I decided that's not a bug but a feature. It's an Umbra step trash can, but I imagine this would be a good starting point even if you have a different brand.  \n\n\n\nThe pins are 4mm in diameter and 15mm long (the version I printed has 10mm pins, but they just barely made it). The brackets are 15mm wide, extend 15mm back and hang down 25mm. Screw holes are 3mm in diameter and bore centers are 10mm apart.  \n\n\n\nUPDATE: The originals broke after about two months. I'm not sure if just printing them again with the longer pegs and on my new printer would've been good enough, so I redesigned them.  \n\nUPDATE: Nylon top hinges last very long, over a year on one set, but now the bottom hinge has weakened to the point of breaking, so I had to replace that."
