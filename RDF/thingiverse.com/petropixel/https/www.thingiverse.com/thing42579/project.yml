function: "Added combustion chamber recesses to the rotor, spark plug holes and intake/exhaust ports to the housing. Technically the ports should take a 90 degree bend and exit out the side, but then you wouldn't be able to watch the rotor movement from the crank side of the housing.\r\n\r\nThe crank and eccentric have been modified for a looser fit, the originals weren't working for me."
