    okh:function """I liked the original, but I made a few changes before printing mine.\r
-Solid body\r
-Flat bottom\r
-Pin-based axles\r
(These changes were to reduce overhangs, allow for support-free printing)\r
-Scaled down 50%, but kept balloon inlet/outlet closer to original size\r
-Optional spare tire\r
\r
When I did finally print it, I ran into two problems.\r
1. It doesn't roll. Whittling down the axles and opening up the hubs with a drill bit got me wheels that freewheel very nicely in the air, but when I put the car down and push it along they just gain a bunch of camber and slide along, maybe 1 or 2 wheels spinning at a time.\r
2. We haven't had a kid's birthday here in quite a while, so the balloons we have pop easily and don't provide much thrust below their bursting point. This is probably easier to fix (just buy new balloons).""" ;
