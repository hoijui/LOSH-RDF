function: "I liked the original, but I made a few changes before printing mine.\r\n-Solid body\r\n-Flat bottom\r\n-Pin-based axles\r\n(These changes were to reduce overhangs, allow for support-free printing)\r\n-Scaled down 50%, but kept balloon inlet/outlet closer to original size\r\n-Optional spare tire\r\n\r\nWhen I did finally print it, I ran into two problems.\r\n1. It doesn't roll. Whittling down the axles and opening up the hubs with a drill bit got me wheels that freewheel very nicely in the air, but when I put the car down and push it along they just gain a bunch of camber and slide along, maybe 1 or 2 wheels spinning at a time.\r\n2. We haven't had a kid's birthday here in quite a while, so the balloons we have pop easily and don't provide much thrust below their bursting point. This is probably easier to fix (just buy new balloons)."
