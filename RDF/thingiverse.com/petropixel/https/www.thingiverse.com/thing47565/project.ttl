    okh:function """This was an idea I had when fiddling with the balloon car. I spent the day thinking about how to make it instead of going out to buy new balloons, so I haven't actually tested it with a good balloon, but sticking a straw in the inlet and blowing spins it up pretty fast and makes a cool turbo whistle sound.\r
\r
UPDATE: I actually bought new balloons! 12" "helium-quality" party balloons. They spin the turbine, but they have larger necks so you have to hold the balloon in place and there is some leakage. I'm working on a version 2 with a larger inlet, as well as a larger diameter output shaft.\r
\r
UPDATE 2: Version 2 is here, and you can see it work! http://youtu.be/8Q6svYMZowU\r
It only runs for about 3 seconds, I'm assuming that's because I opened the inlet up? Maybe because I don't want to pop a balloon this late at night again. Sounds cool, though.""" ;
