function: "This is a replacement crank for these flashlights: http://www.harborfreight.com/pack-of-2-dynamo-led-flashlights-65207.html\r\n\r\nI bought these during the \"Halloween Nor'easter\" back in 2011. I broke the crank on one about 3 days into our power outage. At the time I fixed it with \"plastic welding\" (I stuck a large flathead screwdriver into a fireplace, then jammed it into the busted handle and melted it back together. Proper safety precautions were taken, don't try this at home.) but I have the tool to fix it properly now."
