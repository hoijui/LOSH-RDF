function: I built an "arc reactor" out of an exploded LED flashlight and a plastic bottle a few years back, but for a while I've been thinking that if the light source was electroluminescent, the light distribution would be more even and it wouldn't stick out of my chest so obviously. I've worked with EL wire before, and when I saw that cutting EL panels into custom shapes was even more difficult, I decided to take an easier route.
