    okh:function """The reviews are in, and they're unanimous: the car you and your team designed doesn't have enough power! The engine bay isn't long enough to fit an inline engine with more cylinders, or wide enough for a V engine. What to do?  
Well, you could just make the engine bay bigger.  
You could get more power out of the same engine using forced induction.  
Or you could take one of the roads less traveled, and squeeze a few more cylinders into roughly the same space.  

This cylinder configuration has only been used by two automakers (Lancia and Volkswagen Group) and recently by one upstart motorcycle company (Horex). The two banks of cylinders are just 11 degrees apart (60 degrees is considered optimal for a V6) and offset just far enough to keep the cylinder bores from overlapping. It's not really that complicated a setup, but I did not understand it as well as I thought I did when I started this project.  
The combination of flat-plane crankshaft and narrow vee angle does make these models a bit less interesting to watch than sirmakealot's, when one piston reaches TDC the second one it shares a crank pin with is almost there too.  

New alternate crankshafts: a crossplane one from my W engines for the VR6 and a flatplane one with more accurate cylinder pairing for the V4. Rods are now slightly narrower for better clearance.""" ;
