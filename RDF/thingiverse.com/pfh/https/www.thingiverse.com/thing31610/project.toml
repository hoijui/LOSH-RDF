function = "This is an alto sized flute with folk fingering system (like a penny-whistle). Consists of three sections, which slide together. The bore shape and hole parameters have been designed using Python package \"demakein\" so that the flute is in tune over two octaves.\r\n\r\nThanks to John Boshua for the excellent print in ABS plastic.\r\n\r\nSample audio:\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/paul-francis-harrison/adew-dundee-3d-printed-flute"
