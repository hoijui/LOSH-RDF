function: "This is a soprano sized flute with a recorder-like fingering system. Like a recorder, much of the chromatic scale is available by cross-fingering. Consists of three sections, which slide together.\r\n\r\nThe bore shape and hole parameters have been designed using Python package \"demakein\" so that the flute is in tune over two octaves. The holes are angled to provide a comfortable spacing.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a somewhat complex fingering system. If you're familiary with recorder, cool. If your're after something simple to play like a fife, perhaps try this model instead: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38865\r\n\r\nThanks to John Boshua for the excellent print in ABS plastic. I added some decorative rings to the design, after it was printed."
