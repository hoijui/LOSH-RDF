function = "A shawm, a double reed instrument, the wild ancestor of the oboe and the archetypal medieval sound.\r\n\r\nThis shawm is about the same size as an alto recorder. The pitch is an octave above alto voice.\r\n\r\nThanks to John Boshua for the excellent print. The STL files are slightly updated from the shawm in the photos, with a decorative end flare and improved finger hole geometry."
