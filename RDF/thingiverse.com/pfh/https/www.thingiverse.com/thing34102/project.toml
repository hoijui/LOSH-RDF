function = "The shawm is the loud medieval ancestor of the oboe.\r\n\r\nThis shawm has a simple six-hole fingering system. I am particularly pleased by how this model turned out. The finger spacing is not too wide (32mm between holes), and it can play a solid octave and a half.\r\n\r\nThe pitch is similar to soprano voice (tenor plus one octave).\r\n\r\nThanks again to John Boshua for an excellent print in ABS plastic.\r\n\r\nSample audio:\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/paul-francis-harrison/ja-nuns-hons-pris-shawm"
