function = "Basic text renderer implemented as an OpenSCAD module, allowing the generation of text from a string directly in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nCurrently uses a HD44780 LCD controller dot matrix font.\r\n\r\nTwo versions exist, TextGenerator.scad covers all OpenSCAD versions before 2015.03. Version 2015.03 deprecated the assign module, allowing for more convenient C like assignments. Therefore I've created a new version removing the deprecated module warning generated by this version."
