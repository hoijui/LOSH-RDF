function = "Convert a message recorded in Microsoft Wave format into a 3D printed bracelet / necklace / thing.  \n\nGiven a wave file the python script included with this thing will digitize it into a series of concentric circles forming a bracelet like design, creating an OpenSCAD script.  \n\n\nThe OpenSCAD script may be used to view the waveform arranged as a bracelet design as well as preparing trays of circles ready for printing, all numbers to allow for assembly.  \n\nInspired by: http://www.instructables.com/id/Waveform-Necklace-Bracelet/"
