function = "I made a simple phone stand for my galaxy blaze that can display it either horizontal or vertical. I rounded the edges on the bottom so there is no worry about screen contact.   \n\nUpdated!   \nI cut out about 1.5mm off the bottom of the stand as well as cutting slices in the bottom and back stand. Next I might do the back if I don't rubber coat it. I left the old version there in case you wanted one you could also use as a baton,"
