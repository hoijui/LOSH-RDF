function = "The TinyCylon is a very small (49.5mm x 10.5mm) 12 LED Larson Scanner. It runs off 4 pins on an ATTiny85.\r\n\r\nWe're able to run 12 LEDs from 4 pins via Charlieplexing. \r\n\r\nWe've used SMD Components to keep the size small. In particular 1206 SMD LEDs and 0805 SMD Resistors. \r\n\r\nThe board schematics are available for KiCad.\r\n\r\nKit is now available at http://phenoptix.com/products/phenoptix-tinycylon-12-led-larson-scanner-kit-smd-soldering-kit still a work in progress though!"
