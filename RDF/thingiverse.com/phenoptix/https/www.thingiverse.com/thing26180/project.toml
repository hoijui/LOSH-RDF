function = "This is using the same trace route as the Tiny Cylon but with a bit more space to make a single sided PCB. Also we've used an ATTiny2313 this time as it has 4 PWM pins so we can make a better scan. \r\nUpdated board to double sided also added prototyping area and 20 pins to break out the pins of the ATTiny."
