function: "This Christmas will be the Christmas of the laser cutter, maybe next year it will be the Replicator Christmas. I've seen these (or similar) either for sale or in shop displays and wanted to cut one for myself. I found a 3d model on Sketchup (http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=cf1d7aeec6aed98ab9f437bcb24b35f) which seems to predate anywhere that is selling the model. Exploded and printed it flat then reworked the model for 3mm materials.\r\n\r\nThe scale allows it to be cut from two sheets of A4 size.\r\n\r\nMarked as a derivative, however it's more of an inspired by!\r\n\r\nWith the acrylic version, the slots on the back needed reversing as they don't hold together as well as the ply version and gravity is not your friend. So I've added a V2 with corrected slots and also a loop for screw / picture pin mounting.\r\n\r\nAfter a number of requests! http://www.phenoptix.com/products/laser-cut-deer-reindeer-rudolph-head"
