function = "A modified version of the calling card. I don't have a laser cutter, or delicate hands, but I do have a 48\" x 48\" CNC router! I scaled the pattern up to about 7.5\" tall, modified the shape to be a square instead of a business card, and made a few small tweaks to the gears so they would cut nicely with a 1/8\" endmill out of MDF.\r\n\r\nNo finish or fasteners besides glue. Just a little composite chunk of geary goodness."
