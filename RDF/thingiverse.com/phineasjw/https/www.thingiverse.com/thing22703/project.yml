function: "This is a very cool center finder invented by http://www.thingiverse.com/hlyman.  I rank this as one of the most interesting and useful things on the thingiverse.  Certainly the backstory is the most compelling.\r\n\r\nI scaled it to 75% to fit the replicator bed.  I also redesigned the pins to make them a press fit, thus eliminating the need for screws on those parts.  I also redesigned the rotating brackets and control knobs to improve their operation after scaling.  \r\n\r\nI put multiple parts in one file to speed up printing.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Scale the Right Arm file using inches->mm button or download the last file on the list which has the scale fixed already."
