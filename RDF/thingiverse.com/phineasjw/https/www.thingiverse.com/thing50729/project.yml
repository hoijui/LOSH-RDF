function: "I have started experimenting with using this Polyester tape Updated LInk 08/25/2014: http://www.laserbits.com/laser-supplies/masking-materials/sus-063-polyester-rigid-mask-medium-tack-6-in-25-yds.html for my Replicator 1 heated bed based on threads I saw on printer forums.  I prefer it over the Kapton because   \n- It is much more resistant to tearing when removing parts after build, and when getting off the roll  \n- 6\" width can cover heated bed in 1 strip  \n- Similar price when you compare square inches per roll  \n- Good adhesion when combined with the miracle adhesion improver (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28787)  \n- Easier to remove than stock Kapton  \nI am printing small to medium sized parts in ABS with a bed temp of 50C and acceptable adhesion.  This greatly reduces melt deformation of the features directly on the bed layer.  \nFor small parts with little bed contact on the first layer, I add a 0.25mm thick base in CAD to increase the contact surface area of the first layer for better bonding.  This print base is fairly easily peeled off the part after printing."
