function: "There's been a lot of argument about weapons on Thingiverse lately. Most of it has been folks talking past each other. Can't we all just get along?\r\n\r\nSo here's a simple flower that will fit in the barrel of your AK-5000 or whatever. Print one out and give it to your local gun collector, national guardsman, armed gangster, or high seas pirate. After all, everyone needs a flower once in a while.\r\n\r\n(The flower is from Renosis' super-fun push-puppet.)"
