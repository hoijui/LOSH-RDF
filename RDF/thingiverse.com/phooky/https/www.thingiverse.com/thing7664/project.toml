function = "By request, this is the famous, fabulous lampshade script. We've used it to produce lampshades, bracelets, faux ABS LPs, small storage cups, and in any situation where a hollow cylindrical or conical form optionally with a solid bottom is called for.\r\n\r\nThis script takes an image file as input and produces a gcode file that will create a conical form of the specified parameters, with the image embossed on the surface. It's recommended that you use the -c flag, which will cause the form to be built as a single, continuous spiral.\r\n\r\nYou may need to edit the script or its output to add your own pre- and post- print gcodes. Be sure to cast an eye over the output before you print!\r\n\r\nPrinting these forms in clear PLA is particularly pleasing!\r\n\r\nThe code is maintained in git; the latest version is always available at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/makerbot/Makerbot/tree/master/scripts/lampshade\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
