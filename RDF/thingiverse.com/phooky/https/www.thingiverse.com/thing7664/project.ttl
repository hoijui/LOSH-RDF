    okh:function """By request, this is the famous, fabulous lampshade script. We've used it to produce lampshades, bracelets, faux ABS LPs, small storage cups, and in any situation where a hollow cylindrical or conical form optionally with a solid bottom is called for.\r
\r
This script takes an image file as input and produces a gcode file that will create a conical form of the specified parameters, with the image embossed on the surface. It's recommended that you use the -c flag, which will cause the form to be built as a single, continuous spiral.\r
\r
You may need to edit the script or its output to add your own pre- and post- print gcodes. Be sure to cast an eye over the output before you print!\r
\r
Printing these forms in clear PLA is particularly pleasing!\r
\r
The code is maintained in git; the latest version is always available at:\r

Have fun!""" ;
