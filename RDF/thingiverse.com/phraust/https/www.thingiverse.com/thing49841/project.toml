function = "The hinges on my old MacBook Ait froze up and busted, and this point it's not worth it to me to buy the new parts (something like $200).\r\n\r\nSo I built these to hold the screen up when open, and not take up too much space.  I just epoxied em to the bottom of the Air, and they hold the screen at a pretty good angle."
