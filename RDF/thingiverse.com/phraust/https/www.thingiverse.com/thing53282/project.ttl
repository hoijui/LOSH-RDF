\r
I goofed around with some of the higher powered fans, and luckily didn't break anything.  I guess the max draw for the Printrboard is something like 500mA (?) so I put the lowest power fan I could find on it (0.20a).  We'll see how this goes...\r
\r
Looking at the Printrbot.com site, it looks like they've changed the extruder design included with the JR's.  This is designed for the lasercut/wood one that came with mine.""" ;
