function = "This was just an experiment creating a printable spool after I had seen one elsewhere on Thingiverse.  I didn't have any, and needed a better way to manage my 1lb filament roll that had come with the printer.\r\n\r\nI had intended to mount it to my workbench, but ended up just hanging the spool and it worked fine without the central hub.\r\n\r\nNow I don't have to babysit my filament and untangle it every 5 minutes. :D\r\n\r\n*I've got some bearings now to use for this, so I'll probably be updating the hub to accommodate them.*"
