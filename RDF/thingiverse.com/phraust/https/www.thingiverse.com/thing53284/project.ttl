\r
I had intended to mount it to my workbench, but ended up just hanging the spool and it worked fine without the central hub.\r
\r
Now I don't have to babysit my filament and untangle it every 5 minutes. :D\r
\r
*I've got some bearings now to use for this, so I'll probably be updating the hub to accommodate them.*""" ;
