function: "I got some stainless steel threaded rod from Home Depot the other day, and some stainless steel nuts, and I wanted to upgrade my somewhat bent z-axis threaded rod.\r\n\r\nI had seen something similar for the Printrbot LC I think, so I made one to fit my machine.\r\n\r\nI tried dry-fitting it yesterday, and found that the nut I have is too large to replace the old one perfectly, so I'll have to engineer a mount for it on the Y-Arm.\r\n\r\nI'm currently waiting for the silicone to cure, so I'll update with some pics when it's complete."
