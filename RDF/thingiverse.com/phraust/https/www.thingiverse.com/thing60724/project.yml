function: "I ordered some new PLA from OSPWRD.com, and they came on these bigger spools, so I made some fittings to mount them with bearings on a piece of threaded rod.\r\n\r\nI guess I have humidity problems, cause all of the laser-cut spools and coasters I have are all warped to hell, so they don't work all that well.  At least I could scavenge the old ones for the bearings. :D\r\n\r\nI also made a stand, but it's kinda junk, so I'll upload that after I rebuild it."
