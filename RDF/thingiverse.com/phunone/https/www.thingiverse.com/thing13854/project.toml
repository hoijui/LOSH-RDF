function = "I accidentally printed the AAA Lid for the AA body by Shack90... I found out it was a perfect fit for the batteries I use for travelling... So I made a lid for the lid.\r\nIt can fit the following:\r\n- 2 AA, 3 AAA\r\n- 6 AAA\r\n- 4 AA\r\nSo I replace the empty spot with the used one and turn it upside down to prevent rattling."
