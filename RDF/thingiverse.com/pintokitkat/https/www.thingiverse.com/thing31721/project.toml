function = "Pleo is an autonomous robotic dinosaur whose battery packs are quite expensive.  \n\nThe design is to allow you to use ordinary AA Ni-MH batteries and the original (ie Ugobe) green battery charger.  Don't use it in the white 'egg' charger - that's for Lipoly batteries and I am confident they aren't compatible.  \n\nUpdate - May 2013 - The green photos  \n\nv7 is a redesign following the failure of a laptop mouse that had a spring loaded reel to wind the cable on.  Taking the reel apart I found a wonderful spring that can be cut and bent to make the battery connections."
