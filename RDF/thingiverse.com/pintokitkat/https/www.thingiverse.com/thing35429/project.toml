function = "This is a derivative of so many Thingiverse things, I apologise if I miss crediting anyone.  It is based on garycrowsellsr's fan guard (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26040) with an inspired addition prompted by nameless911 cardboard fan cover (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32660).  \r\n\r\nThe cardboard cover is so efficient at redirecting the air away from the build platform that it means I could run my platform 10 degrees lower without the print edges lifting.  But, being cardboard, it wasn't very robust or stylish.\r\n\r\nSo I added louvers to the plastic one to direct the air upwards, and that works fine.\r\n\r\nThe extension at the side is to trip the x axis microswitch on the Replicator."
