function = "I needed a new handle for my hose faucet out back and couldn't find one in the store. Once I finish my Prusa Mendel, I should be able to print this one out!\r\n\r\nNote that the screw hole has a solid layer underneath it so the overhang will have something to print on.  Also, I don't have a printer yet so this is definately a work in progress."
