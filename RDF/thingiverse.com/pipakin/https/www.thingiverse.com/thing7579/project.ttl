    okh:function """I saw the other design here on Thingiverse and remembered I had a very detailed 3d model of a Mad Cat on my computer.  I rebuilt the top and arms from scratch (since the model was not very manifold), but used the legs from the model as I got lazy.  So the legs are a tough print.\r
\r
UPDATE: For reference, this model inspired me to make this (Though this isn't a proper derivative as I made the model from scratch): http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7286\r
\r
UPDATE #2: Uploaded a manifold version of the legs.  Still makes Skeinforge complain a bit, but gets sliced much better.  I also made a plate with all the parts on it for easier printing (probably too big for a Makerbot, but you can always print the pieces individually).""" ;
