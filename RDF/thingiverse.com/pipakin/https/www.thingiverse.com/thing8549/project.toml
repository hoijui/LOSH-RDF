function = "I had some binding issues with the bushings and got tired of oiling my x-axis, so I made a x axis which uses 608 bearings to ride on the smooth rods. Note that this has a bunch of issues.  \r\n\r\nThe vertical bearings on the belt side need to be attached with something that will be flush with the back so the belt can fit back there.\r\n\r\nThe bearings have a little play, and may need to be moved slightly.  I just wrapped some tape around the outside of the diagonal bearings to make em a bit fatter.\r\n\r\nIt needs a long hot end (the makergear is ~5mm to short) to reach below the carriage.  I just modified the makergear to pull this off.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The STL is the SAE version.  to regenerate the stl as metric, just download the scad file and put it in the prusa mendel dir (configured for metric).  Adjust the existing x-carriage scad (comment out the last line) and then open the x-carriage-608.scad in openscad."
