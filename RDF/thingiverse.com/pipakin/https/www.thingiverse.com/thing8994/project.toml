function = "This is still a very early WIP for a full faceplate for a Prusa Mendel.  It's sized to fit my printer but the scad is fairly parametric if you want to generate it with different tolerances.  The next step is clip on covers for the verticies and the motor (which is in the front on my machine).\r\n\r\nP.S.: Ignore the tape on the side of my print there.  I took the picture before cleaning it off."
