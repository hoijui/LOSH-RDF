function = "I needed to layout full strings for a project so I extended donb's wonderful DraFont library.  This version will dump all ascii characters from a font by default, and provide a method for laying out strings.\r\n\r\nFor the brave, there is a git repo at https://github.com/pipakin/OpenSCAD-Font-Importer (This is not for the faint of heart, my python skills are substandard at best)\r\n\r\nNOTE: Complicated glyphs can take a long time to render, and I've managed to crash OpenSCAD a LOT by using long strings.  For example, \"FONTZ!\" takes 1 minute 30 seconds to render, while \"This is a test string.\" takes significantly longer (on the order of 13 minutes). So if you are going to use this for something, I recommend generating your string, rendering it, and then outputting an STL to use in your design with import_stl.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Removed the arial font (forgot about licensing), and substituted FreeSerif"
