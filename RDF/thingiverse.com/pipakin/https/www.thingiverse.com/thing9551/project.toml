function = "I needed to layout full strings for a project so I extended donb's wonderful DraFont library. This version will dump all ascii characters from a font by default, and provide a method for laying out strings.\r\n\r\nNew in version 1.1: String spacing settings!\r\n\r\nFor the brave, there is a git repo at github.com/pipakin/OpenSCAD-Font-Importer (This is not for the faint of heart, my python skills are substandard at best)\r\n\r\nNOTE: Complicated glyphs can take a long time to render, and I've managed to crash OpenSCAD a LOT by using long strings. For example, \"FONTZ!\" takes 1 minute 30 seconds to render, while \"This is a test string.\" takes significantly longer (on the order of 13 minutes). So if you are going to use this for something, I recommend generating your string, rendering it, and then outputting an STL to use in your design with import_stl."
