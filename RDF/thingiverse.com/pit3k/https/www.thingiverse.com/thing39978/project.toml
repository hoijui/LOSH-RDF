function = "Holder for easy mounting HobbyKing LED strips on Ultimaker.\r\n\r\nSo I had the \"Turnigy High Denisity LED Flexible Strips\" laying around. They are actually covered with sticking tape at the back, but it won't stick to well to the wood. Besides, I decided that for the ideal position I need to design a holder for them. And here it is. Just mounted it today and done first print - works very nicely - no clearance problems. Easy to assemble. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis is actually fully parametric in OpenSCAD, so you might adjust to different sizes of LED strips you happen to have."
