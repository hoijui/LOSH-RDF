function = "I made this for holding my Galaxy Nexus on the wall while I run on the treadmill - it lets me see the couch-to-5K timing program. The treadmill is parallel and next to the wall, so I wanted something that'd hold the phone perpendicular. \r\n\r\nVersion 2 has a slightly larger hole for the audio cable. I also rounded some corners to make it look a bit nicer."
