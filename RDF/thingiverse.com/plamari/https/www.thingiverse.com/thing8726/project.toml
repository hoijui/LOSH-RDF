function = "These springs have only been tested on Greg Frost's Hinged Extruder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8252 (as a replacement to the idler springs), although may be useful as a replacement for other springs.\r\n\r\nHaving said that I have also found it useful as a dampener to allow some play with my z motors, while keeping them firm and steady.\r\n\r\nThe silicone is a small ellipsoid shape cut from a Silicon pot holder from a \"$2 shop\", which has a small hole for a bolt to pass through.\r\n\r\nInitially this particular item caught my eye due to the claimed temperature durability, although I have not considered it for any hot applications yet."
