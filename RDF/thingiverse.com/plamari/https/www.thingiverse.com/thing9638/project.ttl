\r
Originally, I had a few more ideas of where it was going, but as I don't have many special tools, and I wanted to print more than bother too much, I ended up with this. As it has mainly been a hack without a clear path, I didn't take heaps of photos on the way.\r
\r
It would be easier to build with a drill press, although with a drill press there are probably better designs anyway.\r
\r
Tools required are a hacksaw and a hand drill. Steady hand optional.""" ;
