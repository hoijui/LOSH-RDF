function: "This open Y carriage is \"designed\" to allow an ordinary clothes iron to be used for heating the bed. It can be easily removed (when cold), plus it makes connecting and tensioning the y axis belts heaps easy.\r\n\r\nOriginally, I had a few more ideas of where it was going, but as I don't have many special tools, and I wanted to print more than bother too much, I ended up with this. As it has mainly been a hack without a clear path, I didn't take heaps of photos on the way.\r\n\r\nIt would be easier to build with a drill press, although with a drill press there are probably better designs anyway.\r\n\r\nTools required are a hacksaw and a hand drill. Steady hand optional."
