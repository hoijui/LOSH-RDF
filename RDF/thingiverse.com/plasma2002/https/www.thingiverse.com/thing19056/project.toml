These are not a copy of his design, but rather a new, hand drawn, rendition of the famous Look of Disapproval.   \r\n--------------------  \r\nJUST WANT TO PURCHASE A PAIR?  \r\nA few people have asked me if I could just sell them a pair. For this reason, you can now buy the glasses straight from my shop, The Plasmatorium: http://www.etsy.com/shop/Plasmatorium"
