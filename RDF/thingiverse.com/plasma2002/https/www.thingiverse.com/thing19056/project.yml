function: "\xE0\xB2\__\xE0\xB2\_  \r\nI needed some Look of Disapproval glasses in a pinch, and ended up drawing a pair and cutting them on my laser.   \r\nAfterwards, I noticed Thingiverse was missing the ever-so-helpful Look of Disapproval, so I figured I would fill the gap :)  \r\nThe idea came from a pair of the same type of glasses I had previously purchased from another maker, Tim Saylor. These are not a copy of his design, but rather a new, hand drawn, rendition of the famous Look of Disapproval.   \r\n--------------------  \r\nJUST WANT TO PURCHASE A PAIR?  \r\nA few people have asked me if I could just sell them a pair. For this reason, you can now buy the glasses straight from my shop, The Plasmatorium: http://www.etsy.com/shop/Plasmatorium"
