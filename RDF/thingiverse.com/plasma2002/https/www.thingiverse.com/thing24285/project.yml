function: "A mashup of my Look of Disapproval Glasses, and the infamous Shutter Shades. The Shutter Shades of Disapproval basically combine my file ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19056 ) with that of Daewootech ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:215 ) with some heavy modification.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\xE2\u20AC\u2122ve been playing with the design of the arms of the glasses. The original glasses had basic arms that you would just stick through holes, built into the frame. Sure, it worked, but it seemed to me like there was plenty of room for improvement.\r\nThe new glasses are designed to have the arms \xE2\u20AC\u0153grab\xE2\u20AC\x9D onto the glasses, with a slight \xE2\u20AC\u02DCsnap\xE2\u20AC\u2122 to it. Something that every engineer already knows: everything is a spring :)\r\n\r\nI may still refine the final clip, but I feel this is much better, and will even help prevent the arms from breaking, say if accidentally sat upon. Now the arms will just pop off the frames, instead of shattering everything.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nJUST WANT TO PURCHASE A PAIR?\r\n\r\nYou can still do that, over at my shop, The Plasmatorium:  http://www.etsy.com/shop/Plasmatorium"
