    okh:function """This is an experiment with different ways to connect multiple pieces of a model together. The model is a hollow sphere which has been split about 3/4 of the way along one axis. I then added different structures to reconnect the two pieces together. I put the male component on the larger piece of the sphere because that seemed more mechanically challenging.\r
\r
One model uses a simple peg-in-socket design. Nothing but friction holds the two pieces together, and I found that a difference of 0.5mm to 1.0mm in the diameters of the pegs and sockets gave good results with the vagaries of my printer.\r
\r
The other model uses a more sophisticated clip design with a half-sphere on one side, which mates to a similar socket on the cap. Here I found that a 3mm thick clip gives a good compromise between strength and flexibility.""" ;
