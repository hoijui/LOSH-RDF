\r
Thus was born the concept of the launchable cartoon rocket. This is the love-child of my Cartoon Rocket model ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15618 ) and the printable model rocket ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13616 ).\r
\r
I used the Cartoon Rocket as a basic design concept, and added the functional components to make it launchable: an engine mount, a nose cone which pops off easily, space for a parachute, a tube for the launch rod, and extra fins for stability.\r
\r
A word of warning!\r
\r
As of this writing, this rocket has not been launched. I have satisfied myself that it will launch safely and stably as long as you add enough ballast to the nose cone, but I don't know what will actually happen the first time it launches. Be sure to test the stability before you launch and follow all model rocket precautions. Launch at your own risk!""" ;
