    okh:function """My twin sons turned 10 today, and for their brithday party they wanted to organize an epic Nerf gun battle. They divided their friends into three teams, the Spartans, the Destroyers, and the Russians.\r
\r
We decided it would be fun to make team badges for each kid to wear. We stared with artwork found through Google Image Search, and using Photoshop, added text and borders and created greyscale heightmaps of the badges we wanted (white for thickest, black for outside the badge).\r
\r
The Heightmap to STL code ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15276 ) turned the 2D images into STL. We printed the badges 4-up for convenience, and different colors for different teams.""" ;
