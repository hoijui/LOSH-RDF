function = "Last year my cousin hand-built a timber frame cabin in the woods of Northern Minnesota. This one-room building has no water or electricity, just a wood burning stove and a sleeping loft with lots of blankets.\r\n\r\nThis model is made from a CAD model he constructed before starting the real thing. I printed it as a single piece, though it requires a lot of support--it should probably be printed in several pieces and glued together.\r\n\r\nHe now has this cabin as constructed using both primitive hand tools and the latest in modern 3D printing technology. Only one version is big enough to sleep in, however."
