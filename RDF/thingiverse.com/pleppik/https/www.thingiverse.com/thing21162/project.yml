function: "I recently bought a 30-lb reel of filament from Protoparadigm. This is much cheaper than buying the stuff a kilogram at a time, but there is no practical way to hang that size reel off the side of my printer.\r\n\r\nThus was born the Outrageously Overengineered Filament Stand. It consists of two towers, each topped with a ball bearing and a socket for an axle. An axle goes between the towers, and a pair of centering rings keep the reel centered on the axle.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is 100% 3D printed with no connectors, screws, or other components. Some ABS glue may be useful but isn't necessary.\r\n\r\nThe height of the towers, length of the axle, and diameter of the centering rings can vary to accommodate different size reels. I have used this with five different size reels."
