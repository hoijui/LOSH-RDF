    okh:function """Ever wonder why all the iris boxes on Thingiverse have five leaves?\r
\r
With six or more leaves, the leaves have to overlap each other when the box is opened. That requires a more complex leaf shape, but also opens up some interesting design possibilities.\r
\r
This 8-leaf iris box can be printed with the upper and lower parts of the leaves in contrasting colors. When the box is closed only the top part of the leaves are visible. As the box is opened the bottom piece is exposed. I printed this with black tops and yellow bottoms, and the effect in the pictures is striking.\r
\r
This model requires no screws or other hardware, though some glue may be needed to hold the two parts of the leaves together depending on the tolerances of your printer. All parts print without support.""" ;
