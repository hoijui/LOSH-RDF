function = "We used to have a cup full of pencils sitting next to the telephone in the kitchen. Very handy, except that we kept bumping the cup and spilling all the pens and pencils on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe solution: this wall-mounted holder. It has two slots for screws (or you can just set it on a desk), and compartments for pens, pencils, a notepad, and paperclips."
