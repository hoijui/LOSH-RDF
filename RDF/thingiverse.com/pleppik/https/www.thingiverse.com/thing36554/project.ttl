I will be posting a box and gift each day until Christmas. I will try to get each day's parts posted the night before, so you will have time to print it on the proper day.  



This Thing will eventually have all 25 days of parts. I will also post each day's parts as a derivative of this Thing, so there will be a convenient place for any "I Made One" posts of the daily pieces.  



THANKS TO EVERYONE who contributed ideas for things to make. I got a lot of great suggestions, and I wish I could have used them all. This calendar is my entry into ProtoParadigm's Winter Wonderland Contest. Wish me luck!
