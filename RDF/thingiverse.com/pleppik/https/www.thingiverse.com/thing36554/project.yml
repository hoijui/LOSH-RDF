function: "This advent calendar has (will have) a box for each of the 25 days in December through Christmas, and a small \"gift\" for each box. The boxes fit together to form the shape of a Christmas tree.  \n\n\n\nI will be posting a box and gift each day until Christmas. I will try to get each day's parts posted the night before, so you will have time to print it on the proper day.  \n\n\n\nThis Thing will eventually have all 25 days of parts. I will also post each day's parts as a derivative of this Thing, so there will be a convenient place for any \"I Made One\" posts of the daily pieces.  \n\n\n\nTHANKS TO EVERYONE who contributed ideas for things to make. I got a lot of great suggestions, and I wish I could have used them all. This calendar is my entry into ProtoParadigm's Winter Wonderland Contest. Wish me luck!  \n\n\n\nList of Gifts:  \n\nDay 1: Wrapped Present  \n\nDay 2: Wrapped Present (with a bow)  \n\nDay 3: Toboggan/sled  \n\nDay 4: X-Wing  \n\nDay 5: Toy Train  \n\nDay 6: Snowman  \n\nDay 7: Candle  \n\nDay 8: Mug (of hot cocoa, coffee, tea, etc.)  \n\nDay 9: Church With Steeple  \n\nDay 10: Igloo  \n\nDay 11: Gingerbread House  \n\nDay 12: Makerbot Replicator 2  \n\nDay 13: Christmas Tree  \n\nDay 14: Gingerbread Man  \n\nDay 15: Bell  \n\nDay 16: Candycane  \n\nDay 17: Tardis  \n\nDay 18: Snowflake  \n\nDay 19: Santa Hat  \n\nDay 20: Toy Drum  \n\nDay 21: Burning Logs  \n\nDay 22: Plate of Cookies  \n\nDay 23: Festivus Pole  \n\nDay 24: Toy Rocket  \n\nDay 25: Star"
