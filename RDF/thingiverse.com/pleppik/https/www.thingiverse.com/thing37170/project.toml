function = "Igloo\r\n\r\nThe iGloo is famous for its minimalist, highly functional design. Available in only one color, and designed with only a single entry, the iGloo is easy for even the novice user to understand.\r\n\r\nCompetitors have responded by offering homes with ever more doors and windows. Fans of the iGloo remain loyal, however, insisting that a single door is all anyone really needs, and that additional entryways simply detract from the clean design aesthetic."
