function = "Why spend $6 for a new bottle when you can use your own Brita filter to refill your 5 gallon water cooler bottle? When I tried to do this without a support collar I would have to hold the filter the whole time since the diameter of the bottom of the filter and the top of the bottle are close to the same (52 and 55mm). Just place the collar on the bottle about 1/3 of the way and the filter system on top 2/3. This works perfectly with no leakage. Enjoy!"
