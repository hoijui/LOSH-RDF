The MOTORBOAT is developed from zero and it is not based on any model previously developed by other programmers. We only use the code .SCAD of a propeller, to build our propeller (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8688 ).\r\n\r\nHere is a video of the MOTORBOAT (in spanish): \r\nPulleys:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/dUqTDfMHCe8\r\nGears:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/C185LOEoUI0\r\n\r\nTest in water:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/0xFm2y-97Ts\r\n\r\nAll code is written by QtCreator program, this program can work in parallel with OpenScan program order to view the process of developing of the different parts.\r\n\r\nThe MOTORBOAT was divided into three parts. The first part is the physical structure of the MOTORBOAT and is intended to float on water. The second part is based on mechanical system pulleys and belt and is intended to transmit power to the propeller. The third part is based on other mechanical system gears and also aims to transmit power to the propeller.\r\n\r\nThe gear code has been parameterized to function as a new library OOML.\r\n\r\nTo supply power to the mechanical system we used a motor DC that is activated or deactivated through a switch.\r\n\r\nFinally, the attached codes are. \"STL\" files. It also includes a \".RAR\" file which includes all the generated files (.\"CPP\", .\"SCAD\", .\"STL\").\r\n\r\nAdditional things.\r\nTo assemble the physical structure of the motorboat, we need:\r\nWaterproof adhesive. \r\n2  flange to hold the motor.\r\nTo assemble the mechanical system based on pulleys and belts, we need:\r\n2  M3x10mm screws.\r\n10  M3 washer.\r\n2  M3  nuts.\r\n1  square section belt 80Ã˜x2.2mm.\r\nTo assemble the mechanical system based on gears, we need:\r\n2  M3x10mm screws.\r\n2  M3x20mm screws.\r\n2  M3  nuts.\r\n14  M3 washer."
