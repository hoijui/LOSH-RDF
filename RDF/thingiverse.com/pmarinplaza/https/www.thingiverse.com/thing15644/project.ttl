In order to improve the tool OOML (iearobotics.com/oomlwiki/doku.php), we built this motorboat from libraries OOML whose they are written in C++. The MOTORBOAT is developed from zero and it is not based on any model previously developed by other programmers. We only use the code .SCAD of a propeller, to build our propeller (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8688 ).\r
\r
Here is a video of the MOTORBOAT (in spanish): \r
Pulleys:\r

Gears:\r

\r
Test in water:\r

\r
All code is written by QtCreator program, this program can work in parallel with OpenScan program order to view the process of developing of the different parts.\r
\r
The MOTORBOAT was divided into three parts. The first part is the physical structure of the MOTORBOAT and is intended to float on water. The second part is based on mechanical system pulleys and belt and is intended to transmit power to the propeller. The third part is based on other mechanical system gears and also aims to transmit power to the propeller.\r
\r
The gear code has been parameterized to function as a new library OOML.\r
\r
To supply power to the mechanical system we used a motor DC that is activated or deactivated through a switch.\r
\r
Finally, the attached codes are. "STL" files. It also includes a ".RAR" file which includes all the generated files (."CPP", ."SCAD", ."STL").\r
\r
Additional things.\r
To assemble the physical structure of the motorboat, we need:\r
Waterproof adhesive. \r
2  flange to hold the motor.\r
To assemble the mechanical system based on pulleys and belts, we need:\r
2  M3x10mm screws.\r
10  M3 washer.\r
2  M3  nuts.\r
1  square section belt 80Ã˜x2.2mm.\r
To assemble the mechanical system based on gears, we need:\r
2  M3x10mm screws.\r
2  M3x20mm screws.\r
2  M3  nuts.\r
14  M3 washer.""" ;
