function = "This is not a photo, it's a snapshot of the 3D model. There is one of 2D photos I used for 3D reconstructions below.\r\n\r\nI was travelling in China and scanned this part of the ancient water drainage with my photo camera. I am still wondering if it was a dragon, an elephant or a crocodile. \r\n\r\nYou can find it in the Summer Garden of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China and figure out yourself.\r\n\r\nAttached STL is a shell with no scale. It may need repair, etc.\r\n\r\nI wish someone of this talented community could find a good use of this model in pretty dull CAD designed devices. I cannot figure out anything exciting than a hook.\r\n\r\nI have more 3D scans from China. Let me know if Thingiverse people want more replicas of Chinese art."
