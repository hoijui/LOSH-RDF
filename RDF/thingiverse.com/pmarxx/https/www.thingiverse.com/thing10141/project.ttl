\r
I was travelling in China and scanned this part of the ancient water drainage with my photo camera. I am still wondering if it was a dragon, an elephant or a crocodile. \r
\r
You can find it in the Summer Garden of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China and figure out yourself.\r
\r
Attached STL is a shell with no scale. It may need repair, etc.\r
\r
I wish someone of this talented community could find a good use of this model in pretty dull CAD designed devices. I cannot figure out anything exciting than a hook.\r
\r
I have more 3D scans from China. Let me know if Thingiverse people want more replicas of Chinese art.""" ;
