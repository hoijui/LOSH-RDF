\r
I just liked the sculpture which is quite brutal. I like Mayakovskiy as well.\r
\r
Since Mayakovski committed a suicide in 1930 ( I could be mistaken with a date), I made auxiliary model with poor guyâ€™s head blowing away. I am afraid tiny scull connectors may not be possible to replicate.""" ;
