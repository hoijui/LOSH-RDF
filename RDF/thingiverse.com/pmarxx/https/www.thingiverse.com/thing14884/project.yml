function: "This is actually a photoscan of a bust of a Russian poet Mayakovski. The original is located in central Moscow. It\xE2\u20AC\u2122s funny but the bust and the museum are embedded in a newly build former KGB buildings.  The museum is actually located in KGB! \r\n\r\nI just liked the sculpture which is quite brutal. I like Mayakovskiy as well.\r\n\r\nSince Mayakovski committed a suicide in 1930 ( I could be mistaken with a date), I made auxiliary model with poor guy\xE2\u20AC\u2122s head blowing away. I am afraid tiny scull connectors may not be possible to replicate."
