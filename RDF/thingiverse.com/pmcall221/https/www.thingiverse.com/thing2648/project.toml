function = "This is the logo for Pumping Station: One.  It is a medallion for a necklace or a give-a-way for guests.  I am currently trying to build a reprap machine for the hackerspace and would love for this to be the first object it prints.  This could also be made with a laser cutter too if you modify the stl.  Maybe even white acrylic and call it a snowflake and make Christmas ornaments out of it.  Feel free to print one out before I do.  Let me know how it goes.\r\n\r\nwww.pumpingstationone.org"
