    okh:function """This is a baby rattle that should be able to be printed out on a makerbot.  Has a small sphere in the middle of the ball that needs to be broken off for it to rattle.  I have attached the DWG and DXF files along with the STL. I don't have a 3D printer but this should work.  \r
\r
Please let me know how it prints. I am waiting on my Makerbot and I would love to know if the design need changing.\r
\r
The hole in the top is decorative and functional. Increases rattling sound and is used to break off the sphere in the middle much like the whistle.  The hole was designed to fit a 6 cm Leatherman blade into the ball to dislodge the rattler.""" ;
