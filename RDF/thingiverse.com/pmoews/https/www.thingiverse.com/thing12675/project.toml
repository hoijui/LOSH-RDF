function = "Here's a simple molecular modeling program written in OPENscad.  It's a derivative of the OPENscad program in \"Protein Models\".  It contains two modules, \"atom\" and \"bond\".  A call to atom makes a sphere and a call to bond makes a cylinder.  Atom requires a radius and a set of atomic coordinates; bond requires two sets of atomic coordinates.  For example to make a water molecule we could write:\r\n\r\natom (.3, 0, 0, 0);  // an Oxygen at the origin, .3 for its radius \r\natom (.25, -.96, 0, 0); // for the first H atom, .25 for its radius\r\natom (.25, .24, .93, 0); // for the second H atom\r\nbond (0,0,0,-.96,0,0);         // for the first O-H bond\r\nbond (0,0,0,.24,.93.0);       // for the second o-H bond\r\n\r\nTo render it all together the above commands are included within a union statement.  More details in makewater.scad.\r\n\r\nOnce I had this program I began looking for coordinates of interesting molecules to print.  I found a collection of fullerenes at   http://www.ccl.net/cca/data/fullerenes/index.shtml  Better known as \"Buckyballs\" you can read about the fullerenes on Wikipedia.  The buckyball most discussed contains 60 carbon atoms but the coordinate collection has a range of sizes, from 20 to 540 atms."
