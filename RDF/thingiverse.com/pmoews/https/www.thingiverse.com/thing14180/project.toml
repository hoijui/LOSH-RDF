function = "Here are two medallions for Christmas made with openSCAD.  Printed directly on the build platform the two might be glued together to serve as a small Christmas ornament.  As given below they are about 40 mm wide and 50 mm long.\r\n\r\nMedallion_1.stl is a Christmas tree done with circles and a star at the top.  The circles are centered at the vertices of a hexagonal grid with the radii of the circles twice the length of the side of the hexagons to make what is supposed to be a pleasing pattern.\r\n\r\nMedallion_2.stl shows four Christmas trees whose tops meet at the center.  The  pattern was plotted on a 30 by 30 square array, a bit map, and transferred to the medallion."
