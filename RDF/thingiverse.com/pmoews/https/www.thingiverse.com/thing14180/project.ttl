\r
Medallion_1.stl is a Christmas tree done with circles and a star at the top.  The circles are centered at the vertices of a hexagonal grid with the radii of the circles twice the length of the side of the hexagons to make what is supposed to be a pleasing pattern.\r
\r
Medallion_2.stl shows four Christmas trees whose tops meet at the center.  The  pattern was plotted on a 30 by 30 square array, a bit map, and transferred to the medallion.""" ;
