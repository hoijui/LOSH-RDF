function: "I like the cat bust by SteveCooley.  With its small ears it looks like an Egyptian cat representation. I downloaded it and found that it was perfectly sized to fit into an ornament frame from a previous post.  When I tried to modify it in openSCAD I received a \"winding error\".  After sending the stl file to netfabb Studio's cloud and cutting a sliver off the bottom the winding error disappeared.  The file smallcathead_fixed(Cut 2).stl can be imported into an openSCAD program.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed the ornament to my daughter she said: \"Very nice.  It would look good as a bust.\""
