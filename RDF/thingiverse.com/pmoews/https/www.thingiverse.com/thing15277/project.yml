function: "This ornament makes use of one of the fonts introduced with the openSCAD  release of December 29, 2011  -\r\n\r\n    see More Fontz by polymaker at thingiverse - thing:13677\r\n\r\nThe ornament is labeled on the outside with HAPPY HAPPY and on the inside with JOY JOY - the openings are designed to make JOY JOY visible - HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY are the lyrics to a Ren and Stimpy song of the same name. The ornament is purely decorative and meant to illustrate the use of the newly available fonts.  However it could be used to hold paper clips if printed in a larger size. \r\n\r\nIt's constructed from a polyhedron with 16 faces.  While not a regular    polyhedron it is an attractive one.  It consists of two regular heptagons joined by 14 trapezoids and is simple enough so that the rotations and translations required to joint the text to the figure can easily be calculated.  I've included some explanatory comments with the openSCAD code."
