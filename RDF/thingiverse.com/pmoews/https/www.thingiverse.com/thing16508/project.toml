function = "Johnson polyhedra have faces composed of regular polygons: triangles, squares, pentagons,hexagons, octagons and decagons. There are only 92 such polyhedra. Instructions for making paper models are available, but with stl files one could print more durable examples.  \nI recently came across the netlib library of polyhedra at  \nhttp://netlib.sandia.gov/polyhedra/  \nwhich includes the Johnson polyhedra.  I was pleased to see that it would be easy to convert the files to openSCAD polyhedron comands. Polyhedron commands are  \na compact way of describing a polyhedron and, when executed, output an stl file.  \nI wrote a fortran program to convert the files; however a few files had errors. I had corrected most errors with openSCAD's unusual, but marvelous, \"thrown together\" mode when I was informed that the errors had already been noticed and corrected by George Hart  \nhttp://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/netlib-info.html  \nThere is a link on the George Hart page to a set of VRML files which display the Johnson polyhedra with color coded faces. References are also given.  \nUsing the corrected files I was able to finish the conversion.  You will find the 92 scad files in Johnson_Scad_Files.zip and the 92 stl files in Johnson_Stl_Files.zip.  \nTo get a large version of the polyhedra it is best to print a hollow structure. Five examples of hollow polyhedra stl files are included here together with a sample openSCAD file, hollow_j03.scad."
