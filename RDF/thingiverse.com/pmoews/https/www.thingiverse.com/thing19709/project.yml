function: "Here are five of the thirteen Archimedean solids - see thing:19168 and thing:19314 for the other eight.  They are:.\r\n\r\n1) snub cube, 2) truncated dodecahedron, 3) truncated cuboctahedron, 4) rhombicosidodecahedron, and 5) truncated icosidodecahedron.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive pairs of stl files are available for download.  The first two pairs, like the eight previous ones, have two types of faces.  They are:\r\n\r\nsnub_cube_less_faces.stl and snub_cube_faces.stl\r\ntrunc_dodecahedron_less_faces.stl and trunc_dodecahedron_faces.stl\r\n\r\nThe final 3 solids have three types of faces; not so good for two color printing.  The stl files included below color the faces with the largest areas.  The pairs are:\r\n\r\ntrunc_cuboctahedron_less_faces8.stl and trunc_cuboctahedron_faces8.stl\r\nrhombicosidodecahedron_less_faces5.stl and rhombicosidodecahedron_faces5.stl\r\ntrunc_icosidodecahedron_less_faces10.stl and trunc_icosidodecahedron_faces10.stl\r\n\r\nAn image of the 5 solids that these files produce is shown at the upper left.  The green faces are on the solids with three types of faces.\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD files are collected in 2color_archi3_scad.zip and the stl files that they produced are in 2color_archi3_stl.zip. Files to print the smaller faces of the solids with three types of faces are included in 2color_archi3_stl.zip.  An image that shows each of the faces of the truncated cuboctahedron and the truncated icosidodecahedron colored in turn is shown at the left."
