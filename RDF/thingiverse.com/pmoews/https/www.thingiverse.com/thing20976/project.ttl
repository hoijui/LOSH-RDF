    okh:function """Here is a simple container that encloses a sliding drawer like a box of matches.  It can be decorated with one of three different repeating patterns.  Two are textile patterns and the third is an array of Pascal triangles.\r
\r
For monochrome printers the patterns are embossed on the surface and for two color printers the embossed pattern can be in a different color.  Stl files for two versions are provided.  A second textile pattern is included in the zip files.\r
\r
The patterns were created with openSCAD's polyhedron command which makes them easy to manipulate.\r
\r
For those who know openSCAD the programs consist of about a dozen lines of code that include a call to a pattern module. Any module that makes a pattern lying on the xy plane can be substituted to make a custom box. The scad files are available in box_scad.zip and the stl files in box_stl.zip.""" ;
