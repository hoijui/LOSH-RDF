function = "Here is a simple slide box where the length, width, and depth can be set in the generating openSCAD file.  It is only semi-parametric as the wall thickness is fixed at 2 mm and the slide slot is 3 mm wide to accept a 2 mm thick lid.  The image at the left shows a collection of boxes.\r\n\r\nThe lid is a simple 2 mm thick rectangle that lies flat on the build surface.  This is the position where a dual strusion machine should work best.  The lid was used as a base for a number of decorations. One, shown in the image at the lower left, is a scanned Gerbera daisy petal repeatedly duplicated to approximate the original flower.\r\n\r\nMost of the boxes are 50 mm wide and 60 mm long but vary in height so that they accept the same lid.  The stl file, parametric_box.stl, makes such a box 30 mm high.  Three lids are provided, a parametric one, a 2 mm rectangle with a raised image of the Gerbera daisy, and the same raised image in two colors.  OpenSCAD files for the parametric box and lid are below. The two zip files, box_scad.zip and box_stl.zip contain all the scad and stl files. The zip files include four additional two color lids: a holly leaf, a geranium leaf, a Japanese Crest and a pattern of diamonds."
