function: "Here are parametric openSCAD files that create chairs and tables.  Objects from a few millimeters across to full size chairs and tables can be built.  The programs are probably best suited for making small models for dioramas. More amusing than useful perhaps but it is interesting to quickly construct a succession of different tables and chairs. For example the chair can be widened to make a bench or lengthened to make a bed.\r\n\r\nYou need openSCAD to make full use of the parametric files.  OpenSCAD is easy to download and install.  It includes an editor that can be used to vary the input parameters in the scad files.\r\n\r\nFor the table:\r\n\r\nThere are 5 settable parameters; 3 are the length, width, and depth of the top.  The legs are square in cross section and the side length of the square and the length of the leg are the 2 additional variables.\r\n\r\nFor the chair:\r\n\r\nThere are 9 settable parameters. The table forms the seat and legs of the chair so 5 of the variables are the same as the variables for the table.  The back of the chair has three vertical members and two horizontal members.  Two variables set the width of these members.  The final two parameters set the height of the chair back and the height of the legs that connect to the seat of the chair.  Actually the chair back has two additional parameters but they are constrained by the values used for the seat.\r\n\r\nFour stl files are provided: chair.stl, bench.stl, bed,stl and table.stl.  Printed versions are shown in the image at the upper left.\r\n\r\nTwo parametric scad files are included: chair.scad and table.scad.  Parameters for bench.stl and bed.stl are included as comments at the end of chair.scad."
