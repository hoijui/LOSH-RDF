function: "J.J. Thomson (1904) asked: How do a small number of electrons arrange themselves on the surface of a unit sphere?  Solutions have been proposed for cases where the number of electrons varies from 2 to 400 and beyond.  However few solutions have been proved to be optimal.\r\n\r\nTwo types of polyhedra are useful for those working on the problem; the convex hull and its dual.  A nice applet from Syracuse University shows virtual versions of these polyhedra.\r\n\r\n(Run http://thomson.phy.syr.edu/thomsonapplet.php\r\nType n = 11 into the applet and press start - one can then alternate between the convex hull, \"mesh\", and its dual, \"dual\".)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to print physical versions of these polyhedra and it was suggested to me that qhull - http://www.qhull.org/ - outputs these polyhedra in a simple format called OFF. I was able to write a program that coverts OFF format to openSCAD polyhedron commands.\r\n\r\nCoordinates for possible solutions to the Thomson problem are available at The Cambridge Cluster Database  http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/~wales/CCD/Thomson/table.html Solutions for n=10, 11, 13, and 14 were downloaded and converted to polyhedron commands.\r\n\r\nAdditionally an openSCAD program used to make Christmas ornaments, thing:14337, needed little modification to show the positions of the electrons as stars on the surface of a sphere.  Spheres decorated with possible solutions for n = 10, 11, 13 and 14 were calculated.\r\n\r\nThe following STL files are provided:\r\n\r\nSolution_Sphere_N11.stl\r\nConvex_Hull_N11.stl\r\nConvex_Hull_Dual_N11.stl\r\n\r\nThe image at the left shows printed versions of these files.\r\n\r\nThe stl files are in Thomson_polyhedra_stl.zip.\r\nAll the SCAD files and the FORTRAN program used to make the polyhedron commands are in Thomson_polyhedra_programs.zip."
