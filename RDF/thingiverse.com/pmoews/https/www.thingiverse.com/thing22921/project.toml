function = "Here is an Inuit soapstone carving; a souvenir from the 1967 World's Fair in Montreal.  See the image at the lower left.\r\n\r\nIt was converted to an stl file with Autodesk's 123D Catch.  123D Catch is currently a free beta.  One supplies a number of pictures and the program converts them into a 3D image.\r\n\r\nAn stl file, seal_two.stl, is available below.  When the file is printed a 0.4 scale copy of the carving is produced.  See the image at the upper left."
