function = "This pig is based on a lawn ornament.  It might better be called an ugly pig with a crumpled ear. See image at the left.\r\n\r\nTwo stl files are provided: a half size version, and a full version.  Both are hollow with a wall thickness of just over 1 mm.\r\n\r\nThe full version has a hole in the bottom to allow filling with sand or plaster of Paris. Its volume is about 575 cc but since it is hollow the maximum amount of material used is 40 ccs."
