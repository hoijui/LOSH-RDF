\r
Two stl files are provided: a half size version, and a full version.  Both are hollow with a wall thickness of just over 1 mm.\r
\r
The full version has a hole in the bottom to allow filling with sand or plaster of Paris. Its volume is about 575 cc but since it is hollow the maximum amount of material used is 40 ccs.""" ;
