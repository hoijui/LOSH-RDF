function = "A souvenir from the German enclave in Switzerland bought, I believe, in the spring of 1970.  Simply carved, with visible cuts, it still gives a good impression of a rabbit.  If you look closely you will see that the rabbit is scratching itself with its right hind foot.\r\n\r\nTwo full size versions are provided, one is hollow with 1.4 mm walls."
