function = "Some years ago I bought a caterpillar composed of\r\nhexagonal nuts welded together.  It was made by Rock Creek Metal Craft.  Rock Creek is still in business - see www.rockcreekmetalcraft.com - but now makes more elaborate art work.  Hex_caterpillar.stl is an openSCAD version of a caterpillar made from pierced hexagons.\r\n\r\nA second caterpillar model, caterpillar.stl, uses only spheres and cylinders.  It is meant to resemble a great peacock moth caterpillar.\r\n\r\nBoth openSCAD programs are semi-parametric and one can change the size and placement of the caterpillar parts to perhaps make something more pleasing"
