function: "Baby_Brownie_Special.stl is a full size digital copy of Kokak's little camera; first manufactured in 1938.  More information is available at the camerapedia wikia -\r\n camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Kodak_Baby_Brownie_Special\r\n\r\nThe Baby Brownie Special is made of bakelite and has a black reflective surface; properties that the directions for 123D Catch suggest be avoided.  The camera was dipped in a dilute mixture of water and fine flour.  When the mixture dried it left a thin crazed white coat that was easily handed by the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Piggy Bank\" is a hollow version with a slit in the top and fittings for a plug in the base: BB_piggy_bank.stl and piggy_bank_plug.stl."
