function = "Some experiments attempting to make political buttons are described here.  The buttons consist of a 2 mm thick circular plate rounded at the edges to hide a mounting pin.  A number 2 safety pin held in place by two short pieces of 1.75 mm filament is used to mount the button on clothing.\r\n\r\nA 1 mm deep message is inscribed in the surface of the button.  The recesses can be left unfilled or, if a two color printer is available, filled with a different color.  As an alternative the recesses can be filled with air drying clay.\r\n\r\nThe image shows buttons filled with ABS (red characters}, clay (blue characters) or left unfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pairs of stl files for 2 color printing are:\r\n\r\nbutton_vote.stl\r\nmessage_vote.stl\r\n\r\nbutton_no_vote.stl\r\nmessage_no_vote.stl\r\n\r\nbutton_obama.stl\r\nmessage_obama.stl\r\n\r\nbutton_romney.stl\r\nmessage_romney.stl\r\n\r\n\r\nThe open SCAD programs that created the files are buttons.scad and messages.scad.  One of Polymakers fonts, DroidSerif_Bold.scad, was used to write the messages - see More Fontz by Polymaker - thing:13677.  All of these files are included in Buttons.zip"
