function = "These buttons are supposed to be improved versions of the ones described in thing:25184, Political Buttons.  The new versions are shown in the image at the top left.\r\n\r\nA thinner, more elegant font, Architects Daugher - thing:13677, was used and the buttons are slightly smaller. It's now easier to change the name of the politician.  Open Political_Buttons.scad in open SCAD's editor and look at the messages near the end of the file.  Substitute your candidates name for Obama, Romney, or Ron Paul and generate the stl file.\r\n\r\nThe new font makes it possible to make a button containing a short message and one such button is included here.  It has an old saying attributed to the Navy - \"When in Danger or in Doubt Run in Circles Scream and Shout\"\r\n\r\nThe image at the lower left shows the buttons after the recesses have been filled with air drying clay."
