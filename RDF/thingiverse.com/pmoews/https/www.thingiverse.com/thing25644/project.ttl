    okh:function """Here are two souvenir rabbits.  One is a star gazing rabbit probably from Wales.  It's claimed that moon and star gazing rabbit stories are ancient but there seems little evidence to support this idea - possibly a ploy to sell rabbits.  The stone rabbit is a souvenir of Canada; it is almost certaintly a reproduction.\r
\r
Both rabbits were scanned in with 123D Catch which does a surprisingly good job on these small objects. The star gazing rabbit is 75 mm high and the stone rabbit 65 mm long.""" ;
