function = "Here is a fire hydrant on Pinta Street in Oceanside, California.  It was digitized with 123D Catch - the chains designed to capture the caps were deleted as they were too thin to print well.  The hydrant is about 700 mm tall so this is an approximately one seventh scale model.\r\n\r\nThe image at the lower left shows the actual hydrant.  You can also see it in Google Earth.  Fly to \"Pinta St. Oceanside, CA\" , zoom in and change to Street View.  The hydrant is near the juncture with Isabella Drive."
