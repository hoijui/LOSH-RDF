function = "Here are three succulents growing in my garden.  They were effectively \"plucked\" out of the ground with Autocad's 123D Catch and Meshmixer.  Whether this is a useful exercise or not is a question but the programs are capable of producing extremely detailed replicas.  These three examples were done using the lowest resolution available; higher resolutions produce details which the printer cannot reproduce.\r\n\r\nSmall succulents with thick leaves were chosen.  All are presented at full size.  They are:\r\n\r\nHaworthia_attenuata.stl\r\nEcheveria_hybrid.stl\r\nEuphorbia_lactea_cristata.stl\r\n\r\nImages comparing the models to the actual plants are shown at the lower left."
