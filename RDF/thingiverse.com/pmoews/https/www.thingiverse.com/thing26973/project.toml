function = "Here are some decorated disks for a two color printer.  The disks print in a few minutes and the openSCAD program provided can be modified to quickly try out ideas for two color prints.  The patterns extend completely through the disks which are only 2.5 mm thick. The disks might serve as refrigerator magnets, math teaching tools, earings, or mobiles.\r\n\r\nTwelve of the images are derived from plane curves.  They are:\r\n\r\ncardioid\r\ncatenary\r\nevolute of ellipse\r\nsine\r\nthree-leaved rose\r\nstrophoid\r\nwitch of agnesi\r\nlemniscate of bernoulli\r\nlimacon\r\nparabola\r\ncubical parabola\r\nsemicubical parabola\r\n\r\nYou will find much information about all of these curves on the internet.\r\n\r\n Pairs of stl files for 3 of the disks are included below:\r\n\r\ndisk_less_evolute.stl and evolute.stl\r\ndisk_less_witch.stl and witch.stl\r\ndisk_less_sine.stl and sine.stl\r\n\r\nDecorated_disks_stl.zip contains all 14 pairs of stl files."
