function = "The Tantalus cup works normally if it is partially filled.  If filled to the brim most of the liquid siphons out through the bottom.  It is also called a  Pythagorean cup.\r\n\r\nThing:17330 by Scooter46290 is a such a cup with a simple but elegant siphon composed of three concentric cones about a central tube.  Here is another version where the siphon is concealed in the stem.  It has the advantage that the siphon has a greater head and can more completely empty the cup.   Open scad and stl files are provided."
