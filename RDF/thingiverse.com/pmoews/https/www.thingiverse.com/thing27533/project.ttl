\r
Thing:17330 by Scooter46290 is a such a cup with a simple but elegant siphon composed of three concentric cones about a central tube.  Here is another version where the siphon is concealed in the stem.  It has the advantage that the siphon has a greater head and can more completely empty the cup.   Open scad and stl files are provided.""" ;
