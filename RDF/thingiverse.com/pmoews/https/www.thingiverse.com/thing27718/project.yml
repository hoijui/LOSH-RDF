function: "The rotate_extrude command in openSCAD has fascinating posibilities.  It can replace the potters wheel and the woodworkers lathe.  All one has to do is draw a 2 dimensional profile of a clay pot or wooden bowl, convert it to a polygon, invoke rotate_extrude and a pot or bowl is produced.\r\n\r\nHere is a parametric program that uses the rotate_extrude command to make wine glasses, glasses, and bowls.  Examples outputs are given below:\r\n\r\n1. wine_glass.stl\r\n2. drink_cup_5oz.stl\r\n3. small_bowl.stl\r\n4. cat_food_dish.stl\r\n\r\nThe parameters that produced the above outputs are appended as comments to the openSCAD program make_wine_glass.scad."
