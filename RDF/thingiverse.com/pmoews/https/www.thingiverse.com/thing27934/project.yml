function: "I find these coin-pendants a pleasing way to display the plane curves from thing:26973, Decorative Disks.  The coins have milled edges and curves on each face.  They can be used as key fobs or pendants and are about the size of checker pieces.\r\n\r\nThe coins can be printed without holes or with two different types of holes.  A hole through the face of the coin makes it suitable for use as a key fob.  A hole through the edge allows a ribbon to be threaded through making the coin a pendant. See the image at the upper left.\r\n\r\nThree pairs of stl files for two color printers are provided.\r\nThey are:\r\n\r\n1) a key fob with devil and witch of agnesi curves -\r\ncoin_less_devil_witch.stl and devil_witch.stl\r\n\r\n2) a pendant with 7 cusped hypocycloid and epicycloids -\r\ncoin_less_hypo_epicycloid.stl and hypo_epicycloid.stl\r\n\r\n3) a simple disk with no holes -\r\ncoin_less_devil_form_evolute.stl and devil_form_evolute.stl\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD program that produces the coins is included below.  There are hundreds of types of coins possible as most of the plane curve modules have adjustable parameters."
