function: "The plane curves and projections that were used to decorate disks and coins,(see thing:28301 and thing:27934), can also be used to ornament tetrahedra.  These tetrahedra, with raised patterns on their faces, make attractive paper weights and desk ornaments.\r\n\r\nTetrahedra are well suited for printing as they slope inwards and provide a nice surface for elevated patterns.  The patterns are raised about 2 mm from the faces of the tetrahedra. Three patterns can be displayed at a time; four if a recessed pattern is added to the base.\r\n\r\nSix tetrahedra which display 21 different patterns are provided.  Three show plane curves and three show fullerene projections.\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD programs that produced the stl files are tetra_plane_curves.scad and tetra_bucky.scad and they are included below."
