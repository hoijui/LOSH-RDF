function = "Here are a set of Platonic dice.  Five stl files and the five openSCAD programs that created them are provided.  Each openSCAD program contains a module that makes a rounded Platonic solid.  Variables are an overall scale factor and a radius for rounding.  One of polymakers fonts, thing:13677, ArchitectsDaughter, was used to label the surfaces.\r\n\r\nDice are a popular topic on Thingiverse.  A search using \"dice\" yielded nearly a hundred hits. Most of the dice have sharp edges but thing:29055 by KillerGardevoir is a nicely rounded set which rolls well.  As the rounding radius of the Platonic dice is increased a point is reached where they resemble KillerGardevoir's dice.  Further increases turn the Platonic dice into near spheres."
