    okh:function """Here are the 92 Johnson Polyhedron-Dual Compounds.  The openSCAD files are collected in Johnson_Compounds_Scad.zip and a selection of the stl files is in Johnson_Compounds_Stl.zip.\r
\r
The dual stl files described in thing:32101 were converted to polyhedron commands to speed computation.\r
\r
The Johnson polyhedra are varied, some are not very symmetric, and in fact some of the compounds are ugly.  However 8 of the Johnson polyhedra have vertices\r
which are equidistant from the origin, (J27, J34, J37, J72, J73, J74, J75, and J80), and their compounds resemble the Archimedean-Catalan compounds.\r
\r
Elongated Johnson polyhedral compounds often have interesting belts or end caps.  Attractive ones are: J35, J38, J42, J43, J46, and J48.  The truncated cubes and dodecahedrons, J66, J67, J68, and J69 are fairly attractive and should make nice 2 color prints.  The rhombicosidodecahedrons, J76, J77, J78, and J79 are interesting compounds with a single downward spike.\r
\r
Sample stl files are:\r
\r
compound_J27.stl\r
compound_j34.stl\r
compound_J37.stl\r
compound_J74.stl\r
compound_j35.stl\r
compound_j38.stl\r
compound_j67.stl\r
compound_j68.stl""" ;
