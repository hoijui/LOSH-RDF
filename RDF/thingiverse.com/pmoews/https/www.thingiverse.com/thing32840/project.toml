function = "Here are two containers created with the openSCAD code from Decorating Spheres: thing:31343. One is 60 mm in diameter and one 70 mm.  They might serve to hold paper clips or rubber bands.  The smaller one comes in monochrome and two color versions.\r\n\r\nFour stl files are provided:\r\n\r\ncontainer_sphere_two_hundred.stl   - the 70 mm diameter container\r\ncontainer_sphere_five.stl          - the 60 mm diameter container\r\ncontainer_color_body.stl           - file 1 for the two color version\r\ncontainer_color_decorations.stl    - file 2 for the two color version\r\n\r\nThe holes in the 70 mm container were positioned using coordinates available from The Cambridge Cluster Database.\r\nSee:\r\nhttp://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/~wales/CCD/Thomson/table.html\r\nCoordinates at the database represent possible solutions to the Thomson problem.  The solution for n = 200 was used to locate the holes in container_sphere_two_hundred.stl."
