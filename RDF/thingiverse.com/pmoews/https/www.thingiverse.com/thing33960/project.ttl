    okh:function """This ornament is meant to resemble a German blown glass decoration popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.  The ornament was made by pressing a softened glass bubble against a form leaving a round geometric indentation.  The indentation was silvered making a reflective surface called a "witch's eye".\r
\r
In an attempt to duplicate the glass ornament portions of a polyhedron were subtracted from a sphere to make three indentations.  A thin layer of material was added to the sphere surface so that the ornament could have two colors.  A connector was placed at the top.\r
\r
The ornament lacks the reflective surfaces that created the "witch's eyes".  Perhaps a bit of silver paint would make it more attractive.""" ;
