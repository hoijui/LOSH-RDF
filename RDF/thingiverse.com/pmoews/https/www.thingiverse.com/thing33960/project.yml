function: "This ornament is meant to resemble a German blown glass decoration popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.  The ornament was made by pressing a softened glass bubble against a form leaving a round geometric indentation.  The indentation was silvered making a reflective surface called a \"witch's eye\".\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to duplicate the glass ornament portions of a polyhedron were subtracted from a sphere to make three indentations.  A thin layer of material was added to the sphere surface so that the ornament could have two colors.  A connector was placed at the top.\r\n\r\nThe ornament lacks the reflective surfaces that created the \"witch's eyes\".  Perhaps a bit of silver paint would make it more attractive."
