function: "Here is openSCAD code to make Sierpinski triangles and carpets.  You can read about Sierpinski's work on Wikipedia or Wolfram Math.  I like the article by Sylvie Champeaux at:\r\n\r\nhttp://hmf.enseeiht.fr/travaux/CD9900/travaux/optmfn/hi/00pa/mfn03/champeau.htm\r\n\r\nwhich explains how the Chaos Game leads to a Sierpinski triangle.\r\n\r\nSierpinski_triangle.stl is an ornament with a hole for hanging.  The openSCAD code produced 81 separate triangles which were subtracted from a single triangle to make the ornament.\r\n\r\nSierpinski_carpet.stl is a carpet after three cycles of iteration.\r\n\r\nComposite_carpet.stl is a composite of 3 carpets at different stages of iteration.\r\n\r\nSierpinski_all.stl is a carpet where the central square has been replaced by a triangle.\r\n\r\nThe triangles and carpets are limited to 3 or 4 iterations here; attempts to go further ran into openSCAD program limitations.  Note that Polymaker, (thing:8711), has created an attractive three dimensional version of the triangle."
