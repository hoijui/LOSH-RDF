function: "Here are two recursive snowflakes, one composed entirely of hexagons, the second of hypocycloids.\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD code that produced them was supplied to me by D J Moews who kindly allowed me to post it here under the attribution creative commons license.\r\n\r\nBoth snowflakes have hexagonal symmetry; the hypocycloids having 6 cusps.  The two snowflakes are similar but the one composed of hypocycloids is slightly more open. However it takes much longer to calculate."
