function = "Some of the Johnson Compounds (see thing:32445, Johnson Polyhedron_Dual Compounds) make interesting two color ornaments.  As they are a combination of two polyhedra they are easy to construct, one polyhedron per color.  One limitation, due to the current two color software in ReplicatorG, is that we need compound polyhedra which have flat bases.  Fortunately there are a number available.\r\n\r\nHere are three examples of two color prints where a connector has been added to the top.\r\n\r\nCompound_J18_color_1.stl and Compound_J18_color_2.stl\r\nCompound_J42_color_1.stl and Compound_J42_color_2.stl\r\nCompound_J68_color_1.stl and Compound_J68_color_2.stl\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD code that produced the above files is collected in Compound_Johnson_color_scad.zip."
