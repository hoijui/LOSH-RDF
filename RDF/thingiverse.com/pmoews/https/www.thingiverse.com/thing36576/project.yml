function: "Here are three snowflakes generated using 2 of the 17 two dimensional space groups, p6 and p6m. The term \"two dimensional space group\" is a crystallographic one; in other fields they are called the plane groups or wallpaper patterns.  P6 and p6m are the only two dimensional space groups which have 6 fold rotation axes and are therefore suitable for making snow flakes.\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD code uses the equivalent positions of p6 and p6m to place hexagons within a unit cell. P6 has 6 equivalent positions and p6m has twelve.  Adjacent unit cells can be generated to form sets of 7 or 49 cells.\r\n\r\nAny shape can take the place of the hexagons and objects can be placed anywhere in the unit cell. The algorithms ensure that the space group symmetry is obeyed\r\n\r\nExample snowflakes are:\r\n\r\nsnowflake_p6m_c1.stl  - composed of 6 hexagons, 1 unit cell\r\nsnowflake_p6m_c7.stl - composed of 4 hexagons, 7 unit cells\r\nsnowflake_p6_c49.stl - composed of 3 hexagons, 49 unit cells\r\n\r\n\r\nDxf and openSCAD files are included."
