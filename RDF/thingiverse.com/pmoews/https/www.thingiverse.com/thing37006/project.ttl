    okh:function """Here is a spherical Christmas ornament decorated with the recursive snowflake described in thing:35439.  An opening in the base allows the insertion of a light.\r
\r
The snowflake is not planar but has been "bent" to fit the surface of a sphere.  The walls of the ornament are 1.5 mm thick and the snowflake is inscribed in the surface to a depth of one mm. A light of the right frequency placed inside the ornament passes through the 0.5 mm thick wall and outlines the snowflake.\r
\r
The image shown at the upper left is of a blue ABS ornament placed on a LED coaster.  The light is from a blue LED.  Similar results occur if a green LED is used.  However the blue ABS ornament (Helsinki Sky from Makerbot) does not pass light  from red or yellow LED's.\r
\r
Red, yellow, green or blue LED's can be used with a natural ABS ornament.\r
\r
A red ABS ornament is illuminated by a red LED but does not work well with blue or green LEDs.""" ;
