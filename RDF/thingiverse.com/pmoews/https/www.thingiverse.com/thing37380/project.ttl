    okh:function """These are smaller versions of thing:37006 Translucent Snowflake Ornament.  They are done in natural ABS and the decorations are simple and are well handled by my Replicator.\r
\r
The ornaments are 40 mm in diameter and are sized to fit over an inexpensive LED tea light.  A small rotating LED turntable can also be used.  The image at the upper left shows an ornament placed on a tea light.\r
\r
Two versions are given:\r
\r
Ornament_Xmas_2012.stl   which has Xmas 2012 on the top, and  3 different snowflakes on the sides.\r
\r
\r
Desk_Ornament.stl        which has a pattern based on plane group p6, a Sierpinski triangle, and a pattern based on the p4m plane group\r
\r
It is difficult to get a good picture of the ornaments, one image at the upper left is a composite of the faces of ornament_xmas_2012 lit by a blue LED.""" ;
