function: "Here are two table ornaments for a children's party and some matching cookie cutters.\r\n\r\nThis began with a request for animal cookie cutters for a party.  I started with the extensive set of cookie cutters by MaakMijnldee - (see Cookie cutter collection thing:35495).  To get cookie cutters with sharp edges I converted some of MaakMijnldee's stl files to dxf files with openSCAD and used mrbenbritton's script - (see Pi Cookie cutter - and cookie cutter script thing:28882) to convert the dxf files to finished cookie cutters.  The cookie cutters are in animal_cookiecutters.zip and the dxf files are in animals_dxf.zip\r\n\r\nThe dxf files are perfectly suited to make table ornaments like those described in Translucent Snowflake Ornament (thing:37006) and Small Desk Ornaments (thing: 37380).\r\n\r\nSmall_Animal_Ornament.stl is a spherical ornament 40 mm in diameter which sits on a LED tea light.\r\n\r\nBig_Animal_Ornament.stl is a spherical ornament 70 mm in diameter which sits over a LED tea light.\r\n\r\nBoth ornaments display images from MaakMijnldee's collection of cookie cutters - see the image at the upper left.\r\n\r\nThe image shows the ornaments illuminated by green LED's. These bright tea lights are waterproof ones powered by 2 CR2032 cells.  They are used by florist to light their arrangements.  I got mine from Amazon but they are widely available."
