function = "Here are 4 icoshedral spherical ornaments constructed using the method described in thing:39818 - Icosahedral Symmetry on a Sphere.  The ornaments are 70 mm in diameter and have an opening in the bottom so that they can be displayed on a lighted turntable. The image at the lower left shows them internally illuminated.\r\n\r\nThe icosahedral symmetry elements, (six 5 fold axes, ten 3 fold axes, and fifteen 2 fold axes), are easily identified in 3 of the ornaments.  One ornament(04), is composed of 60 triangles and 30 circles. It has the correct symmetry but the elements are slightly more difficult to locate.  It is a small version of the Times Square New Years ball.\r\n\r\nStl files are:\r\n\r\nIcosahedral_ornament_01.stl   -     Pattern used was a rosette of 10 rays  each ray bearing 2 circles\r\n\r\nIcosahedral_ornament_02.stl -    Pattern used was a rosette of 20 rays\r\n\r\nIcosahedral_ornament_03.stl -   Pattern used was the three fold array of Sierpinski triangles  from thing:39424\r\n\r\nIcosahedral_ornament_04.stl -    Pattern used was a mapping of an icosahedron and a dodecahedron on to a sphere with the addition of  circles at the two fold axes.\r\n\r\nThe patterns used are dxf files; they are included in dxf_files.zip.  The openSCAD code is gen_icosahedral_ornament.scad."
