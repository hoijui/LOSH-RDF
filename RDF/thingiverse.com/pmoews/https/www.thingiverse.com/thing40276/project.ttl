    okh:function """Here is openSCAD code which covers a sphere with a pattern displaying tetrahedral symmetry.  The code uses the same technique as that described in things 39424 and 39818 and completes the method based on the Platonic solids.\r
\r
\r
A tetrahedron has 4 three fold rotation axis which pass through the vertices.  The vertices are mapped to a sphere and the 3 fold patterns centered at the mapped vertices.  The pattern used was sierpinski_triangles_3.dxf; the dxf file and a picture are available at thing:39424.\r
\r
Stl files are:\r
\r
sierpinski_tetrahedral_small.stl  a sphere 50 mm in diameter\r
\r
sierpinski_tetrahedral_large.stl  a truncated sphere 70 mm in diameter.\r
\r
\r
One interesting thing is that a three fold pattern generated from the Sierpinski triangles by tetrahedral symmetry resembles a four fold pattern generated by octahedral symmetry (thing:39424) and a five fold pattern generated by icosahedral symmetry (thing:39977).  See the image at the lower left.\r
\r
The openSCAD code that generated the spheres is gen_tetrahedral_symmetry.scad.""" ;
