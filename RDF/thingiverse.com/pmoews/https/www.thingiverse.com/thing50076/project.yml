function: "Here are four decorated water bowls sized for cats.  They are easily scaleable to suit smaller and larger animals.\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD code is parametric - parameters are:\r\n\r\n the bowl diameter in mm,\r\n the bottom thickness.\r\n the height of the rim,\r\n and the rim thickness.\r\n\r\nOne can choose one of four decoration for the bottom; the decorations expand and contract to fit the size of the bowl.\r\n\r\nThe images comes from MaakMijnldee's cookie cutter collection - thing:35495.  Dxf_files.zip holds the images and needs to be expanded and available when running the openSCAD code.  Images of the decorations are shown at the upper left."
