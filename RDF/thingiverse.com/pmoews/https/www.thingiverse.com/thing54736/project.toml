function = "MaakMijnldee's cat figure, see thing:35495, is asymmetric. A mirror reflection turns a right facing cat into a left facing cat that is not superimposable.  I find it an attractive motif and suitable for representing the 17 plane groups.\r\n\r\nHere are 4 coasters for dual extrusion which illustrate plane groups p1, p2, pm and pg.  Constructed directly on the build surface they have pleasing smooth surfaces.\r\n\r\nFour pairs of stl files are provided:\r\n\r\ncat_coaster_p1.stl and cat_decoration_p1.stl\r\ncat_coaster_p2.stl and cat_deocration_p2.stl\r\ncat_coaster_pm.stl and cat_decoration_pm.stl\r\ncat_coaster_pg.stl and cat_decoration_pg.stl\r\n\r\nCat_coasters_01 scad created the stl files and the images are in coasters_dxf_01.zip.  Hopefully more will follow."
