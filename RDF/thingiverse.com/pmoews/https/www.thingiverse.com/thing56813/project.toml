function = "Here are four more cat coasters based on the 17 plane groups.  See Cat Coasters 01 - thing:54736.\r\n\r\nThe four plane groups are: cm. pmm, pmg, and pgg.  The number of symmetry elements increases as we procede through the plane groups.  These groups contain combinations of reflection lines and glide reflection lines. The four sets of files for dual extrusion are:\r\n\r\ncat_coaster_cm.stl and cat_decoration_cm.stl\r\ncat_coaster_pmm.stl and cat_deocration_pmm.stl\r\ncat_coaster_pmg.stl and cat_decoration_pmg.stl\r\ncat_coaster_pgg.stl and cat_decoration_pgg.stl\r\n\r\nCat_coasters_02 scad created the stl files and the images are in coasters_dxf_02.zip"
