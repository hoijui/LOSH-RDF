    okh:function """Some, (see comments at thing:30421), have asked for d10 dice.  There are many d10 dice available on thingiverse, (see things 3018, 29055, 33392, 38156, and 58408).  Several have the traditional form but other methods of construction are described.  The earliest version, thing:3018 by TheRooster, is quite attractive.\r
\r
Here are four based on the standard pentagonal trapezohedron.  OpenSCAD code is provided so that modifications can be made.  All the dice have flat faces and should be easily printed.  Provided are small and large dice, both plain and with flattened edges.  Stl files are:\r
\r
d10_small.stl and d10_small_minkowski.stl\r
d10_large.stl and d10.large_minkowski.stl\r
\r
The pentagonal trapezohedron was constructed from a pentagonal antiprism by the method described in thing:30958.  Numbers are taken from the font Architects Daughter by polymaker, thing:13677.  The openSCAD program that created the dice is tp10_dice.scad and dxf images of the numbers are in numbers_dxf.zip.\r
\r
The flattened edge versions come from a minkowski sum of the pentagonal trapezohedron and its dual, the pentagonal antiprism.  Examples of polyhedra produced by minkowski sums are included in the openSCAD program.""" ;
