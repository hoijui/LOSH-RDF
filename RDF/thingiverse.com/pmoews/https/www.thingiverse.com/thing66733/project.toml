function = "Here is a collection of 3-D dragon curves.\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD code that generates the curves is  partially parametric.  The lines that generate the dragon curves are replaced by rectangular blocks and one can specify the length, width, and height of the blocks.  An additional parameter is the degree of the curve; allowed values are 1 through 10.\r\n\r\nStl files are provided for  dragon curves of degree 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\r\n\r\nThe openSCAD code that generated the files is dragon_curves_3d.scad."
