I have as security light whose switch is right above the switch for our hall light. Well-meaning visitors, the chronologically and vertically challenged and the memory-deficient often hit the wrong switch rending the security light inactive. Enter Sketchup, Slic3r, Pronterface and Printrbot to the rescue.\r
