function: "All of the other light switch covers I found here were for the large protruding US style of light switches. We aren't so self-conscious in Australia that we need to offset our phallic deficiencies with large light switches... anyway, I digress...\r\n\r\nI have as security light whose switch is right above the switch for our hall light. Well-meaning visitors, the chronologically and vertically challenged and the memory-deficient often hit the wrong switch rending the security light inactive. Enter Sketchup, Slic3r, Pronterface and Printrbot to the rescue.\r\n\r\nThis was my first print with my new 0.35mm tip, and it's amazing the difference over the 0.5mm tip - especially the top layers."
