function = "Some users have found that the rafts generated by common toolpath generators are wasteful of material and difficult to remove. cptnAWESOME found that it is easier to add raft-like features to .stl files prior to passing them to a toolpath generator, as in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16596.\r\n\r\nThis script performs this function automatically and uniformly, so that designers can distribute files in a form that is as machine- and technology-independent as possible. The user can then apply whatever preprocesseing steps are necessary to ensure the best print characteristics on her machine."
