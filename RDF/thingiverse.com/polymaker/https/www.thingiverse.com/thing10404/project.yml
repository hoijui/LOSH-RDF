function: "This script takes text and makes it 3d. I know this has been done before but I thought this was a unique approach, so here it is. The script uses the Cairo and Pango libraries to render with whatever fonts you have installed (should be cross-platform though I have only tested on Linux). The thing that differentiates this approach most from others is that the text is anti-aliased.\r\n\r\nThe latest code will always be here:\r\nhttps://github.com/brad/text2surface\r\n\r\nNOTE: This suffers from the same size limitation as it's predecessor, so if you make the text too large OpenSCAD will crash when rendering it. I've found 70 to be a good font size for a sign that spans the build platform, so that's the default.\r\n\r\nUpdates\r\n=======\r\n2011-09-30: Added ability to extrude non anti-aliased text."
