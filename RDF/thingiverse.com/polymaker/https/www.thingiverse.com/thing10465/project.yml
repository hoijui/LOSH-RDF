function: "Make your mark!\r\n\r\nI included all the files created in the process. I started out using Gimp for the initial design, then saved that to svg and did the rest of the work in inkscape. In retrospect, I think I made this a lot harder than it needed to be, especially considering that the open source hardware logo comes in SCAD format.\r\n\r\nI got the RepRap teardrop from here: http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapLogo\r\nand the open hardware logo from here: http://oshwlogo.com/\r\nI'm not sure what the license is on these, so I just used a generic creative commons license."
