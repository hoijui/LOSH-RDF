    okh:function """I timed the release of this guide to coincide with and commemorate the latest release of OpenSCAD[1]! The latest version (2011.12) was released today, so go out and get it now! I've marked this thing as a work in progress because it will need updating, though I won't update this thing, except minor/grammatical changes (any updates should be made in the form of a derivative, so anyone can do it!)\r
\r
With OpenSCAD projects increasing in complexity every day, I think it's extremely important for those of us who use it to start thinking about a consistent style. The layout of the code is just as important as the technical accuracy and efficiency, because a good layout allows for readable, reusable, and maintainable code.\r
\r
I would like to propose the following guidelines for style in OpenSCAD code. If you disagree, please speak up or create a derivative. I don't expect this to be the final word on the subject. My goal is to open up a dialog that will hopefully result in more maintainable OpenSCAD code.""" ;
