function = "I finally decided to try Greg's extruder (from the felt branch of PrusaMendel). The gears meshed and turned but there was a tiny bit of space in between them giving the extruder a bit of unwanted wiggle room. I had some leftover felt so I threw that on there and it works great! It also has the side-effect of completely eliminating any clicking noises.\r\n\r\nEDIT: After only minor use, the felt slipped off. This needs a little more thought. Perhaps a couple more tabs would provide the necessary stability.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I don't recommend anyone use this. It worked for a while, but the felt got stretched/compressed and it stopped working. Perhaps another material may work better?"
