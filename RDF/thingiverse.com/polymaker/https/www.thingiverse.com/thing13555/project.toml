function = "When I saw the original I wondered if I could put one on each side so I could have two colors ready to go at any time. I did, then I figured I might as well add some filament guides on there. I went ahead and used a teardrop shape for the guides to pay tribute to RepRap. Please don't fault me for the low quality of the prints.  I was working through some quality issues, but the parts are still functional :)\r\nI've used this for a while and it works great. You do have to use two spools to make this work, but then you'll be all set for that dual extruder upgrade.\r\nFYI, I don't have a dual extruder, I just staged the photo to make it look like both spools were feeding the extruder at the same time."
