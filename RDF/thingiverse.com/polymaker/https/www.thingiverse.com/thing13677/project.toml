function = "I've been holding on to this one for awhile so I could release it today, to commemorate the latest release of OpenSCAD! This latest release (2011.12) is required to use these fonts, so go download it now! (http://www.openscad.org).\r\nThis is an upgrade to pipakin's OpenSCAD Font Importer, along with a bundle of generated OpenSCAD files for the fonts from the Google Web Font directory (http://www.google.com/webfonts). As noted on the original, there is a significant bug (not known whether the bug is in the font importer or in OpenSCAD itself) causing varying levels of font support. I rendered a sentence in each one to determine the level of support as best I can. My research was not exhaustive and some entries in the table below will be wrong. That said, I tried to be as accurate as I could and if you notice anything wrong/missing please let me know and I will correct it.\r\nIf I said it is supported, that means I was unable to find any problems with rendering the font. â€œPartialâ€x9d means it seems to work with the exception of some letters (noted in the â€œNotesâ€x9d column). â€œNoâ€x9d means I was unable to render a simple sentence with the font, usually due to a 2-manifold error.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of improvements over the original:\r\n- Use a normal string as input (up to 100 characters)\r\n- Use the \"extra\" parameter to add extra space between characters\r\n- Use the \"height\" parameter to specify the extruded height\r\n- Specify height=0 to keep the text 2D for .dxf export\r\n- BezConic module inside each file so you only need to include the font file\r\n\r\nGet the latest code from here: https://github.com/brad/OpenSCAD-Font-Importer\r\n\r\nALSO NOTE: These font files are not meant to be edited, or even viewed. If you have a weak heart, or are pregnant, do not look inside because there be dragons. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
