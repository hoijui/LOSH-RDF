    okh:function """I've been holding on to this one for awhile so I could release it today, to commemorate the latest release of OpenSCAD! This latest release (2011.12) is required to use these fonts, so go download it now! (http://www.openscad.org).\r
This is an upgrade to pipakin's OpenSCAD Font Importer, along with a bundle of generated OpenSCAD files for the fonts from the Google Web Font directory (http://www.google.com/webfonts). As noted on the original, there is a significant bug (not known whether the bug is in the font importer or in OpenSCAD itself) causing varying levels of font support. I rendered a sentence in each one to determine the level of support as best I can. My research was not exhaustive and some entries in the table below will be wrong. That said, I tried to be as accurate as I could and if you notice anything wrong/missing please let me know and I will correct it.\r
If I said it is supported, that means I was unable to find any problems with rendering the font. â€œPartialâ€ means it seems to work with the exception of some letters (noted in the â€œNotesâ€ column). â€œNoâ€ means I was unable to render a simple sentence with the font, usually due to a 2-manifold error.\r
\r
There are a number of improvements over the original:\r
- Use a normal string as input (up to 100 characters)\r
- Use the "extra" parameter to add extra space between characters\r
- Use the "height" parameter to specify the extruded height\r
- Specify height=0 to keep the text 2D for .dxf export\r
- BezConic module inside each file so you only need to include the font file\r
\r

\r
ALSO NOTE: These font files are not meant to be edited, or even viewed. If you have a weak heart, or are pregnant, do not look inside because there be dragons. Don't say I didn't warn you!""" ;
