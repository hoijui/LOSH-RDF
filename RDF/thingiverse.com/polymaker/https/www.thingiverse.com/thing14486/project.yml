function: "I needed a smily face for an OpenSCAD design I'm working on. I thought I might as well created a few different smilies while I was at it.\r\nThis first version of the library comes with five smily styles: :), :D, :(, ;), and :|\r\nI've included STL's for 3D printers and DXF's for laser cutters.\r\nThe zip contains all the other files listed."
