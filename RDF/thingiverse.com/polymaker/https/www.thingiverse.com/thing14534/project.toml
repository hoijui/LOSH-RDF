function = "UPDATE: A commenter pointed out that mosts plastics are NOT food grade! So I recommend not using this for drinks until that issue is worked out.\r\n\r\nSo a RepRap, an Ultimaker, and a Makerbot walk into a bar...\r\nI'm actually not sure how to finish that.\r\n\r\nHere's a set of printable swizzle sticks! Use them to stab olives, fish out ice cubes, and identify your drink. Print a bunch and use them at your next party. They include hooks to hold onto the edge of the glass so they won't sink in.\r\n\r\nI've include 9 different styles, some 3D printer themed, some christmas themed, and some just for fun (from left to right):\r\nreprap         - RepRap teardrop\r\nultimaker      - the Ultimaker robot\r\nmakerbot       - the Makerbot M\r\nsmily1         - the :) smily face\r\nsmily2         - the :D smily face\r\nstar           - a 5-pointed star\r\nchristmas_tree - a christmas tree\r\nsnowman        - a snowman\r\nunicorn        - a unicorn head, why not?\r\n\r\nThe zip includes single and plate versions of all designs as *.stl files as well as *.dxf files. I'm not familiar with laser cutting, but I think this should work well with the appropriate (thin) material. For convenience I have also attached the *_single.stl files individually.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't call this a derivative of any one thing, but it uses the following things:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14472\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14600\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14486\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14629\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14601\r\n\r\nI've included the necessary files from those things for convenience.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: I am not responsible if you do something foolish after drinking too much. Please just don't."
