\r
So a RepRap, an Ultimaker, and a Makerbot walk into a bar...\r
I'm actually not sure how to finish that.\r
\r
Here's a set of printable swizzle sticks! Use them to stab olives, fish out ice cubes, and identify your drink. Print a bunch and use them at your next party. They include hooks to hold onto the edge of the glass so they won't sink in.\r
\r
I've include 9 different styles, some 3D printer themed, some christmas themed, and some just for fun (from left to right):\r
reprap         - RepRap teardrop\r
ultimaker      - the Ultimaker robot\r
makerbot       - the Makerbot M\r
smily1         - the :) smily face\r
smily2         - the :D smily face\r
star           - a 5-pointed star\r
christmas_tree - a christmas tree\r
snowman        - a snowman\r
unicorn        - a unicorn head, why not?\r
\r
The zip includes single and plate versions of all designs as *.stl files as well as *.dxf files. I'm not familiar with laser cutting, but I think this should work well with the appropriate (thin) material. For convenience I have also attached the *_single.stl files individually.\r
\r
I wouldn't call this a derivative of any one thing, but it uses the following things:\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14472\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14600\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14486\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14629\r
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14601\r
\r
I've included the necessary files from those things for convenience.\r
