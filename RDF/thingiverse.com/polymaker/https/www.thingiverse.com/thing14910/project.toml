function = "Now robots can be gangstas too. This is a gangsta model with the Ultimaker robot head. I know I'm a little late to the party here, but I really wanted to do a mashup anyway.\r\nOf course the original gangsta is here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5367\r\nMy apologies for the crudeness of the model, but I don't know how to use 3d modelling programs to smooth. This was done 100% in OpenSCAD making use of the 3d hull() function which will be part of the upcoming release.\r\nI had to run the gangsta model through Netfabb to get OpenSCAD to take it, so I uploaded the fixed version.\r\nThis is also a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14472\r\n\r\nEDIT: I loaded it into meshlab, which made it pretty easy to smooth the line at the base of the neck attachment area. I uploaded a new version with the smoothing, which is a lot smaller for some reason."
