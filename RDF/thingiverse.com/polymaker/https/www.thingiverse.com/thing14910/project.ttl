    okh:function """Now robots can be gangstas too. This is a gangsta model with the Ultimaker robot head. I know I'm a little late to the party here, but I really wanted to do a mashup anyway.\r
Of course the original gangsta is here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5367\r
My apologies for the crudeness of the model, but I don't know how to use 3d modelling programs to smooth. This was done 100% in OpenSCAD making use of the 3d hull() function which will be part of the upcoming release.\r
I had to run the gangsta model through Netfabb to get OpenSCAD to take it, so I uploaded the fixed version.\r
This is also a derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14472\r
\r
EDIT: I loaded it into meshlab, which made it pretty easy to smooth the line at the base of the neck attachment area. I uploaded a new version with the smoothing, which is a lot smaller for some reason.""" ;
