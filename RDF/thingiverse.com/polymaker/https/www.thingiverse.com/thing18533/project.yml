function: Ever went for a smoke, only to realize there was nowhere for your butt? That predicament will be a thing of the past with iAsh! Simply insert your iPhone in iAsh, which doubles as a conveniently proportioned case with cutouts for access to buttons, and now you will always have an ash tray on hand! Pull up a picture of butts on the phone for added effect.
