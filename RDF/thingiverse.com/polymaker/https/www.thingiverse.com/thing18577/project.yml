function: "Have you even been beat up by a group of mean thugs? Ever wonder what a geek like you could possibly do about it? Well wonder no more. Just carry these iKnuckles and you'll be ready for any situation. Can also be used to convey a message very powerfully.\r\nI sized it for my fingers but it's easy to adjust. I uploaded a version for right handers as well as leftys."
