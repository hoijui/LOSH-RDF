function: "This is a crude model of a MyTouch4g, for use in making accessories. It does not include any fine details and I couldn't get all the rounding in there. Hopefully it's close enough, I measured everything with digital calipers.\r\n\r\nIt's in the same position as http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12879 so it can almost be a drop-in replacement (they are very nearly the same size) for any iphone accessory.\r\n\r\nI designed the script to be reusable for other phones with a similar form factor, of which there are many."
