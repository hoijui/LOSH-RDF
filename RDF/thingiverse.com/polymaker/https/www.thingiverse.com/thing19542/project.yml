function: "iBrush is a revolutionary new iPhone accessory that turns your iPhone into an electric toothbrush.\r\n\r\nDon't want to pay the ridiculous prices for an electric toothbrush or the replacement heads? This accessory is the answer!\r\n\r\nMyVibe can be used to turn the vibrator on. An iBrush app with multiple brush schedules is in development.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This thing uses the OpenSCAD Eco-Dent library, which will be finished soon."
