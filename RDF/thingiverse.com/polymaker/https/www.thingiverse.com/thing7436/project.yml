function: "This thing is a resting place for a brush dish scrubber. You rest the dish scrubber here on the edge of the sink, brush side down, in between doing dishes and the water will drain off the brush and down into the sink.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nThe first version was way too tall for any current RepRap/RepStrap or anything like it. I have printed v2 myself and am using it now as you can see in the photo."
