function: This thing can be used to pick up food crumbs, pet hair, lint, and (my personal favorite) little plastic shavings. This is my first attempt at drawing a curve on my Wacom tablet and using it in my design. Also my first time using QCad, which is pretty nice. This thing will remain a work in progress until it is printed and known working.
