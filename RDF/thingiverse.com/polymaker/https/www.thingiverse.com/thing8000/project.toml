function = "This script converts english to Braille using a Grade 1 transcription. It can print the braille at any size you want, of course. Use it to add accessibility to signs, put it on a business card, or use in guerrilla accessibility efforts on street corners.  \n\nThere are several limitations:  \n- A limited set of common symbols are supported. If an unsupported symbol is encountered, a space is printed.  \n- Uppercase is converted to lowercase, this is due to a limitation in OpenSCAD.  \n- For long blocks of text, you need to manually specify the line breaks, also due to a limitation in OpenSCAD (immutable variables and lack of recursive function support)"
