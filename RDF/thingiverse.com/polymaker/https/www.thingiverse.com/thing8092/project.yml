function: "The little knob is always coming out on my flip flops so I designed a thing to provide some support.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: For a second there I forgot that you can't deposit plastic into thin air, so v2 is an alternate version that won't be as comfortable, but it should print and work just fine.\r\n\r\nFINAL UPDATE: I have actually printed and am using v3. It works, so this is no longer a work in progress"
