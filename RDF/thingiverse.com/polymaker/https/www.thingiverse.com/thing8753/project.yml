function: "I don't like having a bunch of different versioned files cluttering up my thing, so I made a derivative with a new feature. This version can make triangular based pyramids. I haven't fully wrapped my head around Openscad polyhedrons, so I stole some code from Revar's comment here[1]. Like the original sierpinski pyramid, this can only be compiled in openscadpy; an unfortunately strict requirement but it IS parametric and it IS fractal.\r\n\r\n[1] http://blog.thingiverse.com/2009/11/06/in-which-openscad-wins-me-over/"
