function = "A three pieces support for a 40 mm  fan, designed for my prusa mendel from makergear, because I was thinking the fan I mount before was to far from the printing piece and the hot end I made a cone for it to blow closer, it use 8 M3 bolt, I use 6 M3x25 and 2 M3x10.\r\n\r\nThe different pieces are, the support that go on the x carriage, and the support for the fan that you can rotate. See picture for better understanding."
