function: "Want a play william tell with your apple phone ? just put it in the headset, wear the headset to anybody, and shoot.\r\n\r\nupdate: you can also use it to play guess who games with friends, or like a beacon while your on your bicycle (see pictures) or as a head lamp to read while you're in bed.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: Version 2b added, I made a place to allow it to be secured with a rubberband."
