function = "DonÂ´t know if this is the first fabber part ever, but it was mine.\r\nIn 2003 the crank of my cheese grater broke. I liked the design and was not willing to waste it. But I had no idea where to get the spare part. So I decided in my christmas holidays 2003 to build it by myself. I designed an optimized version with turnable crank grip and built it in Alumide on a laser-sintering machine. It broke never again and is still in use. I looked on the save date of the original file: it is 01.01.2004.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you know a documented case earlier."
