function = "We like to store dry goods (lentils, rice, flour, couscous, porridge...) in empty 4pt milk jugs - they're easy to pour from, line up neatly, and are translucent so you can see at a glance what you're running short of. The tricky bit is filling the jugs up. This Thing allows you to make a screw-on funnel out of another milk jug, so you can securely and easily fill your storage jugs up.\r\n\r\nThis Thing was made in OpenSCAD, based on code by Andrew Plumb (@clothbot). You can fork the code on GitHub: https://github.com/pozorvlak/funnel-collar\r\n\r\nMeasurements are based on UK milk jug lids. It fits all brands of milk jug I've tried so far, though it's a bit snug on Tesco ones. The SCAD file is parametric, so it should be easy to adjust this to other countries' milk jugs if need be."
