function: "You know when you want to work on one of your many crochet projects but the hook you need has disappeared down the back of the sofa, or possibly rolled under the bookshelf, or by some other means gone to join the secret underground society of its fellows that all your craft supplies eventually escape to join? And you know how that always happens when the shops are shut and you can't buy a new one? Well fear not! This model allows you to print out a crochet hook of whatever dimension you want! Assuming that your 3D printer hasn't similarly got lost under a sofa cushion, of course.\r\n\r\nThe SCAD code for this Thing is on GitHub at https://github.com/pozorvlak/crochet-hook."
