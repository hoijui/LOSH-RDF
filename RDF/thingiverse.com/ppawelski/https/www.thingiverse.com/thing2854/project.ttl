    okh:function """This is a first pass at the plastic parts for Squito-style muscle wire actuated robot.  It is BIG for a muscle wire bot and I haven't worked out all of the forces yet.  Latter versions will probably have lightening holes and may be scaled down.\r
\r
The pivot group is designed for the Makerbot Cupcake CNC and is entered in the current Make contest.  The horizontal pin holes will still need to be drilled.\r
\r
The rest of the bot can be cut using a small CNC router.\r
\r
The model is in SketchUp.  I plan to export STL files to FreeMill to create the G-code.\r
\r
This is a first pass done mostly to improve SketchUp skils.  Feel free to comment or improve.""" ;
