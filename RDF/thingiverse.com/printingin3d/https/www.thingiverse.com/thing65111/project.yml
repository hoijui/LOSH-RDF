function: "Just a simple shelf to be used between two vertical surfaces - for example two wardrobes in the kitchen - to store light things on it. It was designed as a spice shelf.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about it here: http://www.printingin3d.eu/item/shelf\r\n\r\nWe printed one set of it, but didn't use it in the end. We designed a completely different one as you can read on the link."
