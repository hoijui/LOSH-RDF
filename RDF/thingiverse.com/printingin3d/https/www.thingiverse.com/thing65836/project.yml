function: "This is another shelf holder, but this time we focused to make sure it can be applied on to one wall. This model is parametric too, just like our first model, but it's been generated with a Java based framework, which we are working on, so it cannot be parameterized from the OpenSCAD version. We are working on the framework to be able to publish it soon.  \n\nYou can read about it more at http://www.printingin3d.eu/item/shelf  \n\nUpdate: [JavaSCAD](http://www.printingin3d.eu/javascad) has been published, so we attached the Java source file too."
