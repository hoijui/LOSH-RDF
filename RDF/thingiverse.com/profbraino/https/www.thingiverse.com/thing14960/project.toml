function = "Derivative work of laser cut MDF guide for 3mm filament from Sacha Di'Angeli at PS1 (which I could not print) and of thing 13351, which needed a slot for easy access.   \r\nFirst attempt at openSCAD 2011.12.19\r\nCould not figure out existing part 13351, so mostly started from scratch\r\n\r\nThis part is an attachment to accessible Wader's extruder, it is a guide for 3mm filament to prevent filament walking off guide bearing.\r\nThe primary difference from thing 13351 is the slot from the PS1 part, which allows flip up for easy access change filament and to clean the hobbed bolt.\r\nThe file was intended to controlled completely by the filament diameter parameter; but I quit while ahead after getting 3mm filament to work on my machine.  I did some weird rotation so the loop would not start in an inconvenient location, this may be no longer necessary."
