function = "Dishwasher around here are offered under various brands, but they are all pretty much the same unit. \r\n\r\nThe wire basket that holds the dishes has wheels that clip on to the basket.  These wear out sooner than most of the rest of the unit.  \r\n\r\nThese clips replace the original wheel bearing clips with a tighter tolerance.\r\n\r\nPLA prints have held up well after several weeks, with no sign of failure."
