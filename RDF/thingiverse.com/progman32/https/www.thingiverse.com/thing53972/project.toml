function = "My 2004 RX-8's climate control fan knob broke right on its stem. Cost of a new one is like fifty bucks! Gluing it back together is difficult because of the small surfaces and the fact that it's HDPE. So I made this little adapter that uses a friction fit on the remaining bits to re-create the necessary mounting hardware. It may fit other years, not sure."
