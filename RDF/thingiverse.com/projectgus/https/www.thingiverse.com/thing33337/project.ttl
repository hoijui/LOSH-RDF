    okh:function """A redesign of the printed parts of the RepRap Pro Huxley extruder, to use push-to-fit type connectors on each end of the Bowden tube.\r
\r
Made because we had lots of problems with the tube popping out under load from the extruder. The push-to-fit connectors are much sturdier.\r
\r
Can be retrofitted to a stock Rep Rap Pro Huxley.\r
\r
This is a derived work of the original Rep Rap Pro Huxley, which can be found at https://github.com/reprappro/Huxley\r
\r
There is also a git repository with these changes made to the original Rep Rap Pro Huxley design, at\r
https://github.com/projectgus/huxley/tree/feature-extruder-pushfit\r
\r
You may also want to look into this as a simpler alternative (I didn't know these were available when I started this project):\r
