function: "A redesign of the printed parts of the RepRap Pro Huxley extruder, to use push-to-fit type connectors on each end of the Bowden tube.\r\n\r\nMade because we had lots of problems with the tube popping out under load from the extruder. The push-to-fit connectors are much sturdier.\r\n\r\nCan be retrofitted to a stock Rep Rap Pro Huxley.\r\n\r\nThis is a derived work of the original Rep Rap Pro Huxley, which can be found at https://github.com/reprappro/Huxley\r\n\r\nThere is also a git repository with these changes made to the original Rep Rap Pro Huxley design, at\r\nhttps://github.com/projectgus/huxley/tree/feature-extruder-pushfit\r\n\r\nYou may also want to look into this as a simpler alternative (I didn't know these were available when I started this project):\r\nhttp://www.emakershop.com/browse/listing?l=237"
