function = "OPENBEAM is an amazing new aluminum extrusion design that gets rid of the expensive T-nuts used on other extrusions types.\r\n\r\nIt replaces the expensive T-Nuts with M3 sized nuts and bolts that are available form most hardware stores at an fraction of the T-Nut's cost. \r\n\r\nBecause its a micro type extrusion it can sometimes be very tedious to insert the small M3 nuts.\r\n\r\nSo we created Quick Nut Loader for the extrusions that can quickly be printed on a 3 printer.\r\n\r\nProtoneer Blog - http://blog.protoneer.co.nz\r\nProtoneer Shop - http://shop.protoneer.co.nz"
