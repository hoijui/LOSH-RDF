function = "This is a derivative of the charles pax filament spool holder.  it is a little more flexible because of the 3 slots, and the holder is taller to accommodate thicker spools (as found inside stratysis dimension 3d printer cartridges). Also, it is shelled out to reduce print time, and volume of material.  There is a slot to clear the head of a screw when mounted on a thingomatic's side."
