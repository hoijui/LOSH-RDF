function = "The Brutstruder supplied in the makergear stepper kit was not adequate for my needs, and the mounting system that was supplied wasn't working with my setup.  I therefore chose to modify MattewLaBerge's modification of the brutstruder design, and it seems to be holding up.  It is no longer \"quick change\" though (regarding the hot end) because the groovemount is on the back in this version."
