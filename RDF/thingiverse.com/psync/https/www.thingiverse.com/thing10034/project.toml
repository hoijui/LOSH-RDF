function = "This is an upgrade/mod for Ultimaker or really any belt-driven device.\r\n\r\nI had some slack belts on my Ultimaker, and I was inspired by this parametric  buckle http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9633 to come up with a printable solution. \r\n\r\nMy first version was closed and similar to the belt buckle, but then I realized the difficulty in mounting it to the belt since it would have involved attaching the screw under tension. A quick Dremelling added a gap that I used to then slide the affixed device over the belt (see photos)."
