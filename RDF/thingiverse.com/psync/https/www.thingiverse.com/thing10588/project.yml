function: "Happy Singapore National Day!\r\n\r\nJust in time for August 9th, which is Singapore's independence day, I found a model of our national mascot, the Merlion (half-lion half-fish) in Google's Sketchup warehouse ( http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=cbe04aa7255b3611f684f365c601800e&prevstart=0 ) and decided it would be a fun thing to have one connected to a water pistol that spewed water like the real thing!\r\n\r\nSingapore literally means \"Lion City\" and being a port city, the half-lion half-fish mascot was born."
