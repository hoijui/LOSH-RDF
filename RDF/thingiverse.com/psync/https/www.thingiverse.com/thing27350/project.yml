function: "Here's my derivative of Mattraptions' desk lamp, with added M3 screw holes. Some parts will still need to be edited and beefed up, but I thought I'd share it anyway. An alternative to anyone who likes screws instead :D\r\n\r\nI've also rotated all the parts to lay flat for printing, and should be sliced okay."
