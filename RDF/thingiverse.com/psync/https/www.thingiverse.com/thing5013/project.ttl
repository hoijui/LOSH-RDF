I was trying to use the twist function in OpenSCAD, but a friend of mine mentioned using two rotated split toruses and this is the result.\r
\r
I've managed to print this out successfully, and this is part of a clamp I'm designing, but I figured this might be useful to someone out there. I have yet to try out just printing the spring portion, but it might work!""" ;
