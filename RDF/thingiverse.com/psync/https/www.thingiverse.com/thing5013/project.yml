function: "My first ever Thingiverse upload! This is a screw thread described in OpenSCAD, and as a bonus you can use the helix module portion to generate a spring as well! I was trying to use the twist function in OpenSCAD, but a friend of mine mentioned using two rotated split toruses and this is the result.\r\n\r\nI've managed to print this out successfully, and this is part of a clamp I'm designing, but I figured this might be useful to someone out there. I have yet to try out just printing the spring portion, but it might work!"
