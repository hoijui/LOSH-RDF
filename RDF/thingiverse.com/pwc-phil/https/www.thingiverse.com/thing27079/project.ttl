    okh:function """It would seem that MakerBOT Industries has all angles of the emerging end-user-based 3D model and rapid prototyping maker market well in hand.  All, that is, save a rapid response, in-person mobile sales and service presence always nearby, Brooklyn born boots on the ground for potential commerce, hacker space presence, repair/troubleshooting support and pre-scheduled industrial or educational product demonstrations.\r
\r
Enter, the Botwagon!  A re-purposed FedEX-type delivery van, detailed to house regionally placed Johnny Appleseed-like marauding evangelists on their daily travails to put plastic into peoples hands and joy into their hearts.  A well-integrated living, working and botting space, purpose-made for those inspired to carouse these botless streets and lonesome byways, searching for the unmet masses in need of a maker solution and a plastic-formed smile.  \r
\r
With itâ€™s roof placed photovoltaic array, self-sustaining systems, storage tanks and other utility resources tucked beneath and accessed from the rear door, this whirlwind of enterprise can support two outside salesmen, twenty-first century tech adventurers driven to a life lived on a constant circuit of touring travel.  Integrated shower/toilet, an all electric stove and fridge, generous sink, ample material storage and grommet anchored counter space, the bots can whir their magic, even when in transit from potential sale to community festival.  The bed has a hinged and anchored conversion feature, for easy switch from sleep, to couch, to fully laminated work surface with a simple flip and twist.\r
\r
Whether by corporate scheduled demonstration, retail presence, marketing meeting or random foodtruck-ish placement all over town, our wheeled friend will help supply that last nudge to those of us who were nearly sold by the web demos, countless YouTube videos and media graphics, but just needed that final assurance of having hands on plastic and/or the priceless experience of watching a bot purr with our very own eyes.\r
\r
Clear the roads ye competitors, and heads up potential buyers, the Botwagon is rambling to a middle school classroom or city corner near you!  \r
\r
When printing, our bot is live to the web at www.justin.tv/bot14me2\r

Peace!""" ;
