function: "My wife has a great collection of things for crafting, but very few crochet hooks.  She asked me to pick up a J sized hook from the store.  I countered by offering to print one for her.  This is the result.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of improvements that could be made, particularly around making it parametric, but it does appear to be functional, as my wife is crocheting with it as I type this."
