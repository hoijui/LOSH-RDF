    okh:function """This hot end is the result of my attempt to build the Wildseyed Simple Hot End by jcabrer for my Simpler repstrap.  I live in Metric land, along with the ROW (rest of the world) which started my journey down the path less taken to begin with...\r
\r
I noticed that it would be possible to use the previously unused M6 thread on the MIG tip to our advantage, and make the tip itself easily exchangeable.  This design also makes the fitting of the PTFE easier and more precisely aligned than I could manage on Wildseyed, with the unexpected bonus of a double seal on the PTFE rod.\r
\r
Using the gas connector nipple also gives a flat face for the heater, making working with nichrome a bit easier, giving you a choice of heater technology.\r
\r
Note that this hot end is very definitely a work in progress, and that the instructions will be updated as I go along.""" ;
