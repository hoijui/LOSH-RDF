function: "So, the other thing was a dart.  Very purposeful and straight downwards movement on that thing.\r\n\r\nThis one flies well, but I'll see if I can work out the CAD files for it.\r\n\r\nIt was quite literally derived from the Free falling design.  I changed it by hand until it worked.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if something like this is even printable with no support, and even so - the support may be stronger than the fragile wing.  I will give the tip a flat foot to stand on.  Printing vertically may be the only way forward."
