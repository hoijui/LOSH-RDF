function: "Not everyone has unlimited access to the US nickel, and as an exercise to myself I made this fully parametric coin calibrator in OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nModeled to be virtually identical to its ancestor, you can now measure your favorite nickel alternative coin in your country of choice, and print your local flavor calibrator, ready for the coins in your pocket right now.\r\n\r\nTo limit confusion I added labels to the axis courtesy of tbuser's bitmap fonts. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2054\r\n(place the bitmap.scad file in the same folder to make it work)"
