    okh:function """This is the third iteration of the Vertical Wind turbine.\r
\r
It has been replaced by the next version, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16504\r
\r
Mk5 has been printed by Imitation, and sadly did not perform as expected.\r
\r
\r
New variation on source will allow solid blades, and the option to select the hole diameter in the blade...\r
\r
Added optional tabs to ensure sharp end sticks to the build plate. Thickness adjustable in code.\r
\r
Changes include:\r
* After an interesting email from my father/mentor, the wing profile changed to apply forces inwards to counteract the centrifugal forces of the turbine. This arrangement should also increase the turbine torque, while bringing the speed of the turbine down.  Additionally it could also enable self starting of the turbine due to the angle of the lifting forces on the blades. \r
\r
* Used the negative space reinforcement system.  Skein the model with a low fill setting to take advantage of this system.  The sections are actually sliced into pieces, placed very close together.  The proximity will cause it to be fused together during printing, and the strength of the system will depend on the shell thickness.\r
\r
* Improved the wing mounting on the top and base supports\r
\r
* Support and support-less atomic wing sections.  This will allow balanced placement of the sections.""" ;
