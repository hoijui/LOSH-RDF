function = "I am a big fan of the game Dead Space and Dead Space 2. I loved the design of the alien artifact known as the Marker. So I decided I wanted to make my own interpretation of the Marker based on hexagons, my favorite 2D shape. The Marker from Dead Space is a pair of extruded squares, my design is a trio of extruded hexagons."
