    okh:function """This is my take on a No-Hob Extruder. This was loosely derived from profezzorn's extruder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28430\r
however I only used the concept of using a bit, rather than a hobbed bolt. I basically redesigned each piece to make it more compact allowing a small bit more Y axis clearance. I also provided a lead-in chamfer for the filament on the main extruder body to keep from binding. The mounting pattern is designed with a Budashnozzle in mind. This is designed for 1.75 filament.\r
\r
Source files are SolidWorks files. I have included those, along with a STEP file of the full Assembly. STL files of the printed pieces are also included. I will update this a bit later with the full functionality explanation, BOM, and instructions.\r
\r
I tried to keep all hardware SAE except for the three screws for the Nema17. The hobbed bolt is replaced with a #115 Dremel bit that can be bought for ~$5 at WalMart. All bearings are standard R2 bearings, that way you don't have two different sizes. And it uses a floating barrel nut to tighten the hinge. This can be bought for cheap at Lowes in their hardware section in a furniture accessory drawer.\r

Qty:1) 10-24 Nylon inserted lock nut\r
Qty:1) #115 Dremel bit (Walmart ~$5)\r

Qty:3) 8-32 set screws 5/16" long\r
Qty:3) 8-32 machine screw hex nuts""" ;
