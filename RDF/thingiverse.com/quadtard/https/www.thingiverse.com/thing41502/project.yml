function: "This is my take on a No-Hob Extruder. This was loosely derived from profezzorn's extruder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28430\r\nhowever I only used the concept of using a bit, rather than a hobbed bolt. I basically redesigned each piece to make it more compact allowing a small bit more Y axis clearance. I also provided a lead-in chamfer for the filament on the main extruder body to keep from binding. The mounting pattern is designed with a Budashnozzle in mind. This is designed for 1.75 filament.\r\n\r\nSource files are SolidWorks files. I have included those, along with a STEP file of the full Assembly. STL files of the printed pieces are also included. I will update this a bit later with the full functionality explanation, BOM, and instructions.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep all hardware SAE except for the three screws for the Nema17. The hobbed bolt is replaced with a #115 Dremel bit that can be bought for ~$5 at WalMart. All bearings are standard R2 bearings, that way you don't have two different sizes. And it uses a floating barrel nut to tighten the hinge. This can be bought for cheap at Lowes in their hardware section in a furniture accessory drawer.\r\n\r\nBOM:\r\nQty:1) 1/4-20 SHCS 5/8\" length\r\nQty:1) 1/4-20 x 3/8\" dia x 5/8\" length barrel nut (Hillman Group item#137362; purchase at Lowes ~$1.15)\r\nQty:1) 10-24 FHCS 1-1/8\" length\r\nQty:1) 10-24 Nylon inserted lock nut\r\nQty:1) #115 Dremel bit (Walmart ~$5)\r\nQty:3) R2 bearings (1/8\"ID x 3/8\"OD x 5/32\"W)\r\nQty:1) 1/8\" dowel pin x 3/4\" long\r\nQty:3) 8-32 set screws 5/16\" long\r\nQty:3) 8-32 machine screw hex nuts"
