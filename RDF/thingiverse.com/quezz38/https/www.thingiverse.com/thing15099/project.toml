function = "I drew up some quick replacement jaws for small ratcheting clamps. \r\nThese have a 90Â° groove and teeth on one side for easily clamping round items.  \r\nThe other jaw has is angled to account for flex in the clamps.  This helps the jaws to clamp parallel.  Sorry these aren't parametric, it was just a quick Rhino sketch."
