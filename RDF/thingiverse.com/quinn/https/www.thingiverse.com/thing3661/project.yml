function: "I\\'m not sure what this is. Perhaps this is a cable organizer, perhaps a big napkin holder. I\\'ve also toyed with using it as a hook. You could hit people with it, but it\\'s unlikely to hurt them. Without a doubt it will hold down paper. You might be able to open some nuts by using this to smash them again a rock, if you give it a good amount of in-fill.\r\n\r\nIt\\'s definitely a thing, and therefore belongs on Thingiverse."
