    okh:function """So.. i made all these gears (see other u/l) and when I made the dioramas, there was no way to turn the gears from the outside. I consulted my favorite guru for ideas (that didnt involve me using a lathe to carve a worm gear) and we came up with this. So I designed it to match the tiny gears in my gear sheet (two at top) and the long ones are for 6 inch boxes, the small ones for 4 inch frames.. \r
i'm going to go print it on the lazor. hopefully it'll work. fingers crossed.""" ;
