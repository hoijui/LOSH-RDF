function: My iphone cover is called Spaghetti Mess as it is representing spaghetti. If you are a food lover like myself then ull love the spaghetti designed Iphone cover. It is protective and stylish. It will be noticable to everyone by its ways of curves and explosion of it, exactly what spaghetti is.
