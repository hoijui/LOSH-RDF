Even when the temp dips into the 50s or colder, the inside of my printer stays a balmy 85.  Printing at a warmish temperature definately improves the print quality, even when the garage isn't freezing. \r
\r
The useful STL is the 6 panel hooks tucked neatly together. I included an STL of 1 panel hook if someone  has another use for it.  Cad files, also.""" ;
