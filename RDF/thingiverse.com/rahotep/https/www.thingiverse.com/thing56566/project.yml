function: "These are panels and hooks for closing up the sides of my printer, the BfB 3Dtouch.  I did this,  and added a heater, so I can print in the winter in my garage.  Even when the temp dips into the 50s or colder, the inside of my printer stays a balmy 85.  Printing at a warmish temperature definately improves the print quality, even when the garage isn't freezing. \r\n\r\nThe useful STL is the 6 panel hooks tucked neatly together. I included an STL of 1 panel hook if someone  has another use for it.  Cad files, also."
