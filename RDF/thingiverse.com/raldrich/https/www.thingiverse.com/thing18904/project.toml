function = "A precision adjustable optical endstop holder for Prusa printers, with an integrated Z screw constraint bearing.\r\n\r\nI was finding that reaming out the slide hole could be quite a challenge, so I've incorporated triffid_hunter's bushing, to make things easier.\r\n\r\nI also added a matching Z screw constraint clamp for use on the other side of the printer."
