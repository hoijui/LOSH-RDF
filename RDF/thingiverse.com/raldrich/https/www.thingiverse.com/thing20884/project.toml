function = "A 40mm x 40mm x 34mm Planetary gearbox designed to be mounted to a Nema 17 motor.  It's gear ratio is 4.444:1 (40:9 for those who dislike decimals).\r\n\r\nVersion 2\r\n\r\nNow supports an M8 bolt for the output by default.\r\n\r\nChanging the output size no longer requires reprinting the entire assembly - just print the top half of the planet frame, and the cover.\r\n\r\nIf you want the M6 version, print m6_output.stl as well.\r\n\r\nIf you've already printed the M6 version, and want to convert it to M8, print m8_output.stl.\r\n\r\nWarning! This is difficult to print.  Unlike Jag's design it doesn't have a lot of overhangs, but the gear teeth require a lot of precision."
