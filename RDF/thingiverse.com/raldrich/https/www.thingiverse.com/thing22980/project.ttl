\r
A direct drive extruder designed for use with a Minebea geared stepper motor, a Makerbot drive wheel, and a MakerGear GrooveMount (or similar) hot end.\r
\r
All Electronics is out of the required motor - MPJA has a supply of them at a slightly higher price - http://www.mpja.com/prodinfo.asp?number=18840+MS\r
\r
From the very beginning with my printer, I've been fighting clearance issues with the extruder, which has prompted me to attempt a long series of different extruder designs.  I tried internal (ring) gears, a printed planetary gearbox, and a Legoâ„¢ (!!!) worm gear.  None were completely satisfactory.\r
\r
I was about to break down and spend $33 apiece (plus shipping) on gearbox motors from robotshop.com, when ezmobius linked a Minebea gearbox stepper in IRC which was selling for $6.50 + shipping (Many thanks, ezmobius).\r
\r
So, here you have my best effort for a compact extruder.\r
\r
My goals for it are (in order):\r
\r
1) Torque.  It must be able to drive 3mm filament.\r
Â Â Â Â So far, I've only tested it with PLA, but I've had no difficulty\r
Â Â Â Â extruding at average speeds.\r
\r
2) Reliability. It must never let the filament slip, or lose steps.\r
Â Â Â Â Once I figured out that I needed to reduce the retraction\r
Â Â Â Â speed to 10mm/s, it became quite reliable.\r
\r
3) Size. It must give me use of the full width of my print bed.\r
Â Â Â Â On the newer of my printers, which was built with an extra\r
Â Â Â Â 15mm width in the frame, I've achieved that goal.  On the\r
Â Â Â Â older printer, the frame will limit my width at high print\r
Â Â Â Â heights by around 10mm.\r
\r
4) Ease of setup.  I don't like adjusting bolt tension whenever I\r
Â Â Â Â change filament.\r
Â Â Â Â The makerbot drive wheel is designed for use with fixed idler\r
Â Â Â tension, and (when tested with other extruder designs)\r
Â Â Â Â allowed me to switch between PLA and ABS filament, with\r
Â Â Â Â .1mm difference in diameter, without having to readjust.\r
\r
5) Ease of maintenance.  I don't like taking an extruder apart to\r
Â Â Â Â clean it.\r
Â Â Â Â The back side of the extruder body is open, so that you can\r
Â Â Â Â clean the teeth of the drive wheel without even loosening\r
Â Â Â Â the idler.\r
Â Â Â Â The filament guide runs close between the idler and drive\r
Â Â Â Â wheel, to reduce the likelihood of jamming the the\r
Â Â Â Â extruder when switching filaments.\r
\r
After designing it, I found that arcol had started an indiegogo campaign to build drive wheels in various sizes, so I added another goal.\r
\r
6) It needs to accommodate either the makerbot MK7 drive\r
Â Â Â Â wheel, or the arcol hyena 11x5 drive wheel.\r
Â Â Â Â The current version adds a taper to the lower filament guide, which allows it to be used with either drive wheel.\r
\r
Motor:\r
Â Â Â Â  http://www.eminebea.com/en/product/rotary/steppingmotor/pm/gearbox/pg35l-d48.shtml \r
Â Â Â Â (available at http://www.mpja.com/prodinfo.asp?number=18840+MS , but you'll need a small gear puller or faucet puller to remove the vestigial gear).\r
\r
Drive wheel:\r
Â Â Â Â  http://store.makerbot.com/mk7-drive-gear.html or\r
Â Â Â Â  http://www.indiegogo.com/mini-hyena (the 11x5 version).\r
\r
Two variations are provided: One which fits a compact carriage (45mm in in the x-axis), and another which fits the standard Prusa carriage.\r
\r
Revisions:\r
Â Â Â Â Fixed the bridges in the carriage belt clips.\r
Â Â Â Â Increased the thickness of the carriage mount.\r
Â Â Â Â Increased the diameter of the igus bushing holes.\r
Â Â Â Â Added an (experimental) pocket for an LM8UU bearing to\r
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â each of the carriage rails.  I haven't tested this, and I'm\r
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â not sure if it will work to use only 2 LM8UU on a\r
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â carriage, but it saves plastic - consider yourself\r
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â warned.\r
Â Â Â Â Added bolt holes for a 40mm fan to the carriage.\r
Â Â Â Â Widened the openings in the LM8UU pockets.  Hopefully\r
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â it'll now actually be possible to get a bearing into them.\r
Â Â Â Â Moved the filament channel a bit closer to the drive wheel, and tapered the lower filament channel, in order to support arcol's "mini hyena" drive wheel.\r
Â Â Â Â Closed the outside of the extruder body, to prevent it from flexing as the filament is driven.""" ;
