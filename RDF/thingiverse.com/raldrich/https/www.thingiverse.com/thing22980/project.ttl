    okh:function """This is not the extruder you're looking for. If you're looking for the extruder referenced in Josef Prusa's i3 design, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24219 \r
\r
A direct drive extruder designed for use with a Minebea geared stepper motor, a Makerbot drive wheel, and a MakerGear GrooveMount (or similar) hot end.\r
\r
All Electronics is out of the required motor - MPJA has a supply of them at a slightly higher price - http://www.mpja.com/prodinfo.asp?number=18840+MS\r
\r
From the very beginning with my printer, I've been fighting clearance issues with the extruder, which has prompted me to attempt a long series of different extruder designs.  I tried internal (ring) gears, a printed planetary gearbox, and a Legoâ„¢ (!!!) worm gear.  None were completely satisfactory.\r
\r
I was about to break down and spend $33 apiece (plus shipping) on gearbox motors from robotshop.com, when ezmobius linked a Minebea gearbox stepper in IRC which was selling for $6.50 + shipping (Many thanks, ezmobius).\r
\r
So, here you have my best effort for a compact extruder.\r
\r
My goals for it are (in order):\r
\r
1) Torque.  It must be able to drive 3mm filament.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0So far, I've only tested it with PLA, but I've had no difficulty\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0extruding at average speeds.\r
\r
2) Reliability. It must never let the filament slip, or lose steps.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Once I figured out that I needed to reduce the retraction\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0speed to 10mm/s, it became quite reliable.\r
\r
3) Size. It must give me use of the full width of my print bed.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0On the newer of my printers, which was built with an extra\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa015mm width in the frame, I've achieved that goal.  On the\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0older printer, the frame will limit my width at high print\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0heights by around 10mm.\r
\r
4) Ease of setup.  I don't like adjusting bolt tension whenever I\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0change filament.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0The makerbot drive wheel is designed for use with fixed idler\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0tension, and (when tested with other extruder designs)\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0allowed me to switch between PLA and ABS filament, with\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0.1mm difference in diameter, without having to readjust.\r
\r
5) Ease of maintenance.  I don't like taking an extruder apart to\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0clean it.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0The back side of the extruder body is open, so that you can\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0clean the teeth of the drive wheel without even loosening\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0the idler.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0The filament guide runs close between the idler and drive\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0wheel, to reduce the likelihood of jamming the the\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0extruder when switching filaments.\r
\r
After designing it, I found that arcol had started an indiegogo campaign to build drive wheels in various sizes, so I added another goal.\r
\r
6) It needs to accommodate either the makerbot MK7 drive\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0wheel, or the arcol hyena 11x5 drive wheel.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0The current version adds a taper to the lower filament guide, which allows it to be used with either drive wheel.\r
\r
Motor:\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0 http://www.eminebea.com/en/product/rotary/steppingmotor/pm/gearbox/pg35l-d48.shtml \r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0(available at http://www.mpja.com/prodinfo.asp?number=18840+MS , but you'll need a small gear puller or faucet puller to remove the vestigial gear).\r
\r
Drive wheel:\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0 http://store.makerbot.com/mk7-drive-gear.html or\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0 http://www.indiegogo.com/mini-hyena (the 11x5 version).\r
\r
Two variations are provided: One which fits a compact carriage (45mm in in the x-axis), and another which fits the standard Prusa carriage.\r
\r
Revisions:\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Fixed the bridges in the carriage belt clips.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Increased the thickness of the carriage mount.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Increased the diameter of the igus bushing holes.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Added an (experimental) pocket for an LM8UU bearing to\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0each of the carriage rails.  I haven't tested this, and I'm\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0not sure if it will work to use only 2 LM8UU on a\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0carriage, but it saves plastic - consider yourself\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0warned.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Added bolt holes for a 40mm fan to the carriage.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Widened the openings in the LM8UU pockets.  Hopefully\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0it'll now actually be possible to get a bearing into them.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Moved the filament channel a bit closer to the drive wheel, and tapered the lower filament channel, in order to support arcol's "mini hyena" drive wheel.\r
Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Âxa0Closed the outside of the extruder body, to prevent it from flexing as the filament is driven.""" ;
