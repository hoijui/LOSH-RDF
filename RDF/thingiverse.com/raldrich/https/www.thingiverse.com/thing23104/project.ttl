    okh:function """When rebuilding my lasercut wooden printer, I decided that one of the things that could use improvement over the Prusa design was the bar clamps.\r
\r
Now that the Y carriage is non-adjustable, the position of the Y axis smooth rods relative to the frame is critical, and the Prusa style bar clamps don't do a good job of enforcing the spacing between the two rods.\r
\r
I looked at the original (Sells mendel) Bar clamps, and decided that with 3 parts, they were more complicated than I liked, so I designed these as a replacement.\r

Revisions:\r
