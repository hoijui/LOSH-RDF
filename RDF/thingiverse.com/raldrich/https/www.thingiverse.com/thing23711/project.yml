function: "This is not the extruder you're looking for. If you're looking for the extruder referenced in Josef Prusa's i3 design, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24219 \r\n\r\nA dual version of my compact extruder.\r\n\r\nThe only issue I've had with the design so far is that getting the nozzles to the same height is both critical, and difficult, and requires the addition of shims between the groove mount plate, and the carriage.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think that the solving the alignment issue may require changing to a \"Vertical X\" carriage style, so that the point where the extruder is mounted to the carriage is separated from where the hot end is mounted to the extruder."
