function: "A short screwdriver, with 7 interchangeable bits.\r\n\r\nI've been looking for an interchangeable bit screwdriver with the metric allen wrenches and such that I use on the printer for some time now, and hadn't found it.\r\n\r\nI found a 100 piece boxer power tool set at Fry's, for $16, which had all of the bits I needed in it, and a magnetic coupler, for use in an electric drill.\r\n\r\nWith a printed handle, and some tiny magnets, I now have exactly the screwdriver I was looking for."
