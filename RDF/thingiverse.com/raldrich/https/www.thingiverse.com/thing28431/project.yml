function: "Version 0.5\r\n\r\nAkimbo is a redesigned Mendel frame, designed with increased build area, dual extrusion, easier assembly and increased rigidity in mind.\r\n\r\nThe top of the frame is tilted outward, to increase the frame's rigidity, and to keep carriage and extruder parts from banging into the frame at the top of the build area.\r\n\r\nThe space between the top horizontal bars is increased to 100mm, to allow clearance for placing the motors on top, and to keep the belt on a horizontal X carriage from rubbing against the frame at the top of the build area.\r\n\r\nThe frame is designed to be squared entirely with simple jigs, and uses parts that enforce frame geometry whenever possible.\r\n\r\nAll axis use a hybrid design for their movement - LM8UU (or equivalent) on one smooth rod, to provide maximum constraint, and a pair of 683 (3mm x 7mm x 3mm) roller bearings on the other smooth rod, to prevent binding.\r\n\r\nThe design supports 2 separate tool carriages, which allows 2 extruders with different hot-end lengths to be used on the same printer, and allows one extruder to be parked offsides while the other is in use."
