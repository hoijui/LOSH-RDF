function = "I teach Linear Algebra to a small class of High School students.  We took a few days to learn openSCAD and use the multmatrix function to explore some \"real world applications\".\r\n\r\nThe kids in the class had no prior programming experience and I think openSCAD was a great way for them to learn some of the basics of programming.\r\n\r\nTheir homework assignment was to design two objects, a building and a tree, by writing their own transformation modules using the multmatrix function (i.e. no using the built in rotate, translate, etc. functions, although union, difference, intersection were ok). Here are their buildings."
