\r
The kids in the class had no prior programming experience and I think openSCAD was a great way for them to learn some of the basics of programming.\r
\r
Their homework assignment was to design two objects, a building and a tree, by writing their own transformation modules using the multmatrix function (i.e. no using the built in rotate, translate, etc. functions, although union, difference, intersection were ok). Here are their buildings.""" ;
