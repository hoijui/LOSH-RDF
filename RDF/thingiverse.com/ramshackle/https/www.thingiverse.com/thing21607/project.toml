function = "This is my first thing!\r\n\r\nOk, it's not very interesting, useful, or practical, but I needed practice stitching two stl files together for Dualstrusion. I thought I'd share the file, because maybe someone else might like it- or find it useful.I'm afraid that I currently only know how to use Rhino 3D... which most definitely is not open source. I've included the file, and I'll also include the vector trace that I made of the MakerBot logo for others to enjoy.\r\n\r\nI'll upload a .svg file of the outline as soon as I have access to Adobe Illustrator."
