    okh:function """The board game Mississippi Queen ( http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/256/the-mississippi-queen ) comes with player pieces that aren't well designed. This is a better design that accommodates two small six-sided dice (instead of the little stickered wheels).\r
\r
Aside from that, it's an excellent test print: it should snugly fit two dice, it has thin walls, infill, can be printed in about 10 minutes, and if it's going to fail you can tell pretty early.""" ;
