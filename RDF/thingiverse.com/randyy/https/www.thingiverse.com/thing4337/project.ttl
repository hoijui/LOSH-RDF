\r
I liked BrokenToaster's idea of a bearing-driven filament spool holder, but that version was too big to fit on a Makerbot print bed.  I separated the arms from the hub, making a tight-fitting dovetail joint to connect the pieces without any hardware.  It now fits on a Makerbot print bed!!!\r
\r
\r
EDIT:  At Wajazn's suggestion, I added a version that integrates a printable bearing from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4312  .  Disclaimer, I have NOT tried to print it, but it should work.\r
\r
UPDATE:  (1/22/2011) I added a solid version of the integrated bearing hub that has no spokes to avoid the problem people were having with one of the hollows printing solid.  I just skeined it in 0035 and it looks good.""" ;
