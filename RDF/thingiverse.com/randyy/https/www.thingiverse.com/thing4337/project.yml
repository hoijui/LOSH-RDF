function: "Depreciated:  This item has been replaced by version 2, a 100% printable spool holder, located at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8317   Please refer to that file, which is a much better design. \r\n\r\nI liked BrokenToaster's idea of a bearing-driven filament spool holder, but that version was too big to fit on a Makerbot print bed.  I separated the arms from the hub, making a tight-fitting dovetail joint to connect the pieces without any hardware.  It now fits on a Makerbot print bed!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:  At Wajazn's suggestion, I added a version that integrates a printable bearing from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4312  .  Disclaimer, I have NOT tried to print it, but it should work.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  (1/22/2011) I added a solid version of the integrated bearing hub that has no spokes to avoid the problem people were having with one of the hollows printing solid.  I just skeined it in 0035 and it looks good."
