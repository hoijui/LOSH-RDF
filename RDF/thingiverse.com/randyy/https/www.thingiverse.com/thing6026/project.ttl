    okh:function """In honor of next week's Superbowl (and my team getting in), I thought I'd upload this kicking tee.  My son and I made one about two months ago.  We went from idea, to model, to a non-working prototype, to a redesigned and printed working model in about two hours.  Rapid prototyping is great!!!\r
\r
This kicking tee folds up flat so it can be carried in a backpack, and when it folds out, the legs positively stop in a 60 equilateral triangle and the arm locks out at 90 degrees.  We made it with 1/2" schedule 40 PVC we had at the house, but you can adjust the parameters in the attached SCAD for other supplies you have available.""" ;
