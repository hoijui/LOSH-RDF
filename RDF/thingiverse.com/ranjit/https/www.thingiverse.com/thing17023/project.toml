function = "After I added the tapered mouthpiece to the whistles, and with the hotdog-red ABS, these things remind me of a toy wienermobile I used to have.  Thus the name.  \nThis panflute is slightly more practical than the one it's derived from.  The curved shape is easier to use than the circle, and I added a bit of taper to the mouthpiece to make it easier to blow on a single whistle.  Still not a practical musical instrument, though!  \nThis one has a diatonic scale (CDEFGABC) instead of chromatic like the other one.  I had to learn the OpenSCAD lookup() function for that!"
