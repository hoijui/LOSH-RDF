function: "I had a 20 by 1.5 inch slab of oak, so I designed an ocarina that could be assembled from cross-sections that would fit on it.  It's crude but it really plays!  Video at http://www.flickr.com/photos/ranjit/4352330523/\r\n\r\nI sent around the wrong link for the 2011 roundrect ocarina! If you're looking for that, it's here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6182\r\n\r\nThis is part of my project to make a crude musical instrument every day in February. (More at moonmilk.com)"
