function: "This is a wooden whistle based on the traditional wooden organ pipe design.  The internal pieces are traced from an old organ pipe diagram; they can be laminated together between the two end caps to make a whistle that really whistles.\r\n\r\nThis was cut from 1/8\" basswood.\r\n\r\nUPDATE (May 2011): a full chromatic octave of 13 pipes - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8736\r\nAlso I changed the license from all rights reserved to CC-BY-SA."
