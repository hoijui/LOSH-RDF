function = "An improvised ocarina design - to my surprise, it worked on the first try.  Cut from a 3.5 x 11.5 inch slab of 1/4\" maple.  Check the video to hear what it sounds like: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ranjit/5423038441/\r\n\r\nWith the finger holes on the sides instead of the top, it's not as easy to play as my previous ocarina: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1816 - but it's way easier to assemble.\r\n\r\nThis is part of my project to make a crude musical instrument every day in February.
