function = "This is a crude but working violin made in an 8-bit, pixelated style.  Here's some videos of the thing in action: http://www.moonmilk.com/2011/04/17/8-bit-violin-played-by-real-fiddlers/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ranjit/6884531615/\r\n\r\n(It was on Make:Live on March 9th, 2011: http://makezine.com/live/)\r\n\r\nIt's laser-cut from 1/8\" plywood (front and back faces), 3/16\" plywood (bridge), and 1/4\" solid wood (everything else).  It's a messy design, and not fully refined, because I really didn't know what I was doing when I made it.  \r\n\r\nIf you make any substantial changes or improvements to this design that result in a working instrument, please publish your version of the design to Thingiverse and tell me about it.  And in general, if you make and/or perform with an instrument based on this design, I'd like to hear about it.\r\n\r\nThe document \"8bit violin scratchpad\" contains bitmap images I found on the net, and I don't claim any copyright on those."
