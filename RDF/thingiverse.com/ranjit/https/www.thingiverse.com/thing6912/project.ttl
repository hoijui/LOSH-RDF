(It was on Make:Live on March 9th, 2011: http://makezine.com/live/)\r
\r
It's laser-cut from 1/8" plywood (front and back faces), 3/16" plywood (bridge), and 1/4" solid wood (everything else).  It's a messy design, and not fully refined, because I really didn't know what I was doing when I made it.  \r
\r
If you make any substantial changes or improvements to this design that result in a working instrument, please publish your version of the design to Thingiverse and tell me about it.  And in general, if you make and/or perform with an instrument based on this design, I'd like to hear about it.\r
