function: "After I posted the organ pipe whistle http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:311 two years ago, I designed a full octave of pipes and told myself I'd post the files just as soon as I cleaned them up a little.  Well, it took a few years, but I finally got around to it.\r\n\r\nThese files contain 13 organ pipe whistles, not tuned to any particular standard, but they're pretty much in tune relative to each other.  The files are partly optimized to reduce the number of cuts by sharing long flat edges, but this means it's a bit more work to copy and paste single parts.\r\n\r\nDesign note - here's the silly way I tuned the 13 whistles: I started with a single whistle and copied it, and then doubled the length of the pipe above the fipple.  Then I put those two pipes on opposite ends of a wide document and drew a diagonal line between their tops.  I made 11 more copies of the pipe and distributed them equally between the little one and the big one, and then manually dragged their tops until they hit the diagonal line.  Instant equal-tempered scale!"
