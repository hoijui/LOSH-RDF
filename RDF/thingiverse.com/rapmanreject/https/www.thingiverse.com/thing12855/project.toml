function = "This is a one piece dual extruder plate that includes the linear bearing housings. To get rid of the spacer plate that goes between the extruder carriage and the extruder I countersunk the holes to allow a nut to fit between them. I have redesigned the unit to be printable using PLA and ABS so you can pick your preffered media. I have printed mine in PLA and ran it for a solid 24 hour 260c piece and it didnt not affect it.\r\n\r\nHowever it has gotten rid of a major portion of what appears as Z axis wobble, any cylindrical item I print comes out almost completly smooth."
