function = "This is another spider coupler I designed to eliminate \"z wobble\" (and for me a slightly bent threaded rod). Unlike similar designs, I found plastic & rubber spacers slightly  rigid. I have included a mold to fill with a substance of your choice (i used bathroom silicone). Although the silicone is soft, I have tested z travel with a dial gauge and its spot on. I don't have the hardware sizes I used (sorry), but it is the standard Printrbot shipped hardware. I left the tolerances a little tight so it will require some cleaning."
