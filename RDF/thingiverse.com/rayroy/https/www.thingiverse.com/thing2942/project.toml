This simple yet elegant mount accepts two fifth gen iPod nanos enabling the creator to record their daily webvlogs in glorious stereoscopic 3D video.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of its practical application!\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uC4OnRAmbo\r\nI do not have a makerbot to print out one of these puppies but the video shows you all you need to understand the implications of this.\r\n\r\nI will use the $#!7 out of a makerbot, I am about to be a father (due date, MAY 5!!!) baby toys, baby things, all things baby, i want to print them in 3D on a makerbot.  Also on my 3rd waste veg oil powered bus conversion tour, with lovely wife and baby too, many useful and fun things will need to be made, rapidly.\r\n\r\nmakezine.com/go/makerbot\r\n\r\nLove,\r\nRay Roy"
