function: "You can print in 3D, how about recording video in 3D!?  This simple yet elegant mount accepts two fifth gen iPod nanos enabling the creator to record their daily webvlogs in glorious stereoscopic 3D video.\r\n\r\nHere is a video of its practical application!\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uC4OnRAmbo\r\nI do not have a makerbot to print out one of these puppies but the video shows you all you need to understand the implications of this.\r\n\r\nI will use the $#!7 out of a makerbot, I am about to be a father (due date, MAY 5!!!) baby toys, baby things, all things baby, i want to print them in 3D on a makerbot.  Also on my 3rd waste veg oil powered bus conversion tour, with lovely wife and baby too, many useful and fun things will need to be made, rapidly.\r\n\r\nmakezine.com/go/makerbot\r\n\r\nLove,\r\nRay Roy"
