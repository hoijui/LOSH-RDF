function: "It seems like the most reproduced thing has been the WHISTLE, simple, loads of fun, can be printed with the bead inside.  How about a mate for that musical instrument... the MINI MARACA, or for my purposes, a BABY RATTLE!\r\n\r\nThis baby rattle has a sacred geometry acoustic opening  with three \"crystal\" shaker beads printed right inside.\r\n\r\nThe hexagram fractal is the sacred structure of our universe, from the sub-micro to the super-macro, all religious symbology aside, these basic and universal geometric patterns are what I want my child to experience with his first interactive playthings.... made open source and with love, hopefully on a makerbot.\r\n\r\nOPEN SOURCE, make it better, please.\r\n\r\nenjoy,\r\nray roy\r\n\r\nmakezine.com/go/makerbot"
