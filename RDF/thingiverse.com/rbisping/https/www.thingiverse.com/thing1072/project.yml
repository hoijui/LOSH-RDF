function: "This should fit a 606 skate bearing it has a 22mm id and aprox 44mm od and should fit where the standard laser cut idler goes. It is a bit thicker than the laser cut (5mm) which i found works a bit better from having made one on a lathe to replace the original which i was having problems with.\r\n\r\nSo far i havent tried it in my extruder but I dont see why it wouldnt work :)"
