function: "mounting base and dino support for older model screwstruder design. I had a couple of them sitting around the house that i havent fully assembled for my origional repstrap so i threw together these to be able to at least posibly install one in my makerbot. \r\n\r\nnote that the dino should work for a regular plastruder or printruder but i havent printed any of this out yet."
