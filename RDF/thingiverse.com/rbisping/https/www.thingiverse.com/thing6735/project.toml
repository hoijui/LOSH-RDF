function = "modification to my old double feed mount to hold makergear hot ends. the retainer clamp is to follow. I designed it so you can either mount a single hot end at the center or two side by side. The origional plan was to have minimum clearance between both barrels but i changed my mind because if you bolt two of these together back to back you can mount 4 barrels all at 20mm center to center, wherease having them 16mm between centers then makes bolting them together asymetrical being 16mm one direction and 20mm the other. though the scad file is not parametric it is easy to change (and I may parameterize it eventualy)"
