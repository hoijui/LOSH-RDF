function = "For use with JAWong's brilliant 3D Catan tiles, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26979, this border is tinkered off of Triskite's \"Working Settles of Catan border in 2 prints,\" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21460. I have scaled it down vertically, which makes the joints print a little ugly but they still notch together, and added cutouts for Port Tiles.   \n\nNew 4mm version available (2013-3-29). It's not obvious in the pictures, but the road and city cutouts are a little higher, too.  \n\nThe inset tracks and circles will fit my Round Player Pieces, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:46065.  \n\nThe port holes are scaled to fit the original cardboard pieces or my own Catan Port Tiles, WIP at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53812.  \n\nThe 5-6 Player Expansion includes port tiles. (How-to-assemble picture soon.) If you're using this, you may also want 5-6 Player Number Tokens: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:70996"
