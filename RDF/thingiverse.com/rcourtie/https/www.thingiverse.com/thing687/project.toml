function = "LogiBloks is a board game to help 6-8th graders learn formal logic. The physical design of the game pieces allows children to learn formal logic and deductive reasoning without barriers of symbolic representation and syntax found in traditional formal logic curricula for older students.  \r\n\r\n        LogiBloks allow children to create propositions relevant to their own lives (as opposed to working with abstract variables). The blocks will provide a tool for distributed cognition, enabling students to both construct and deconstruct complex ideas and arguments via simple manipulation.\r\n\r\nDesigned by Rodolphe Courtier, Tom Nguyen and Andy Russell"
