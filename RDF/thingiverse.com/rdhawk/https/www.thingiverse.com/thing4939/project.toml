function = "This is the Snowtrooper/Snowtrooper Commander belt greeblie from The Empire Strikes Back. Drawn with SketchUp, the outer disc should measure 46mm across, while the smallest inner discs should be 18mm across. I don't have access to a 3D printer though, so I don't know how something like this would turn out. I would hope it would turn out well though."
