function = "A simple bracket for IKEA's awesome Jansjo LED gooseneck lamp.\r\n\r\nThe Jansjo lamp is perfect for focused lighting, I use a couple on my workbench to illuminate my printbed and shining a little extra light on electronics etc.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the desk version takes up valuable bench space and the clip version requires something to clip to (and is also much more expensive).\r\n\r\nThis thing is a quick hack to remedy that."
