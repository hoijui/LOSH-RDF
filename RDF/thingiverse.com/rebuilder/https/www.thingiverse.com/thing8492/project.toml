function = "I'm building what will likely turn out to be the ugliest cigar box ukulele ever, and found I didn't have any wood hard enough to do the job for the bridge, and the nut I had carved, too, looked a bit too fragile. Hopefully these will do the job.\r\n\r\nI've printed this and the parts seem to work. The \"instrument\" (I use the word loosely) I built is a soprano ukulele, you may want to tweak some things if you build a different size. You may need to tweak some stuff anyway, the height of the saddle and the nut being the first that come to mind, depending on your ukulele. \r\n\r\nThe saddle has no supports for attachment to the ukulele. I just glued it on and it seems to have stuck well enough. For a stronger structure, you'd want to make a back piece to put on the inside of the ukulele, extrude a couple of pegs from that and make corresponding holes on the bridge. I may do that if/when I get around to building another ukulele.\r\n\r\n \r\nIncluded is also the original Blender file which should be easier to edit than the STLs, if you can open it. I find when I open stl files imported from Blender in ReplicatorG, the models must be scaled to 0.5. I was expecting some factor of 10, but go figure."
