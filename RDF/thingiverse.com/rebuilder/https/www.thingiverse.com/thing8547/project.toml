function = "Having sat on an Ukulele, I decided the best way to avoid pesky repairwork would be to hang the instruments up where I can't crush them. This does the job.\r\n\r\nI've included two versions of the object as STL. One has a thicker base in case your ukulele head ends up needing to go through a wall if you try to mount it on the thinner one.  The thin version looks better, and for my instruments at least, I think would work even if I had mounted them on a wall instead of the top of a shelf as I did.\r\n\r\nIncluded is also the Blender file for these, which should be better suited for editing than the STLs."
