function = "This is a simplistic library that allows you to generate valid constructive solid geometry (CSG) hierarchies in Haskell and translate them to OpenSCAD syntax.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the library allows you to export any generated hierarchy using the show function. A nice objective would be to interface directly with OpenSCAD/CGAL methods to export directly to STL. \r\n\r\nGet the latest version from github: https://github.com/relet/scad.hs"
