function = "Seeing the other tesla valve, I was pretty certain that the same principle could be extended to 3D. I came across a more symmetric, optimized design of a tesla microvalve at http://www.senlin41.org/topology-optimization-of-tesla-type-microvalve/ and traced it. \r\n\r\nThe following is a trace of the optimized valve in openscad with added support to make it printable without overhang or flying parts. Parameters allow you to set the coarseness of the rotational extrusion ($fn=32 works fine for me), and the distance of the support bridges.\r\n\r\nI have not printed or tested that yet, so I suggest you start with the scad file and adapt it to your needs."
