function = "A simple access card holder, designed to hang on a lanyard with the top edge, while allowing quick access to a magnet stripe on the back left.\r\n\r\nFor cards in the standard format 85.6 x 54 mm.\r\n\r\nPrinted on a ToM, the card sticks quite nicely in the frame, and cannot fall out. Raftless printing makes for a smooth surface."
