function: "Most soap in the world is provided in the form of bars. Bars, that are deployed on grids or basins, that inevitably turn into a rather filthy, slimy affair. \r\n\r\nThis soap bar dispenser works differently. The soap bar is never in contact with water. Using the sled, you shave off flakes of soap from the bar. \r\n\r\n(Note - the dispenser in my picture was aborted in mid-print, because I ran out of ABS and changing the spool did not work as expected. The model dispenser is higher, and the scad file is parametric anyway.)\r\n\r\nThis thing is public domain, because caring is sharing and I am counting on the thingiverse hivemind to make this more awesome. Feel free to flattr me or any derivatives if this is useful for you."
