Thing 5945 claims to have all rights reserved on the extrusion of a logo that is in the public domain. I do not support this claim, but therefore do not provide the STL file for the biohazard sign. You can basically generate your own puzzle from the STL file of any \"coin\" type thing or with a little more work any other logo. There is a parameter (d=...) that allows to scale the extrusion depth to an useful level."
