function = "These are various parts of scent or water diffusers to be put on top of a radiator. \r\n\r\nOne is a grid, to put various well smelling condiments (cloves, orange peel) on top. \r\n\r\nThe other is a small tub, to put water or scented water in. \r\n\r\nVarious kinds of legs are provided, one of which just happens to match my radiators. \r\n\r\nIt also features a module for a hexagonal grid, just because it is cute."
