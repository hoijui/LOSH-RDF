function = "This OpenScad module allows you to generate models for arbitrary Burr puzzle pieces.\r\n\r\nThe bit pattern used for configuration is identical with the one on the following site: http://www.research.ibm.com/BurrPuzzles/index.html\r\n\r\nYou can use the Burr calculator on this site to calculate and print your own puzzles.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the file contains the burrx() module which allows the corner blocks on the lower level to be set. It basically extends the pattern to 4*L bits."
