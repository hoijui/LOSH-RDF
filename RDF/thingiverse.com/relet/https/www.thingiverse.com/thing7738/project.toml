You can plug pieces of frame onto the base to extend it, and to hold down the picture within.  \r\n\r\nI would probably make it (more) parametric and extendable in all dimensions, but I'll leave it WIP until I actually get around to it. \r\nYes, I am aware that I could just print a round Tuit myself. Thank you Thingiverse.\r\n\r\nPublic domain."
