function = "A parametric buckle for connecting and tensioning two flat lines. The knot shown in the picture slips in one direction only - if you apply tension to the inner of the two line ends. If the tension is equal or larger on the outer line, it is self-locking.\r\n\r\nNot safe for any purpose, but I tensioned mine (10mm bars, solid print) up to some 5kN. \r\n\r\nParameters:\r\n- Line width, bar diameter, overall length, tolerance\r\n- Offset from center (working with thick lines requires more spacing in the center)"
