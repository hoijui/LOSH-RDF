function = "This is a connector which uses 3mm makerbot magnets as the terminals.  The magnet are oriented so that their polarity allows all three terminals to contact in only one orientation.    I use these on my motorcycle to run 5V, GND, and signal between an arduino based GPS and an LCD with a serial board.  I designed it for a quick disconnect application, I use them on the bike this way to make sure they could deal with the vibration.  So far so good!"
