    okh:function """This is a breakout board for an arduino that boosts the 5v signal from the arduino output to a high-power 12v, suitable for running RepRap heaters, fans, heated beds, etc.\r
The IDC will plug into my Arduino Mega Shield ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3308 ) and the power socket is designed to accept standard PC disk drive power plugs.\r
\r
The signal from the arduino is amplified using a MOSFET - I used FDB8880 ( http://uk.farnell.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?SKU=1228327 ) at 60p each, which will handle 54A - which is way more current than I expect to ever need, or can be supplied from a single PC power supply.\r
There are also 8 separate outputs on the board - populate as many as you need. I'm a big believer in multiple redundancy.\r
\r
It's a nice simple board and it is a good introduction to SMD soldering - each output is separate, so you can mess up one circuit and still use the other 7. I'm also not the most skilled or tidiest maker, and I managed to make it work :-).""" ;
