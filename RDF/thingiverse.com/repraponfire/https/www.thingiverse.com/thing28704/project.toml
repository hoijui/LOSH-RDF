function = "I didn't like the sound of my cheap LM8UU bearings. So I disassembled my machine again and replaced them with IGUS RJMP-01-08 bearings. This is the holder for the Y-Axis. \r\n\r\nIt is a Derivative of jonaskuehling's great LM8UU Holder. I changed wall thickness and form to print it whith PLA more easily.\r\n\r\nI use them for a month now and I had no problems so far."
