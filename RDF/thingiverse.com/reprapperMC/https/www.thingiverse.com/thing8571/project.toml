function = "After miserably failing at using zip ties to set up a webcam on my printer I figured it was time to make a solid mount for it. This webcam mount was made for a Logitech C510 but can probably be used on other webcams.\r\n\r\nThe design is based on Auzze's webcam mount: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8350\r\n\r\nAuzze's seemed solid however the screw on the camera side of the mount would not work for my camera. So I changed the screw placing around and in the process created a parametric camera mount scad file.\r\n\r\nMost of the settings are clearly marked and can be changed. However, the scad file needs the OpenSCAD Parts Library found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6021"
