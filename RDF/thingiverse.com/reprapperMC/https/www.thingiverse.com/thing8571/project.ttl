\r
The design is based on Auzze's webcam mount: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8350\r
\r
Auzze's seemed solid however the screw on the camera side of the mount would not work for my camera. So I changed the screw placing around and in the process created a parametric camera mount scad file.\r
\r
Most of the settings are clearly marked and can be changed. However, the scad file needs the OpenSCAD Parts Library found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6021""" ;
