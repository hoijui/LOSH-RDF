Now - you can either shove the coffee into the coffee machine with your bare hands, or you can print out this coffee dosing spoon.\r\n\r\nAfter several attempts for differents container forms I stuck with the cone form, because it was the only one I could get closed at the bottom.\r\n\r\nAs an additional feature I put a hole into the handle, so after you are finished you can hang it on a hook or a nail."
