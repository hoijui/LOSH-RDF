function = "Menger sponges (or cubes, whatever) are interesting objects. \r\n\r\nThe really interesting question is what the cross section looks like if you cut it in half. \r\n\r\nNo! not like that! Cut it in half perpendicular to a body diagonal!\r\n\r\nNow try to imagine the outline and the inside outlines..... \r\n\r\nAnyway. Menger cubes get complicated really, really quickly. Apparently openscad can handle a level two just fine, but level 3 is beyond the capacity of my computer. Oh well."
