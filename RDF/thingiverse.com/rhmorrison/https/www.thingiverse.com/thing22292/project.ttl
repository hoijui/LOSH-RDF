by Think_3D and the SIMPLE SPOOL HOLDER FOR MENDEL which I liked very well but it had some problems.  The main problem was due to the fact that the spool is so low and far back that the filament would rub against the threaded bar which was not good.  There are quite a number of different solutions to this problem, mine was the Mendel Filament Guide which is the ancestor of this thing.  It snapped onto the top of the Mendel and allowed using left over round bar as a guide so the filament didn't rub against the threaded bar.  This served its purpose but as one Thingiverse user pointed out required round bar that he didn't have on hand.  It also proved something else; my snapin design worked very well.  Then a couple of weeks ago I saw the Over The Top Spool Holder V2 by BackyardWorkshop and thought that this was very similar to my snap-on filament guide.  I especially liked the idea that the spool was mounted above and not as far behind such that the filament went straight down.  That thing had to be held by M8 nuts and I thought I could improve upon that so I started with my Mendel Filament Guide thing and then decided where I wanted the center of the filament spool to be relative to the guide holder and put it there.  Then I added to circular support struts such that the snap-in capability wasn't lost and then added a support circle with the RepRap LOGO.""" ;
