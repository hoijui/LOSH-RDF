function = "This is the Georgia Institute of Technology (GA Tech) logo that I printed for my favorite EE Professor Dr. John B. Peatman.\r\n\r\nIt was created starting with the GaTechYellowJacket.gif file that I downloaded from the Internet (because it was a nice 3 color logo).  From this image I used GIMP http://www.gimp.org to create two black and white images (GaTechYellowJacket-Yellow.jpg and GaTechYellowJacket-Black.jpg) and then I uploaded these to the Shapeways and used their 2D to 3D tool http://www.shapeways.com/creator/2d_to_3d/ to create two STL files (GaTechYellowJacket-Yellow.stl and GaTechYellowJacket-Black.stl).  These I then combined using the OpenSCAD http://www.openscad.org script (GaTechYellowJacket.scad) with a square (or round) backplate, then the yellow layer and finally the black layer on top.\r\n\r\nThis is then the different STL files: GaTechYellowJacket-Square-18x18.stl, GaTechYellowJacket-Round-18.stl, GaTechYellowJacket-Square.stl and GaTechYellowJacket-Round.stl. The one I printed for John as a present was the first one (GaTechYellowJacket-Square-18x18.stl)."
