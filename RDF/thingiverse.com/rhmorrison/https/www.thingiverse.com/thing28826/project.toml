function = "I saw the Makerbot Business Card Displayer (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1050) and liked the design but wanted to add my own logos so I took the STL and used OpenSCAD to remove the logo and make a plain business card holder that can then be modified with any logo that you want.  I used embossed instead of raised and have so far created a Microchip, K2L and FWB branded business card holders."
