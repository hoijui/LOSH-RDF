function: "A friend of mine has a handicapped friend that has almost no strength in his hands and it is very difficult for him to turn a key in a lock so this tool is to provide him the necessary leverage to be able to turn the key.\r\n\r\nThere is a new product from KeySmart that I think presents a better solution to the key problem for people that need assistance for turning their keys.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.getkeysmart.com/products/keysmart-ext"
