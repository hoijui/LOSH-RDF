function = "We bought two side tables for use with our recliners the idea being that their would be one for myself and one for my wife.  Unfortunately we didn't have enough space to place two tables and two recliners side-by-side so we ended up putting two tables together.  Now we have a house cat (who is no light weight) that loves to jump on tables.  It doesn't take much weight in the wrong place to tip over a table with three legs.  Since we hat the tables together where two legs of one table were right next to two legs of the other table I decided to come up with a clamp to connect the legs together giving us a single table with six legs which is much more stable.  I used four clamps, two on the bottom and two on the top and now the cat can jump on the table to his hearts desire and still not tip it over - of course that still doesn't prevent him from knocking everything off the table but it's a start."
