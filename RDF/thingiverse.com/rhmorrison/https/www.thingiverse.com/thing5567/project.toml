function = "This is a model stand that I built to display the Tie Interceptor model (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5549) that I printed out. It uses the Global Dynamics Logo by Modelmaker and does some modification: resizing, rotation and copying to create an open pyramid where one can display a model.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the file only has a 3mm hole in the top so you can use any piece of filament that you want to adjust the height to."
