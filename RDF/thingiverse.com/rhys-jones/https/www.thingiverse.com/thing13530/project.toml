function = "On the standard eMaker Huxley extruder drive block, the filament is unsupported for quite a while before it reaches the hobbed bolt.  I found that if my filament spool wasn't running perfectly, it was possible for the filament to slip off the hobbed bolt/bearing during a print. This modification supports the filament for longer and hopefully stops this happening."
