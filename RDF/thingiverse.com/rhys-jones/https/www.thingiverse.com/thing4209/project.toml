function = "The previous Mendel X bracket was compact, but led the toothed belt along a tortuous path with tight radii and reverses of direction. I've had the X axis belt snap (which costs far too much!), after just 4 sets of Mendel parts, and others have told me the same. With this, the design is larger, but less prone to belt failure. We've printed about 8 Mendels with it now with no sign of belt wear."
