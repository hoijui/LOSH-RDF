function: "So I'm sat in my workshop playing around with my printer and doing some sorting out whilst I'm at it.\r\n\r\nI have a scrap of wood that I think will make a useful little shelf but I don't have any shelf supports.\r\n\r\nDing goes a light bulb above my head so applying a little learning about freecad and a few minutes later it's on the wall :)"
