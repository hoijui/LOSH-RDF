function = "Decided to make an even stronger shelf support. Very impressed by the rigidity of the print.  \n\nThis is a design inspired by a failed print of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34422. The object came unstuck just after the printing the bottom half. I was so impressed by the strength of the unfinished print I decided to make my own design that was half the size but also with a much larger surface area on the print bed to try to stop the object moving during print.  \n\nPlease Note: The brackets I've printed with PLA have flowed somewhat in the hot environment of my workshop (30-40C) so I'm reprinting in ABS which should last longer. Just something to be aware of."
