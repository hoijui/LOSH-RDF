function: "There are many cryptex models around, but this one can be set to any 5 letter word you want.  \r\n\r\n*** NEW ***\r\nIf you have a larger print bed than my little 120mm one you can now print 6 or 7 letter cryptex! Just use cryptex_central_support_6 and cryptex_core_tube_6 for 6 letters and their _7 versions for 7. Dont forget to print extra letter rings.\r\n\r\nNEW: Alternative skull end, a combination of the original ball end and thing:11953 - elvis the printable skull. Perfect for a pirate themed cryptex. NOTE: Print at 50% size to match the rest of the parts (CAD package would not shrink Elvis)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew2: Ring2 now features anti-pick features. This makes trying to guess the code by testing the resistance of the rings to turning much more difficult.   \r\n\r\nFolk who have already printed ring2 can add these features by filling 0.5mm groves into the sides.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative ring1 added with reversed letters for easier printing. I found this more difficult to get a good paint finish, but I'm not too good with a brush. Print with inlay versions of locking ring and spacer ring."
