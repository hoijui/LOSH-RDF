function = "This is my copy of the famous Szilassi polyhedron, resized for RepRap printers, including the Huxley.\r\nThis unusual mathematical shape has the topology of a doughnut but using only 7 faces and 14 edges. Each of the 7 faces shares an edge with every other face, proving that 7 colours are required for mapping on a toroid."
