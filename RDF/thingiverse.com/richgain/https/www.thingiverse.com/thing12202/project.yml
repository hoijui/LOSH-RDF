function: "This model started life as a bronze statue in my parents' house. I took photos and uploaded them using the Photofly software at http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/photo_scene_editor/ to create an .OBJ file. I then closed up any holes using NetFabb Studio's repair function and then cropped and resized the model in Blender to make a printable bust.\r\nUnbelievable technology and all free. Huge thanks to all the developers."
