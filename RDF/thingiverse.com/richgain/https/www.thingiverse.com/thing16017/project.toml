function = "This ornament is a reproduction of the tree used on the stage set for Imogen Heap's 2010 Ellipse tour. In the photo which shows two models, the one on the left was produced by Shapeways in laser-sintered nylon and cost about Â£15 in November 2010. The one on the right was printed in ABS on my eMaker Huxley for about 20 pence."
