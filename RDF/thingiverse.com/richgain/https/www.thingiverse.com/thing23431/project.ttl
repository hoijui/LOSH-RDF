I made one of these and thought it was a brilliant idea but I wasn't happy with the design so I made some improvements to suit my needs.\r
1. The lens is a push fit and needs no glue.\r
2. The adapter has been resized to fit over my iPhone4S case so I don't have to remove it to use the macro.\r
3. The top edge was thin and fragile over the flash hole. Since the flash overpowers close-up shots I never use it, so I removed the extra hole.\r
4. Now that the lens doesn't need glue, the hole in the upper layer is redundant. I have closed it off and added a small bump to grip the the front glass. This can be manoeuvred over the top edge of the case.\r
5. I made the rounded corners much smaller to overcome the nasty overhangs that distorted the first few layers.\r
I am a complete OpenSCAD noob so please excuse my poor code but I decided to be brave and share it since it did use it and it did actually work!""" ;
