function: "I found this beautiful high resolution scan of the head of Venus de Milo at http://www.deskproto.com/support-videos/videos-venus.php and was quite surprised that it hadn't found its way onto Thingiverse yet.\r\n\r\nTheir website does state that the STL file may not be offered for downloading (thanks to TheRuttMeister for pointing this out) so I have removed my derivative file and recommend that you go to their site and download it directly from them or use this link http://www.deskproto.com/files/venus-stl.zip"
