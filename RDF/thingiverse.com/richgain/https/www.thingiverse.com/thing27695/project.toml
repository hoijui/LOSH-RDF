function = "Many puzzle pieces have complex shapes with inevitable overhangs whichever way you orient them. I would like to try soluble support material but I don't yet have dual extruder printing capability. Ordinary support material leaves nasty marks on the downward-facing surfaces.\r\n\r\nMy latest idea was to split the piece horizontally through the middle and print the two halves facing upwards with a custom connecting joint on top of each piece. The joint consists of a triangular peg next to a triangular hole, all contained within the outline of a single cube.\r\nThe prototype was first modelled in Tinkercad and then transferred to OpenSCAD for easier customisation.\r\nWatch the video of the first test at http://youtu.be/Fp63gR9HTJA\r\n\r\n**Update April 2019** - make sure you check out Aaron Siegel's fabulous [Puzzlecad](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3198014) which takes this idea to the next level."
