function: "This dramatic statue is in the Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden in the Washington DC mall.\r\nhttp://dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0000455.htm\r\nI selected it partly for the interesting subject matter and partly because it looked pretty printable, with no serious overhangs.\r\nI took 30 high resolution photos from all around the statue and uploaded them using 123D Catch to make the model."
