function: "I created this little tool so when I was modeling I could remember what the radius was suppose to be when I needed to embed nuts.  Mostly this was a test thing to upload but someone else might find it useful.\r\n\r\nTo get the black on clear plexi-glass look.  I left the protective cover on the plexi-glass.  After etching and cutting was done I spray painted black over the whole part.  Let it try and then removed the protective cover.  I used a small hobby exacto knife for the little bits of letters."
