function: "This is a small laser cut tool that allows you to scoop inside of the milling table to remove bits of metal that fall down inside.  I have a Grizzly G0463 Metal Mill however I should think that his part will work for any similar mill table.  To include Harbor Freight's version of the x3 mill.\r\n\r\nMill:\r\nhttp://grizzly.com/products/Mill-Drill/G0463\r\n\r\nThe font used is ECO Files its a free font you can download here:\r\nhttp://wareseeker.com/Home-Shell-Desktop/eco-files-1.zip/3515059\r\n\r\nMaterial was 1/8 Hardboard (masonite) but you could use any material that you think is strong enough to hold up to multiple uses."
