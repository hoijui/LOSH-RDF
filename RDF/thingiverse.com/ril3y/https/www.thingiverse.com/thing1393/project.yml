function: "This is and end mill laser cut holder for the 10 piece grizzly end mill set seen here:  http://www.grizzly.com/products/g9757\r\n\r\nI use 3/4\" x 3/4\" x 1/16\" aluminum for the supports or columns.  This is a method that I invented.  I call this self threading square tube insert method.  The 4 holes on the masonite (hard board) are exactly positioned so that when they are all screwed in they \"self thread\" into the aluminum corners.  The use of longer bolts will give a stronger hold.  However for this project I used  2x 1\" bolts and 2x 1/4\" socket head screws.  \r\n\r\nThe masonite used is 1/8\".  The top layer consists of 2 sheets identically cut (minus the engraving on the 2nd one).  The first bottom layer is exactly the same as the top (minus the engraving).  This allows for the end mills to \"slide\" into place and not move around.  The last layer is the file that has the work \"bottom\" in it.  It basically is only the outline and no end mill holes."
