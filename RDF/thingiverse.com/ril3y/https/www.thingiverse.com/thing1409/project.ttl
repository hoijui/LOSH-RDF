\r
I tested this board by hooking up an 5v arduino + GND then ran a magnetic strip over the IC.  The activity light started blinking!  So it looks like everything is working.  This is also my first board I have laid out that was a double sided board converted to a single.  Some places are "tight" but its doable.  I have ohm'ed out all my connections and everything is great.\r
