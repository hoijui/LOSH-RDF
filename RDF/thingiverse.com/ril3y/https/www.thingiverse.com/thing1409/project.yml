function: "This is a single Sided approach to this board.  But the version 1.1V thats in the makerbot SVN. \r\n\r\nI tested this board by hooking up an 5v arduino + GND then ran a magnetic strip over the IC.  The activity light started blinking!  So it looks like everything is working.  This is also my first board I have laid out that was a double sided board converted to a single.  Some places are \"tight\" but its doable.  I have ohm'ed out all my connections and everything is great.\r\n\r\nVideo of it in action here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/31697990@N00/4170462649/\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\nRil3y"
