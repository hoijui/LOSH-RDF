function = "This elephant, dressed for a performance, started as a 123D Catch scan of a Schleich model.  The resulting object was cleaned, repaired and modified to ease printing using Autodesk Meshmixer. The parade blanket and forehead medallion were also added in Meshmixer. Can print without  ramp or supports, depending on your printer."
