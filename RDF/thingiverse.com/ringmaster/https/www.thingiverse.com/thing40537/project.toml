function = "This is the horse that is pulling my Circus Commissary wagon in the photo attached to that model. It started life as a DAZ/POSER horse but it has been substantially modified. Tack was applied using Autodesk 123D, combined and cleaned with Meshmixer.DAZ models are very dirty for creating .stl files because they contain lots of baggage relating to rigging and posing components.  Not easy to adapt.\r\nThe model is scaled to print at approximately 1/4 inch per ft."
