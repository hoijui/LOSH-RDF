function: This model is an approximation of the Wurlitzer or Tangley Calliope or Calliaphone, a favorite of circuses and river boats.  Purists will note that our model is short about two ranks of pipes, only 28 well short of the 42 or 43 whistles of the typical instrument.  I have included two .stl files.  One is the instrument alone as shown in the picture.  The second is a scene with the maestro hard into his rendition.
