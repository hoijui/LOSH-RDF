    okh:function "This model of the Ringling Bros. Air Calliope wagon No. 2 was made from a plan in the July-August 1997 â€œLittle Circus Wagonâ€, the official publication of Circus Model Builders International.  It is in kit form to facilitate printing and preserving maximum detail.  A .jpg of the graphics can also be down loaded to paste on the wagon to complete the detail.  The high relief scrolls on the sky boards were created using â€œPhotoToMeshâ€ from Ransen Software as were the curved window in the sides of the wagon.  Modeling was done in Autodesk 123D Beta and modified in Autodesk Meshmixer. The .sla files are sized for a scale of 1/4-inch = 1 foot.  I have also printed it at 2x scale, and that is the model in the picture.  At half scale (~HO) wheels, brake wheel, and flag posts will probably not print acceptably." ;
