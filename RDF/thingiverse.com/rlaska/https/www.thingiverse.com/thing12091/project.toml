function = "Update 2018: I designed this way back in 2011, years and years before I had access to an actual 3d printer. I finally printed this model in November, and I've uploaded pictures of it.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions and shape are as accurate as I know how to make it. If anyone has access to an actual hero prop or can point out more accurate build instructions, I'll take a crack at updating it. The specifications I used to build this model are now tragically gone forever, due to the Star Trek Continues site being pulled (and I can't find a copy of that particular forum entry in archive.org)\r\n\r\nThanks for being a slime, CBS.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDon't have a 3d printer yet, but I thought I'd start getting my feet wet in Sketchup.\r\nThis is an accurate model of the Star Trek Original Series data cards (seen being used with the \"library computers\" and terminals in many episodes) based on the info on this forum post: http://forums.startreknewvoyages.com/index.php?topic=7512.0\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nAfter comparing against the actual show, I found that the data cards/micro tapes were actually rounded on both sides. I've produced style \"B\" accordingly."
