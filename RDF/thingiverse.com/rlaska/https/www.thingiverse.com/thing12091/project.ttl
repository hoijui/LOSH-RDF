\r
The dimensions and shape are as accurate as I know how to make it. If anyone has access to an actual hero prop or can point out more accurate build instructions, I'll take a crack at updating it. The specifications I used to build this model are now tragically gone forever, due to the Star Trek Continues site being pulled (and I can't find a copy of that particular forum entry in archive.org)\r
\r
Thanks for being a slime, CBS.\r

Don't have a 3d printer yet, but I thought I'd start getting my feet wet in Sketchup.\r
This is an accurate model of the Star Trek Original Series data cards (seen being used with the "library computers" and terminals in many episodes) based on the info on this forum post: http://forums.startreknewvoyages.com/index.php?topic=7512.0\r
\r
Update:\r
After comparing against the actual show, I found that the data cards/micro tapes were actually rounded on both sides. I've produced style "B" accordingly.""" ;
