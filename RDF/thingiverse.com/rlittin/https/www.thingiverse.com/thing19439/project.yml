function: "Replacement anemometer cups for La Crosse 2350 weather station.\r\n\r\nThe guy replacing my TV ariel hit the wind meter cups and they shattered as they were very brittle.  This is an attempt to replace them with my own 1 piece printed copy.\r\n\r\nSome evidence that it is working can be seen in the screen shot of my personal weather web page - the yellow plot at the bottom."
