function: "This is my variation on the Rostock printer.  It is pretty much Johann's original design with the following changes:\r\n\r\n1) Braid fishing line instead of belts for main axis drives,\r\n2) Threaded drive pulleys to prevent braid tangles,\r\n3) Use of planetary gear box on extruder,\r\n4) Custom Bowden hot-end holder.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for the braid in place of the drive belts was that I was finding it hard to source GT2 timing belts/pulleys, and braid fishing line was a cheap alternate that a friend suggested I try.  I was a bit skeptical that the braid would work, but so far it has proven to be most effective."
