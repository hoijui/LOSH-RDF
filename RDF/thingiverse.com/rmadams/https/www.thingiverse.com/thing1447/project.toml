function = "This is a device that you can make to light up the inside of your MakerBot.  By using some LEDs, a couple resistors and the MakerBot power supply, you can give your MakerBot that cool glowing interior.  It is designed to snap into the slots on the top of the MakerBot, and be wired to the 12V line of the MakerBot power supply using unused HDD connectors.  It is easy to print up a pair and give it a try!"
