function = "The climate control knobs on Mazda's RX-8 are notoriously delicate. This is a much more robust version of the fan control knob. Use the metal D sleeve from your original knob and push it into the hole into the bottom of the post of this knob.  \n\nUPDATED: Has a window for the dash lights to show through so you can see the setting at night.  \n\nFind the temperature knob here:  \nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:73813"
