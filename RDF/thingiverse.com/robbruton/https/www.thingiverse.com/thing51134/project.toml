function = "This is a guide to keep the extruder head wire bundle from rubbing against the Y axis band when the head is working on the far left of the platform. It will guide the wire bundle up and keep it safe and snag free, and release it when the head moves away. It will not interfere with the extruder head nor any of the workings of the Y axis drive train."
