    okh:function "I don't support the killing of living things, but our office was being seriously overrun by thousands of ants. I had to put some Terro out and cull the invading army. My office-mate joked about readying the tiny ant coffins and before he came in, I printed one of these tiny ABS plastic ant coffins and put it on his desk. I suppose it could be scaled up to carry a larger creature, but I leave that (and the addition of a cover) to you." ;
