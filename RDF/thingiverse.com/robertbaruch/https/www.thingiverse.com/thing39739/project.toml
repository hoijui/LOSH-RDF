function = "This is a carriage pawl for a Monroe models L and LA mechanical calculator. It is part of the zero-setting mechanism for the carriage, where you turn the handle one way to zero out the upper bank of digit dials, and turn the handle the other way for the lower bank. The carriage pawl specifically prevents the opposite bank from turning."
