function: "Admit it. It's happened to you. You've sat down to do your business, only to realize too late that there is no TP in sight.  What to do?  The eternal dilemma - use your hand...or go without?  There really is no right answer.\r\n\r\nBut no more!  The \"Just In Case\" iPhone case (pun intended) means you will never have this problem again.  Carry your own personal roll of TP with you wherever you go...just in case!"
