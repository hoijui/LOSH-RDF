function: "I added longer/ more attachment points since previous version drooped down on the fan side and ruined otherwise fine prints that way.\r\n\r\nI made slots for the nuts so they don't fall and hide under the table when you open up the extruder head to clear a plug or whatever...\r\n\r\nI also added a shovel on one end which is intended to be used to shove small robust prints off the printing surface, so you can print another one...\r\n(this is untested)"
