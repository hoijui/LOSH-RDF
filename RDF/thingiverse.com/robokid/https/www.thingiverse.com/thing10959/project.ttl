    okh:function """Me and my family love asian food,  so of course we use a lot of chopsticks (in fact my Dad eats everything with them, including pizza) and we keep all of our chopsticks in a metal cup.\r
\r
First problem, after sitting on their tips for long periods of time, the paint and wood get worn away leaving bits of chopstick in our food.\r
+How this helps+    since this organizer holds the chopsticks in their center, the tips are left hanging in the air, eliminating wear.\r
\r
Second problem, having tons of chopsticks together in a cup or drawer gets them all mixed up so you have a really hard time organizing them.\r
+How this helps+    Because all of the chopsticks are held next to each other you can organize them into sets of two.  This holder has six holes because I have three people in my family, but this can be lengthened or shortened as desired.""" ;
