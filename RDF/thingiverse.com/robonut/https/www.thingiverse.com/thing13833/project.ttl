    okh:function """Redesign of the outer enclosure for a cheap iPhone4 dock/cradle. Hopefully the cheap Chinese docks are all the same, and someone else can find benefit from this work. Found with the original dock you have to remove your protective phone jacket/case to use it, as the clearances are designed around the phone itself, rather than any 3rd party case or jacket you may be using. Could have easily taken to the original dock with a dremel and a vengeance rather than go to this design effort, but when armed with a 3d printer and a desire to see if good lookin' custom electronics enclosures are within your reach - well, why not!\r
\r
The big win for me with this design was getting the method down for thinking about enclosures split into two (or more) parts to enable good, overhang free, 3d printing. I also used this build to investigate ways of finishing the print so it looks good (and acceptable to my wife - the end user of the dock!). I was really happy with how the thin walls worked out, it's pretty close to an injection molded part.""" ;
