function: "I needed a 3d printed gift for a relative who was keen to learn more about 3d printing, so with him being a guitar muso, I consulted thingiverse. Inspired by CDavis' 3D printed pick holder (thing:1709), I created this one, which is more compact. It has a 3d printed spring which holds the picks inside.\r\n\r\nIt has two parts, the plectrum holder and a heavy duty clip for your guitar strap."
