function = "In our ground floor office we have old aluminum sliding windows whose pane does not seal well enough to prevent the wind from entering through the space inbetween. This 3D printed part solves the cold-wind-penetration issue :)\r\n\r\nThis is to be used on the bottom part of the window, if you are looking for the piece for the upper part of the windows check out thingiverse.com/thing:12942/\r\n\r\nJust measure your Aluminum window pane width and adjust the printed part size to fit snugly."
