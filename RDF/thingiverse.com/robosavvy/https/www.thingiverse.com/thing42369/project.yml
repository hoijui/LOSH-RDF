function: "Sometimes we just need to print a lot of small parts in series. So it would be great if we could print them consecutively. So this is what we came up with.\r\nYou print this sweeper shield that replaces the fan guard and acts as a broom to push parts forward.\r\nThen you add gcode to use the broom to push parts forward and duplicate the code to print multiple parts in series."
