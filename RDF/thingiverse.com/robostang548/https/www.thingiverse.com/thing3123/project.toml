function = "If you have ever used a 3d printer like the Dimension SST, you'll notice how there is little human interaction with the actual machine.  When you set up a print, the machine takes care of running a test extrusion and then cleaning the nozzle before centering itself.  With this in mind, I decided to try and get this working on my cupcake.  Skeinforge already has support for nozzle wipe, I just had to make the bracket.\r\n\r\nSo far I've gotten an initial center, extrude, wipe start file for skeinforge semi-working. I've made one print in which I started my machine cold and just clicked print.  I'll post it just as soon as the v2 firmware starts playing nice with my cupcake."
