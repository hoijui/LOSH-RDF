function = "By a stroke of luck I heard about a makerbot mascot competition to win a Thing-O-Matic the same semester that I took a Solidworks class. Not bad for the first thing I ever modeled, the wrench is sized for 4-40 hex nuts.\r\n\r\nCrafted from the bottom up, I had this idea that the Mascot should have a back story. \"A created creator born to build\" I tried to imagine how I would build him every step of the way. Tinker's name eventually came from what he would do best, tinker with things.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I didn't win, Maybe next time ;) One day I'll print him out, maybe by then Makerbots will have support material!"
