\r
Crafted from the bottom up, I had this idea that the Mascot should have a back story. "A created creator born to build" I tried to imagine how I would build him every step of the way. Tinker's name eventually came from what he would do best, tinker with things.\r
\r
Unfortunately I didn't win, Maybe next time ;) One day I'll print him out, maybe by then Makerbots will have support material!""" ;
