function = "I needed a bit bigger wine rack so I designed this little 10 or 11 bottle wine rack which does the job nicely. I made it out of 3mm MDF, but it would look better in a nicer material.\r\n\r\nI'll put up some better pics once I make a new one under the laser cutter group on www.sharemake.com .\r\n\r\nIf you make one please post a pic and a comment. I would love to see one in Perspex!"
