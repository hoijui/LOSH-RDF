    okh:function """This is a Laser Cut Lamp that I designed. I made the Globe by RickLaser and shined a light through it which looked cool so decided to make something similar but in a lamp form.\r
\r
I designed this just before a lazy Sunday afternoon/night of drinking for a friends birthday and when I got home the design felt like it was burning a hole in my Mac, so I just had to go cut it.  I ended up finishing it at about 2am Monday morning and hence I only have iPhone pics.\r
\r
As I have only taken a few quick pics from my iPhone I will add some better pics on www.sharemake.com under the laser cutting group. \r
\r
Checkout a the full build story at http://www.sharemake.com/groups/laser-cutters/forum/topic/globe-lamp-house-warming-present/\r

I hope you like it.""" ;
