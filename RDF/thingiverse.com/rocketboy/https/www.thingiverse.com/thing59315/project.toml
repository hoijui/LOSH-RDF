function = "Make your own 1/18th scale action figure! (This is the same scale as GI Joe in the 80s).\r\n\r\nWant a lizard with robot arms and legs??  Want his head bigger?  Now's your chance!\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress check back often.  I know the joints are perfect yet but they will be.\r\n\r\nI need your help!\r\n\r\nEarly, static versions of this script used body parts I haved off statues and other models.  This version is different.  I can re-use\r\nheads easily, other body parts, not so much.  For Torsos the center of the neck, arms, & legs need to all be bisect-able by one plane.\r\nFor arms and legs, the uper and lower halves need to be seperate and they need room at the top (not side) for hinges.  The script\r\ngenerates all the connecting pieces, but the parts need to be of the right form to allow the scrip to do it's job.  So if you have a\r\ntorso, or arms or legs I can use let me know!  I'm happy to give format tips, or even take something that's in the right direction and\r\ndo what needs doing to make it work.\r\n\r\nNew joints, and selectable joint types coming soon.\r\n\r\nSelector for 1/18th, 1/12th, 1/10th, 1/8th scale coming soon."
