function = "An OpenSCAD script to create clips with your name on it which can be used to mark your bottles. In contrast to the original version by daniel, this derivative is easier adaptable and knows the following parameters:   \r\n\r\n- name\r\n- logo (DXF, should be 50mm*50mm)\r\n- radius at upper and lower side\r\n- height\r\n- font\r\n- gap angle\r\n\r\nThe name tag itself resides as a module in `bottle-clip.scad`, and there are some ready-to-use examples in `examples.scad`. Feel free to modify them.  \r\n\r\nNote that the STL provided here ist just for illustration. You can print it though, if you want ;-) There are also some logo samples which you can use.  \r\n\r\nUpdate 2018-07-29: add gap angle parameter, useful for flexible filament\r\n\r\nUpdate 2013-03-26: add Club Mate logo. The script needs `Write.scad` and fonts in the `write/` subfolder now.  \r\n\r\nUpdate 2013-06-06: added Tetris S piece and a glider. This thing is now maintained on GitHub: https://github.com/rohieb/bottle-clip-name-tag"
