function = "This project defines the parameters for a set of Forcpes used for PCR sample tube transfer.  The concave surface of the tip holds the sample tube.  The rim of the tube also keeps it from sliding down.  \r\nThe tip is angled (\"canted\") at 3 degrees, to line up when the focep is closed around a tube.\r\nThis project was overseen by Dr. Siderits MD RWJUHH (Clinical Preceptor)."
