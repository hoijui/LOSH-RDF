function: "The is Chaucer, a vertical 3d printer derived from Dave Kennell's pocket printer at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19891#  Like the Pocket Printer, the Chaucer frame is constructed  with 20x20 and 2x60 Misumi extrusions.  \n\nIt is modeled after a vertical milling machine. A light and fast print bed moves on the X-Y axis via stepper motor timing belt drive trains. The print head, or extruder is heavier, and moves on the Z-axis via a lead screw drive train.  \n\nA few sample parts have been uploaded to this Thingiverse site. The \"real\" design files can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/ronsheely/Chaucer  \n\nhttp://RonSheely.com https://IronwoodLabs.com http://dots.IronwoodLabs.com"
