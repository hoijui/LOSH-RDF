function = "I liked the necklace holder, but thought it was a little to angular. I redrew it in Solidworks to change the openings to hearts. I also increased the square hole size to avoid any problems with the fit being too tight.\r\nThe original column mount is unchanged, but it fits 1\" PVC pipe too well to ignore. This barely fits on a Prusa Mendel, so make sure it is well centered."
