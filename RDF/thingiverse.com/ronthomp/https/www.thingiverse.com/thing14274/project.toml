function = "These are rasps (coarse files) for use on your reprap plastic parts.\r\nI found myself using bolts and threaded rod to clean parts, but it was tearing up my hands. So, these are handles for those bolts. I modeled them after screwdriver handles that fit my hand well.\r\nThey could also be used for file handles.\r\nAt first, I printed them laying down, but that made for a lot of raft. Later I printed 4 smaller handles at once standing up, no raft. I printed 4 at a time so they could cool somewhat before the next layer."
