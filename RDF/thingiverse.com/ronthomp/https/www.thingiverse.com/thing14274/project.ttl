I found myself using bolts and threaded rod to clean parts, but it was tearing up my hands. So, these are handles for those bolts. I modeled them after screwdriver handles that fit my hand well.\r
They could also be used for file handles.\r
At first, I printed them laying down, but that made for a lot of raft. Later I printed 4 smaller handles at once standing up, no raft. I printed 4 at a time so they could cool somewhat before the next layer.""" ;
