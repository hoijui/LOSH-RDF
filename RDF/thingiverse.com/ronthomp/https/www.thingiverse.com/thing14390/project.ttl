I printed the first two as individual prints and was amazed how well they fit together. They were on the curved side and used .2 raft. The thin section was hard to clean of support, so I decided to reorient and print all 4 at once. With some minor cleanup, they fit together fine, but not quite as well as the first two.\r
The walls are .1" thick (about 2.5mm) and the laps are half, .05".\r
I put the Solidworks 2011 files in the zip using pack and go.""" ;
