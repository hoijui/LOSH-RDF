function = "I liked the predecessor. I modified the mount and put in more holes to conserve plastic.\r\nThere are 4 mounting holes with nut traps for M3 hardware, but only 3 are used because the Mega doesn't have room for the head of the 4th screw.\r\nThis mounts to the RTM (Ronthomp Mendel) using 6-32 screws and nut traps.\r\nThe part is just as it was removed from the 3D printer, so please excuse the stings in the photos.\r\nIn the photo of it mounted to the frame, the bolt is too long. It will be cut to length."
