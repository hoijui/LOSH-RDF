function = "This is a simplification. I added the Z stop bolt mount to the X end clamp, eliminating a printed part, some hardware and a source of failure. My clip on Z stop is easy to move accidentally.\r\nThe bolt is a 6-32 x 2\" and is tightened against the trapped nut. (4mm works, too.) The Z home is easily and accurately adjusted by moving the thumb nut. One turn of the 6-32 screw is .03125\"\r\nThe thumb nut is self threading when you screw it on, just keep it straight.\r\nThe clamp still uses the M3 nuts in 4 places and either a M8 or 5/16\" nut to match your Z lead screw.\r\nRefer to the old version to see the improvement:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13235"
