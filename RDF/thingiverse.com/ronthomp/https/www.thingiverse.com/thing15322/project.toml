function = "My cheap surround sound system has small speakers that will hang on a screw with a keyhole.\r\nThis is a simple hook to allow a screw mount without damaging the headboard of my bed.\r\nIt's sized for a 6-32 screw to self tap into the plastic. Be careful it doesn't stick out the back and scratch the headboard.\r\nIf I had really been on the ball, I'd have added a groove to hide the wire. Too late, it's already on the printer!\r\n(If your young, it may be a good idea to make it stronger.)"
