This is a simple hook to allow a screw mount without damaging the headboard of my bed.\r
It's sized for a 6-32 screw to self tap into the plastic. Be careful it doesn't stick out the back and scratch the headboard.\r
If I had really been on the ball, I'd have added a groove to hide the wire. Too late, it's already on the printer!\r
(If your young, it may be a good idea to make it stronger.)""" ;
