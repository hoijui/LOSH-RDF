function = "I was a victim of the dreaded \"Leak down chair\".\r\nI flipped it over to get the lay of the land. The cylinder was 1\" diameter, so a quick trip to the band saw with a piece of 1\" I.D. PVC pipe was in order. I sliced a 2\" long piece and then split it. Quick work on the band saw.\r\nAttached with a couple of zip ties. The first was a little too short. I made a 2 1/2\" and a 3\". Installed the 3\" and it seemed just right.\r\nI used 3 zip ties, but didn't cut them, in case I need to snug them up later.\r\nI thought it would need heater hose clamps, but the zip ties are holding OK.\r\nI then drew it up so it can be 3D printed. This part is 1.125\" I.D."
