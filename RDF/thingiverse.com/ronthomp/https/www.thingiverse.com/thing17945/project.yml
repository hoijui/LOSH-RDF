function: "Click the photos for better views.\r\nA new design of an old idea. The Dremel Rotary Tool is held securely in the cradle with clamps and 6-32 screws. The cradle is easily adjustable for depth and held to the base with a single one inch long 1/4-20 carriage bolt, flat washer and wingnut. The two knobs are held on with one and a half inch long 1/4-20 carraige bolts into captive nuts in the base. Some of my hardware was the wrong size, so it looks a little funny in the photos. I added flat washers under the knobs because my bolts were a little long.\r\nI can upload the Solidworks 2011 files if anyone wants them.\r\n3-7-2012...Solidworks 2011 files added in the ZIP file."
