function = "This is to illustrate my thoughts on improving the design for 3D printing. I'm sure there are many ways, this is mine. This is 125mm tall and should print fine on a Prusa using outside only raft. The center hole has a cone top to prevent sagging. If you can't print 125mm tall, you could shorten it.\r\nAn alternative design would be to use a steel rod for the spike and just print the head with some sort of rod mount.\r\nThe rounded edges are called fillets and add strength to the joints."
