function = "A replacement part for a Renault Clio rear door - a plastic mount which the door handhold fixes on to. The offending broken part is also pictured.\r\n\r\nI originally intended to print a mesh within the larger hole for the screw to bite into. However, these thin walls did not come out at all, so I ended up sticking a plasterboard plug in instead! We shall see if this works.\r\n\r\nAny tips on printing thin walls much appreciated."
