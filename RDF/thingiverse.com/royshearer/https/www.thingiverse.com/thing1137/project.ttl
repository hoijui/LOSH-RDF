    okh:function """Niftymitter is an open source short range FM transmitter based on the open source hardware design by Tetsuo Kogawa.\r
\r
Version 0.1 is designed to be housed within a 3mm acrylic or bamboo body, with a variety of options for hacking. The transmitter is tiny and handy for small scale radio broadcasts, building a distributed PA system for performances, linking your personal audio player to your car radio, or for general audio experimentation.\r
\r
I am currently working on v0.21 which is a bit of a radical redesign, so v0.1 is posted for completeness.\r
\r
ISSUES in v0.1:\r
- too bulky\r
- acrylic prone to failure at corners\r
- cable tie construction troublesome - not very secure, ends tend to catch on things.\r
\r
The project's home is at http://www.openthing.org/products/niftymitter""" ;
