function: "Niftymitter is an open source short range FM transmitter based on the open source hardware design by Tetsuo Kogawa.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.22 is designed to be housed within a ~1mm card body, with a variety of options for hacking. The transmitter is tiny and handy for small scale radio broadcasts, building a distributed PA system for performances, linking your personal audio player to your car radio, or for general audio experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe new version solves many of the problems in v0.21 (See project website for v0.21):\r\n    * dimensions of net refined for better fit to battery and pcb, and sleeve.\r\n    * transmission seems to be fine on the whole.\r\n    * spacing and hole sizes fixed for components on PCB\r\n\r\nv0.21 solved many of the issues of v0.1:\r\n    * a lot less bulky, more friendly on the pocket\r\n    * improved component layout, slimmer, more stable\r\n    * no nasty cable ties\r\n    * more accessible for those without laser cutting facilities - can be hand cut, or plotter cut.\r\n    * cardboard more resilient at joints than acrylic.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES IN v0.22:\r\n    * circuit box part needs to be restrained within sleeve - fiddly when removing battery tray.\r\n    * PP3 power lead needs better access to battery tray.\r\n    * separate, powered, mic design required.\r\n\r\nThe project's home is at openthing.org/products/niftymitter"
