function = "Niftymitter is an open source short range FM transmitter based on the open source hardware design by Tetsuo Kogawa.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.24 is designed to be housed within a ~1mm card body (shirt card), with a variety of options for hacking. The transmitter is tiny and handy for small scale radio broadcasts, building a distributed PA system for performances, linking your personal audio player to your car radio, or for general audio experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe new version solves many of the problems in v0.22/0.23:\r\n* Full assembly instructions on instructables.\r\n* Artwork/info added on housing.\r\n* Stereo/mono conflict resolved - can now accommodate stereo and mono plugs.\r\n\r\nKNOWN ISSUES IN v0.24:\r\n* circuit box slides around when switching on/off or plugging in.\r\n* PP3 power lead needs better access to battery tray.\r\n\r\nThe project's home is at openthing.org/products/niftymitter"
