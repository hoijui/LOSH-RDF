function = "Its a cribbage board layout, for engraving into a piece of wood.\r\n\r\nIn the last week in Dundee I managed to get round to doing something that has been plaguing me for about two years: a cribbage board from my friend Suzy. I had already drilled the holes and it took me a while to think up something to laser engrave. I eventually decided on a kind of 'field of shapes' thing given that the board was already punctuated by hundreds of circular holes.\r\n\r\nIt would have been much easier to engrave first, then drill but hey, sometimes things don't happen in the right order! I have put up the .svg for the layout however so that others can do it in the right order.\r\n\r\nThere is significance in the name of this cribbage board, but it might take you a while to realise..\r\n\r\nThe typeface I used is Cooper Black."
