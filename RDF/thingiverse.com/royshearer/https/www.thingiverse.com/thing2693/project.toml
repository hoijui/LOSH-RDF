function = "A little 190ml watering can for watering your houseplant / deskplant.\r\nI haven't yet made or modelled this as I don't have a makerbot. yet.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: On closer inspection, I shortened the length so that it can fit in the makerbot build space. A slightly less pleasing capacity of 190ml (was 200!).\r\n\r\nHave added a couple of feet on the back edge so that it can hopefully be printed sitting on its back, longest side sitting vertically. These should be cut or grinded off once printed. Comments welcomed below."
