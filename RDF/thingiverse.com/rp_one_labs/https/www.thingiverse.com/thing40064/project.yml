function: "Here are set of STL files for Prusa i3 design published by Twelvepro.com\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: With \"improved laser cut frame\", you can really, trully use all of the original Prusa i3 parts designed by Joseph Prusa and posted on github.\r\nYou don't need four parts for Z Axis because they are redundant and implemented with laser cut parts.\r\n\r\nAbout posted files and how their differ from Prusa's design:\r\n\r\n1. All clamping parts designed for GT2 2mm belts only.\r\n\r\n2. X Idler uses M5 Screw to hold two 625ZZ Ball bearings. Original i3 used one M4 mounted bearing and printed idler.\r\n\r\n3. Y Idler also uses M5 Screw to hold two 625ZZ. Original i3 used one M4 mounted bearing and printed idler.\r\n\r\n4. X Motor Part has adustment screw to fine tune level of Z against Z end stop switch.\r\n\r\n5. Y Corners have side cutouts for better wrapping of tie wrap around y shafts.\r\n\r\n6. Y Belt Clamp has 0.9mm of clearance for belt which provides enough clamping and still you can pull belt trough it with pliers.\r\n\r\n7. Y Motor - changes are purely cosmetical.\r\n\r\n8. Y Bushing holders - better grip of LM8UU, also they look better to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly STLs are here. Printer posted by Twelvepro http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39889\r\nHe will repost these files, DXFs as well as BOMs, eventually."
