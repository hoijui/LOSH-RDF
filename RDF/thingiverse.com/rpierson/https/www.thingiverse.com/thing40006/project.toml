Version 2: is a simple one piece print on makerbot rep1, but was not accepted by my daughter due to the handle looking funny.  Version3 is a two part print with the handle very closely matching the original toys shape and size.  Daughter liked this one. \r\nThis is a work in progress and i have been asked to make other tools a shapes for this toy.  so more likely on the way."
