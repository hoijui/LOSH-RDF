function = "I just started using my phone as a GPS so I thought I'd use the same mount for my Garmin with out-of-date maps.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty specific adapter I made for my Garmin Nuvi 200 GPS mount.  The adapter snaps into the same notches that the GPS unit has and allows me to slip in my iPhone 4S with Belkin Vue case.  This will not fit a non-cased 4S, but you could modify my file as needed."
