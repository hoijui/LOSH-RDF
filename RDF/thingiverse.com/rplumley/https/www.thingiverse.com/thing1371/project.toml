function = "Here's my attempt at a Christmas Ornament in the shape of a Makerbot.  This was pretty fun to make, but came out smaller than I thought due to a conversion issue in Rhino.  Good thing I'm not plotting a course to Mars...\r\n\r\nThe large version is just under 3cm wide.  The small one is scaled by 75%.\r\n\r\nThis ornament obeys the three laws of robotics."
