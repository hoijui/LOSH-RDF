function = "I was inspired after watching Wil Wheaton's TableTop on Geek & Sundry to print out a dual extrusion D20.  After searching for a while I figured out that somehow this doesn't exist.  So hopefully this corrects the matter!\r\nLuckily Whosawhatsis's simplified D20 SCAD script was incredibly easy to hack for this purpose.  I was really lazy so there are two scripts to create the individual stl files.  I've also blown up a \"big\" version, but I'd recommend the regular size due to issues with really big prints."
