It was developed by the US consumer product safety commission as part of their procedure here: http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/testtoys.pdf  I've also included a small section that has dimensions of the part to assure you've printed it correctly.\r
  I really wanted to make something my daughter could enjoy right now, but in researching how toys are found to be safe, I came across this part.  While it's probably not expensive to produce, it's still cheaper to make at home I'd imagine.""" ;
