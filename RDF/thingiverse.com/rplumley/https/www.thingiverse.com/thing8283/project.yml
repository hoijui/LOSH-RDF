function: "This is the python version of my MakeNBreak script. (See old perl script here:  http://wiki.makerbot.com/makenbreak)  This program takes a commented skeinforge file and stacks the gcode on top of itself, including a layer floating inbetween to make the parts easy to separate with a razor blade.  \r\n  Many improvements have been done such that you no longer need a file with layer in between.  Simply use a commented skeinforge file.  I've been experimenting with version 36 so hopefully it works with the up-to-date files as well.\r\n  Hopefully this helps folks that are printing lots of parts.  I had good luck using it on a footed vertex. This is great for multiple simple parts.  I've printed a few of the Makerbot Prusa files and always had a failure with that method of stacking STLs.\r\n  Also this is my first thing written in Python so be gentle with comments:)"
