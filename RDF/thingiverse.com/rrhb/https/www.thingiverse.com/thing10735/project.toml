function = "Ben Jackson's Top Guide was an essential addition to my Accessible Wade's Extruder as the filament kept falling off the hobbed bolt when it was tugged to one side.  His Top Guide ensures that no matter what the angle of the incoming filament, it remains vertically centered above the hobbled bolt before it enters the extruder.\r\n\r\nMy (extremely) minor improvement is the addition of a locking clip that holds it in place when screwed in. The original top guide tends to flip along the axis of the bolt a bit as it is only held in place on one side, and if it moves, it defeats the purpose of the item."
