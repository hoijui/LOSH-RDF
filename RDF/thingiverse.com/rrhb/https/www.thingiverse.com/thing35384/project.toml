function = "I use two of these to mount my filament spool to the top of my OpenBeam Rostock.  This makes the printer very solid and portable, I can just grab the whole thing and toss it in my car. It feeds nicely,with a curved filament path right into the extruder.\r\n\r\nThey would be generally useful in any place where you want to mount a rod at an angle to the beam."
