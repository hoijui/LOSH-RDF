function = "So, I wanted to learn OpenSCAD, and what better way than to take MakerBlock's wonderful paramaterized pirate ship and poop all over its code?   \nThis hasn't actually been printed yet, but should theoretically work fine on an ultimaker or other PLA. The top of the bottle will be interesting. This is a WIP, I will be refactoring the code and tweaking the design."
