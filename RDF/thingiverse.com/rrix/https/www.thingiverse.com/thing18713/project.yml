function: "This is a jig to allow you to square your model rocket's fins when you are gluing them. This jig fits a MadCow Arcas HV (2.6\" diameter)  but could be resized fairly easy for other rockets.\r\n\r\nExtra feature: Rail guide. Basically, you want the rail guide to be as straight as humanly possible. This can be done with a lot of measuring, or by turning this jig on its side and (assuming your laser cutter can do straight lines) used as a jig for the rail guides."
