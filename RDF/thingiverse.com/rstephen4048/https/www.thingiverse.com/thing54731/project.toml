function = "Here is an LED flashlite that you can build several ways.   It has a top, body and a cover for the battery(s).  There are two top files â€“ one for a 5mm LED and one for an 8mm LED.  The body has a hole for a sub-mini slide switch and a fitted opening for a 9V battery snap.  The battery cover stays on by friction.  There are 2 cover files â€“ one for a 9V batt and one for 2-AAs.  You will need: a high quality, hard plastic T-type battery snap with wires, a back-to-back 2 AA battery holder, an LED, a resistor, and a sub-miniature slide switch like (Jameson No. 621325)."
