function = "This is a leg pair, derived from Theo Jansen's Strandbeest, that is compatible with LEGO Technic.  I built a set of these to give to my six year-old, who is pretty excited about robots and our 3D printer.  Combined with two LEGO Technic motors, some geartrain parts, and the LEGO IR remote, this becomes a walking robot.  I assembled this as a steerable robot with the drive train in the center, and three leg-pairs on each side.  The LEGO remote can drive two motors, so I set it up with one motor driving each side, so that the bot can be steered like a tank.\r\n\r\nHere's a short video, narrated by my 6 year old: http://youtu.be/0TVsqX-lvMk"
