Made to be put horizontally, with chin up (tilted back, not so stable position, but can be fixed up by enlarging neck base size or rafting some large base). The parts (left and right) of the face are simmetrical producing an well looking piece. There are some fine details (ears, eyes, nose and lips) that demand a very precise profile for printing (see attached files, for an example)." ;
