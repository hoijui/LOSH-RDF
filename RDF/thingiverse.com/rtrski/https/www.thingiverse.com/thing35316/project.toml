function = "*PLEASE DOWNLOAD BOTH PARTS*  This is a simple contoured cover for the wedge-shaped quick-release plates for Gitzo tripod heads.  The QR plates are kind of 'sharp edged' so if you have one mounted at the bottom of your DSLR, yet want to use your left hand to cradle some of the body weight, they hurt...especially at that delicate web between your thumb and forefinger.  This is an attempt at making a more contoured shell that slips over it so you can leave the QR plate on the camera, yet still shoot comfortably.  Print at as low as 0.15 infill and you won't even know it's there, it's weight is so insignificant."
