    okh:function """NOTE (Update 18 Mar 2021): Pictures of made item (Red ABS) are old version, please download at least v6 file for better single/dual spout compatibility!!  "Tampstand Penetrated" file is v6 plus holes for reinforcement - see below.)  \r

Espresso makes me happy.  Tamping a single spout portafilter without a tamp stand makes me sad.  Paying a ludicrous $80 or more for a stainless steel and marble-inlaid, buffed-with-virginal-baby-diaper-soft-cotton tampstand with some bozo logo on it makes me angry.  Me without espresso with a rich thick crema from the perfect grind and tamp, angry, makes the world a scary place.  I need to not be angry.  \r
\r
Hence, the swooshy blended just-strong-enough it flexes a little to let me know when I'm tamping just right, ABS tampstand.  In red, because Rockets have red glare. :)  \r

5/11/2014: Updated with a v6 file with less faceting.  My original finally got overstressed and cracked, so rather than just reprint I did some redesign.  The new version fits both the single and dual spout portafilters and provides a bit more strength.  Since I needed an 'undercut' for the dual spout, the new file has integral support parts that are part of the print.  I prefer to design these in rather than let my slicer provide them since I can better control contact points and removability without excessively marring the desired finished part.\r

03/18/2021: Well, after many years of use again, I broke my print mid tamp.  Makes for a bitter cup.  ;-)  So finally did something I've been meaning to for some time, even though I no longer have the original Creo file made my stl from, so only had the mesh to work with.  I was able to import the v6 file with integrated supports and Meshmix it to add a couple of 3.2mm holes thru the main body height.  These might help with reinforcement on their own, but they're about right for 8d 2.5inch bright finish nails: coat them good with E6000 or drip some good liquid superglue into the holes (tape the bottoms!) then tap the tight heads down gently with a hammer, clean up any surface smears, and hopefully the nails will help prevent breakage in the future.  (You could also use 0.125in dia rod stock if you can find it, or just trim lengths of 2.85mm filament and probably thread them in, not sure about glue technique in that case (insert all the way thru dry with plenty of excess, apply glue to protruding section and pull thru from other side, then trim both faces after?).  Anyway, happy to see one of my early naive attempts at designing something useful has actually had several makes and many likes and collects over the years.  Happy caffeination!""" ;
