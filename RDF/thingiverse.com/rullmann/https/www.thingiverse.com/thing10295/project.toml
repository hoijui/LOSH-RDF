function = "A friend of mine wanted something to plug the headphone port on his iphone since it gets used in a very dirty environment and he doesn't use the headhpone port that often.  So I modeled up this dummy plug which I modeled off of a 3.5mm TRS(3 pin) Male ipod headphone connector.\r\n\r\nI tested this in my iphone, ipod, and computer headphone jacks and it worked in all of them.\r\n\r\nDue to their small size it would be a good idea to print multiples of these at one time to give each a chance to cool more before the next layer is added.  I was able to print these without using a raft and used the multiple function in skeinforge to print 6-8 out at a time."
