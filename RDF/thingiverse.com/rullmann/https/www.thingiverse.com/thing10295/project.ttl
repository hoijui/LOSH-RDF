    okh:function """A friend of mine wanted something to plug the headphone port on his iphone since it gets used in a very dirty environment and he doesn't use the headhpone port that often.  So I modeled up this dummy plug which I modeled off of a 3.5mm TRS(3 pin) Male ipod headphone connector.\r
\r
I tested this in my iphone, ipod, and computer headphone jacks and it worked in all of them.\r
\r
Due to their small size it would be a good idea to print multiples of these at one time to give each a chance to cool more before the next layer is added.  I was able to print these without using a raft and used the multiple function in skeinforge to print 6-8 out at a time.""" ;
