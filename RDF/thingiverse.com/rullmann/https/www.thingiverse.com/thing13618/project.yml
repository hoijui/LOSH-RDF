function: "This is a spool case for earbud headphones\r\nInsert the earbuds in the spool, rotate the spool with your thumb to wind up the wire and then snap the cover shut.\r\n\r\nThere will likely be updates to this so it is listed as work in progress since ive yet to print out the latest adjustments to the hinge and snap close features.\r\n\r\n12-26-2011: Increased Headphone Hole size in spool to accomodate a different pair of headphones. Decreased Slot size in outercase.\r\n\r\n\r\n11-15-2011: Updated Outercase parts to increase hinge hole size and surrounding material slightly.  Modified Snap feature on top of case to increase width and depth of snap tab(tab broke off rather quickly on last revision, hopefully this will help.)"
