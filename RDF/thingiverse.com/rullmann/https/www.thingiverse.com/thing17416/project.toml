function = "This allows you to bolt a Makerbot Filament spool holder(thingiverse.com/thing:7105) to the top of the Mendel Z-Rod's.\r\n\r\n3/4/2012 - I've experienced some issues with my x-axis missing steps off and on with the spool mounted in the first orientation.  Therefore, I designed some additional brackets to re-orient the spool to allow the filament to feed better.  I broke up the bracket into two pieces so it can be printed on a TOM."
