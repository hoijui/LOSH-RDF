function = "These brackets allow you to mount a 40mm fan to a Mendel.\r\n\r\nMy x,y, and extruder stepper motors were getting quite warm especially during long prints.  I turned down the current limit on the pololus after realizing that the Makerbot motors I installed were .4 amp motors and not .84 like the ones currently on their site.  Even after adjusting the current limit on the stepper drivers they get warmer than I care for so I designed these brackets to mount some 40mm fans I found at radioshack.  While the motors would probably be fine these gave me something to print and install and also allow me to keep the current setting set a little higher than the stepper rating and still run them cool.\r\n\r\nThese brackets are designed around a Sells Mendel with a Wades Extruder\r\n\r\nI took some pictures using my iphone of the mounts installed.  Despite rotating the pictures in windows and re-saving them they still appear rotated in thingiverse...not the first pictures i've had this issue with posting on thingiverse...any ideas?"
