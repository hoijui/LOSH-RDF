function: "Here's a sneak peek of a clock prototype i've been throwing together. Its not complete yet as there are no hands for the hours/minutes seconds and the minute gear currently spins backwards.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this prototype was to verify that is it possible to print the full geartrain from escapement to hours gear and have the gears spin when a reasonable amount of force is applied.\r\n\r\nI haven't printed the pendulum, but roughly 1.5lbs of weight applied to the drum on the hours gear will spin the entire geartrain and appears to be reasonably tolerant of alignment and tilting. (until the string hits one of the gears)\r\n\r\nThere are front pieces, so sadly the gears are hidden from view while operating, but I'm hopeful to have a it ticking with a ~1 meter pendulum within another day or so.\r\n\r\nThe screws are all M3 and most are stainless steel 55mm long.\r\n\r\nTo get a sense of scale, the backing squares are 100mm x 100mm."
