function = "I made an external filament guide to add to the top of a Greg's or other extruder for better guiding of the filament. I found that mine usually misses the guidler one and so I added this to the other side on top of the extruder housing. I like my Guidler to be back a little so the bolts will not pop off, so I needed this for a little extra help."
