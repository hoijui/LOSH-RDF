function: "This is my take on the worlds oldest continuously played board game Go.  Dating back over 2000 years.  \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_game\r\n\r\nThis started out as a way to make a Go board that could be played in a moving vehicle, but it quickly morphed into what you see today.  This modular set of Go board pieces can be used to create any  n*n size Go board you want as well as arbitrary shapes.  If really adds a new dimension to playing Go when you have obstacles or other shapes.  \r\n\r\nEach piece contains a 5 mm magnetic ball and is free to rotate inside the piece to create a perfect alignment with the center of the grid.  I would imagine this board would be useful for people that lack the fine motor skills to accuracy place pieces on a standard Go board.\r\n\r\nVideo demonstration of board and pieces\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZMIMVO_rrA"
