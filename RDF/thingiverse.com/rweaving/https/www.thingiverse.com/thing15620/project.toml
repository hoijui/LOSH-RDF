function = "This is a tubular drive mechanism.  It is designed to use 1/2 inch aluminum conduit.  This is a work in process, and I am already working on a newer version that will use dual rails.  I think that this type of mechanism will work well as an linear axis drive mechanism when combined a stepper motor, and magnetic linear encoder would provide high accuracy large scale positioning. \r\n\r\nTubular Drive Test Fixed Drive\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0G8B77UOJs\r\n\r\nTubular Drive Test Fixed Conduit\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70dTRN7zSpU"
