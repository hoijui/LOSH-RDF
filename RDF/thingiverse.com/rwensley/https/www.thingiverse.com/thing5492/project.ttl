\r
Some of the new owners of ToMs have been experiencing problems with the extruder motor failing after a short time.  I was able to see that the problem is related to glitches on the extruder controller board possibly due to the power supply.  \r
\r
As a work around until MBI develops a proper fix, I have added this relay board to the output of the EC board.  As a result I have been able to print several objects with out issue.""" ;
