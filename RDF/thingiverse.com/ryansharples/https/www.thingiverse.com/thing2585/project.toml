function = "A robot hand designed for low-cost production.  Once assembled, fishing line is used to power the fingers and wrist.  The fingers are designed to lock straight, and each joint locks at 90 degrees.\r\n\r\nFor those with a larger print-bed, this file contains one of everything you need to create your robot hand.  For the extra digits, or if you have a smaller bed, I have loaded individual files for printing.  Please note that some of these designs layouts will need a filler material.\r\n\r\nwww.makezine.com/go/makerbot\r\n\r\nI would love to see your finished products!"
