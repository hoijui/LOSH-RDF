    okh:function """A robot hand designed for low-cost production.  Once assembled, fishing line is used to power the fingers and wrist.  The fingers are designed to lock straight, and each joint locks at 90 degrees.\r
\r
For those with a larger print-bed, this file contains one of everything you need to create your robot hand.  For the extra digits, or if you have a smaller bed, I have loaded individual files for printing.  Please note that some of these designs layouts will need a filler material.\r
