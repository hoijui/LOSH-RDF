function = "This is a snap-in add-on hook for a certain swedish closet system.  \nVersion E2 removes a lot of geometric problems, changes the hook to a rounded rod, and includes hand-made support structures (turn of support when printing). Also a slight tweak to the hook to make it easier to install/remove.  \nThe supports still need some work, but make clean-up much easier than scraping away all the skeinforge supports.  \n\nHigher Letter/Number combos are newer versions.  \n\nRev G has improved hook and support material an numerous other enhancements."
