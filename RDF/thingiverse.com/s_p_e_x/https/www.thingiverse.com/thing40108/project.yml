function: "I tweaked a Makerbot Replicator octave-sytle spool-holder that worked well for me for months, but had a single point of failure (the nub which kept the spool on the spindle was very small and eventually broke off).\r\n\r\nImporting STL into Sketchup (via meshlab) made for an interesting result. But it works."
