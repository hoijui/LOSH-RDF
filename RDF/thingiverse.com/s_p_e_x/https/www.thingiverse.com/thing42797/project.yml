function: "The metal cube-wall hooks for hanging whiteboards can be very cheap and in some cases not even strong enough to hold up the larger whiteboards.\r\n\r\nIt is v2 because I had to reinforce and adjust the design after the first version slipped off the cube wall and sprang across the room.\r\nSo I made a sturdier hook which works pretty well for the whiteboards with a metal frame."
