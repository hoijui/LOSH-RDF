I sorta started from scratch and used it as a reason to learn a bit about ruby. (Yikes! And remember my vector math from school!)  



Thank goodness Meshlab supports ASCII STL files. Otherwise this was going to get very messy as Ruby doesn't so much do writing binary files.  



I had a really good idea to link the "kochness" level to the diameter, so that very elaborate functions for the diameter would be possible and even pleasing.  



Stay tuned...""" ;
