\r
So I took the guts out of a sparkfun 9V DC converter and stretched the base to fit.\r
\r
I added some structures to the bottom help with shrinkage/warping. I don't know really if they did or not.\r
\r
I added a switch from RadioShack to the base as well so that you can turn of the A/C power.""" ;
