function: "I wanted to make a working lamp out of that nice model, but I didn't want the AC->DC transformer sucking watts even when it was off.\r\n\r\nSo I took the guts out of a sparkfun 9V DC converter and stretched the base to fit.\r\n\r\nI added some structures to the bottom help with shrinkage/warping. I don't know really if they did or not.\r\n\r\nI added a switch from RadioShack to the base as well so that you can turn of the A/C power."
