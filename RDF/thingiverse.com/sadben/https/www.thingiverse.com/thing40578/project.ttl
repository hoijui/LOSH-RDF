    okh:function "This is a space craft that is design for long periods of time in space. The crew area is the toroidal shape infront of the solar panels. This is designed to spin to create artificial gravity. The ship is powered by nuclear powered Plasma rockets at the back. The design was created to provide as much thrust and power as possible for a crew of 20 for a trip to the moon or mars. The design was also created based on research NASA is conducting and theoretical designs that have piled up over the years. Since NASA is planning another rover for mars in 2020, it can be estimated that there will be a manned mission around 2040" ;
