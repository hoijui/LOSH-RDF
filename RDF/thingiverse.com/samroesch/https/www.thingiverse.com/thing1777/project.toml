function = "This is a replacement part for ubiquitous MDR-V150 headphones. It is the most commonly broken part. I have not tried printing it yet, so if anyone does, tell me how it goes.   \n\n\n\nEDIT1: I have uploaded version 2.0, which is soon to be printed on a dimension 3D printer.   \n\nEDIT 2: As some have pointed out, this model sucked pretty bad. Check out the remix by Mflego: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:755250  \n\nI should also mention that I got a print done by shapeways with this model: http://shpws.me/CfOW. It was fairly successful, and only required a bit of drilling/sanding to get it to fit. The headphones are still rocking!"
