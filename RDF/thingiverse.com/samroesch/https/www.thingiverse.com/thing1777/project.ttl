EDIT1: I have uploaded version 2.0, which is soon to be printed on a dimension 3D printer.   

EDIT 2: As some have pointed out, this model sucked pretty bad. Check out the remix by Mflego: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:755250  

I should also mention that I got a print done by shapeways with this model: http://shpws.me/CfOW. It was fairly successful, and only required a bit of drilling/sanding to get it to fit. The headphones are still rocking!""" ;
