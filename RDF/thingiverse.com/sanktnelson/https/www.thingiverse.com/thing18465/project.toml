function = "This mimicks a little tool I once saw in a camping shop and which they wanted 10EUR for. I was too cheap to pay that much, so I bought a 3D printer instead and made one. Stick it on the propane hose going to the bottle and you always have a tool to tighten that one nut handy. Parameterizable for any size."
