function = "This is a larger diameter wheel for the popular \"AXA HR Traction power control\" bike dynamo.  \r\nIt makes it possible to run it on the rim where it is much quieter and more efficient. the larger diameter also means reduced losses at higher speed (but less light at lower speed - should be fine with modern LED lights though)"
