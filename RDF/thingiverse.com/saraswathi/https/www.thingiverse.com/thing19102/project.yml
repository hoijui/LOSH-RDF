function: "http://ibreathe.info/\r\n\r\niBreathe runs off of a stretch sensor, an arduino, and Processing.\r\n\r\nOftentimes when we sit at our computers, hunched over, distracted, or stressed out - we forget to breathe. Linda Stone refers to this common phenomenon as \"email apnea\" in this article: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-stone/just-breathe-building-the_b_85651.html\r\n\r\nShallow, restricted breathing and poor posture can lead to short term feelings of anxiety, and long term health problems! This is where iBreathe comes in.\r\n\r\nUsing Processing code, iBreathe helps you calibrate a moderate to deep breath through the dimness function in your (mac only, for now) computer. When your breathing falls out of the calibrated range - i.e. stops or becomes shallow - your computer screen will dim, obscuring your work. Once you are back in range, your computer will brighten again, and you can keep at it - hopefully feeling a bit more serene.\r\n\r\nAlso included here is a bracelet that uses an iPhone motor to vibrate as a gentle, tactile reward when you are breathing in range for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nAnd last of all - just for fun - is the USB umbilical cord. iBreathe can run wired or wirelessly, but at the ITP Winter Show, where it was shown recently, we kept it wired via a latex covered USB cord made to look like flesh - just to emphasize the biological link you're forging with your computer by being mindful of your breath.\r\n\r\nHave fun! And please email us with your questions, comments, or success! \r\n\r\nhi.ibreathe @ gmail . com"
