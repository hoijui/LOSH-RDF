function = "Fancy yourself a masochist? Or perhaps you are a sadist? Either way you'll love the pain and deprivation provided by the all new iTorture. Take yours or a friends iPhone 4 and drop it into the tightly constrained iHole at the top of the iTorture and let the iMissery begin. Once inside the iTorture's magical Spheroid inner cavity you're really going to be taking advantage of this never before seen special regular hexahedron. Boom.\r\n\r\nOh and one more thing. The iTorture has a special viewing port on its bottom face, just big enough to give you the illusion of control while trying to coax the iPhone from its truncated cube prison. Want to up the stakes. Try the iTorture Extreme for an even more challenging experience."
