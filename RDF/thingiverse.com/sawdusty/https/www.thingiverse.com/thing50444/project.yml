function: "Inkscape font -> DXF file -> OpenSCAD with Write.scad\r\n\r\nI really like the Write extension for OpenSCAD http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16193, but as soon as I used it I wanted different fonts.\r\n\r\nI work with Inkscape a lot and I like the text fonts it has built in. This Inkscape extension is a python script to begin the process of creating a font face (a DXF file) for OpenSCAD and the Write extension. Some manual work is necessary in Inkscape to finish the process, but it's worth it."
