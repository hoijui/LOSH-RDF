Existing products on the market are either very expensive or still require quite fine dexterity to use.\r\n\r\nWe designed and built these using mainly a laser cutter and acrylic sheet stock, with some use of a lathe to turn a flexible plastic part.\r\n\r\nCreated as part of the Hackshack project for Full Circle Arts, Manchester.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fullcirclearts.co.uk/projects/hackshack-all-about-the-process/\r\n\r\nMaterials list:\r\n\r\n5mm acrylic sheet\r\n\r\n3mm acrylic sheet\r\n\r\nDelrin or Nylon plastic bar stock\r\n\r\nM5 + M3 hardware, see design files for full listing"
