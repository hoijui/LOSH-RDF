function: "**\r\nEDIT: these files have now been removed. look on github instead.\r\n\r\nUntil things have been cleared up re: licensing, selling and generally being cool with the OS community again.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nBrief: to create an open design that allows people with varying levels of arthritis to use aerosol cans. Existing products on the market are either very expensive or still require quite fine dexterity to use.\r\n\r\nWe designed and built these using mainly a laser cutter and acrylic sheet stock, with some use of a lathe to turn a flexible plastic part.\r\n\r\nCreated as part of the Hackshack project for Full Circle Arts, Manchester.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fullcirclearts.co.uk/projects/hackshack-all-about-the-process/\r\n\r\nMaterials list:\r\n\r\n5mm acrylic sheet\r\n\r\n3mm acrylic sheet\r\n\r\nDelrin or Nylon plastic bar stock\r\n\r\nM5 + M3 hardware, see design files for full listing"
