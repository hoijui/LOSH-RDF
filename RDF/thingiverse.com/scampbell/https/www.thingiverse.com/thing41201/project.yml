function: "This mask was designed in Illustrator, printed flat, and then molded with a heat gun to fit the contours of a face.  \n\nI have included the original Illustrator file which I imported into Rhinoceros and then extruded about 2mm and then saved as an STL file. I think there are other 3D programs that will allow you to extrude AI files, possibly even Google Sketchup although I have not tried it yet."
