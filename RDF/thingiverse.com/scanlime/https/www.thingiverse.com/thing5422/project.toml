function = "This is a really simple design, but I hadn't seen this done before, so I thought I'd upload mine.\r\n\r\nIt's a small plastic divider insert that you can put into a miniature mint tin in order to turn it into a multi-day pill box. The OpenSCAD model is parametric, but the settings I have by default give you 6 compartments in an \"Altoids Smalls\" mint tin.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1/22/2011: Added new files, a Version 2 (tighter fitting, notched) insert for Altoids Smalls tins and a new larger 15-compartment insert for full-size Altoids tins."
