function: "I have a (now discontinued) Griffin Technology TuneFlex Aux. This was a nice mount for iphones and ipods in that it came with a bunch of attachable adapters that would make your iphone, ipod, whanot, fit.\r\n\r\nHowever, they had no such mount for an iphone4 (and indeed this device is no longer available from griffin.)\r\n\r\nInstead of buying the latest and greatest they had I decided to just design and print an adapter that would fit and that would hold my iphone 4 nicel."
