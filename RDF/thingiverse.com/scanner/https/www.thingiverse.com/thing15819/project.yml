function: "I got an io gear kvm and needed a good way to mount it to the underside of a shelf.\r\n\r\nLuckily with the makerbot thing-o-matic I could custom print parts specifically to hold it instead of having to scrap together duct tape or odd sized pieces of metal and wood to hold it in place.\r\n\r\nThis is probably not going to be very useful to anyone as is but maybe someone will use it to design their own brackets.\r\n\r\nMostly put it here because sharing is caring!"
