\r
However after one battery they start to become hard to control in your pockets, purses, book bags, etc.\r
\r
So this is parametric in that you can say how many batteries you want it to hold and the size and shape of each battery.\r
\r
Tolerances are pretty tight so some fiddling may be in order.""" ;
