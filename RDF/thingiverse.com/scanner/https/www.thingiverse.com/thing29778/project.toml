function = "SparkFun has a simple audio amplifier kit, the STA540 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9612). Since I plan on building several of these (adding increasing automation to them) I wanted an enclosure for these.\r\n\r\nAs they were 'out of sight out of mind' type devices mounted under my desk and such places I needed mounting tabs for them too.\r\n\r\nThis design is not complete because I need to add a cover to it, but what we have here works and fits the kit as currently (as of August, 2012) supplied by SparkFun."
