function: "Plastic insert for the ElevationLabs Elevation Dock to use an Apple Lightning cable instead of the 30 pin dock adapter it comes with.\r\n\r\nThis is orginally based on the thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31429 but the calibration between whatever was made to print that and my replicator is off. The lighting cable would not even fit in to the rectangular hole they used."
