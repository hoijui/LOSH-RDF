function = "I have an ancient TuneFlex from Griffin Technology (they have not sold these for a long time) and this went in our pack of tech that we take when we travel somewhere we are renting a car, thus letting us power our iPhone for navigation and tunes. With the iPhone 5 though I had to make an adapter. It is (on my replicator at least) perfectly sized to fit the Apple 30 pin to lightning adapter."
