function: "Dorba is in a hurry - Don't forget your kits! This thing was made with Tinkercad. For more information on the rare and elusive Dorba Bear, go here: schlem.deviantart.com/ Check out my shop on Shapeways to get a 3D Print of this object: shapeways.com/shops/bitforge\r\n\r\nThis is the preferred running Dorba, owing to interior void space.  The version without the Pelican cases will not print (at least in ceramic, and possibly others)"
