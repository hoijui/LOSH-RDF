This is the result of my intuitive understanding of how whistles are put together.  There are a number of parameters that may or may not make this work.  So, while I wait for my Printrbot to arrive, I am hoping someone with either print this or a derivative and let me know how it works.  \r
\r
The things that I think affect a whistle's ability to make a sound:\r
-size of aperture \r
-angle of air flow (currently tangent to aperture)\r
-angle of edge that "cuts" airflow from mouthpiece\r
-volume of whistle (pitch)""" ;
