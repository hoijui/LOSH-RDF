function: "This thing was made with Tinkercad. \r\n\r\nThis is the result of my intuitive understanding of how whistles are put together.  There are a number of parameters that may or may not make this work.  So, while I wait for my Printrbot to arrive, I am hoping someone with either print this or a derivative and let me know how it works.  \r\n\r\nThe things that I think affect a whistle's ability to make a sound:\r\n-size of aperture \r\n-angle of air flow (currently tangent to aperture)\r\n-angle of edge that \"cuts\" airflow from mouthpiece\r\n-volume of whistle (pitch)"
