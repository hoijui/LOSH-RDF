function: "This thing was made with Tinkercad. \r\n\r\n(Where the hell's the picture?)\r\nWe use these to protect the threads of SCBA (firefighting air packs) bottles during storage and transport.  They are a cheap little plastic cap that costs nothing.  Would be fun to put someone's head or a skull on the cap.  The plain white tapered cylinder is the internal dimensions of a Scott SCBA bottle cap - use it as a \"hole\" to make anything into an SCBA bottle cap. Different manufacturers may have different dimensions."
