function: So, as you can see in the photo, I over-tightened the Z-drive clamps on my Printrbot build. The birch ply is not up to the power of a ham-fisted schlem and eventually cracked through. I looked for an off-the-shelf solution, but I couldn't find two appropriately-sized plates to make the repair.   So, first thing I am printing (after minor tweaking prints) is a set of clamps to replace the busted plywood.  I am printing it as I type this (without support) and I think it is going to work very well.  This is for a Printrbot Plus, but I expect it will work any of the PBs.  The groove in the middle that sandwiches the Z drive screw and the shimmed motor shaft is 8mm diam.  If you are adapting this for a different 3D printer/application - you may need to modify that.
