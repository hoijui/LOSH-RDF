function = "EDIT: After using this to clean my mighty hobbed bolts, I worry that small bits of brass wire might find their way into the extruder. I have resorted to using a toothbrush for Hob Nobbing.  You have been warned.  \n---  \n I found that the perfect tool for cleaning the mighty hobbed bolt is a a brass bore brush used for cleaning firearms.  Just set the extruder to extrude nothing for 50mm and spin the brush in the cuts on the bolt. One problem is that it is too short to comfortably hold while you mung out the fine teeth of the Hob. Hobbing?  This handy little adapter allows you to screw it into a 1/4\" hex that will plug into your favorite screwdrivey handle thingamajig. The width of this little gizmacci is LESS than 1/4\" across the flats- yet it is still too big to fit into my screwdrivey handle thingamajig without sanding/filing.  Feel free to experiment.  I won't be offended. Share. Oh, I discovered that the tension on the hobbed bolt needs to be vastly less than what I initially thought.  If you're chewing up your fillyment, back it off a bit. AND clean out the pixie dust from the teeth."
