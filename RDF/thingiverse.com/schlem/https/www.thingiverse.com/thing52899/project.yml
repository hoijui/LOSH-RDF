function: "My partner on the Medic Unit is an avid golfer, and when I told him about 3D Printing, his first thought was being freed from the tyranny of buying golf tees.  I made a couple sizes, but I think this one is the best length (I submit that I know less than nothing about Golf). They are being tested at this very moment.  Thanks to ssd for the rendering of the Golf ball \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6025\r\nthat I perched on the Yu-T Tee."
