function = "Not long after assembling my 3D Printer (the Schlabricator ), my wife, Beehive, AKA She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, banished my beloved, but slightly odorous, machine to the garage. Originally built for Model-T era vehicles, the garage is behind the house and unusable for its intended function, owing to a gnarled Russian Olive that obstructs the driveway.  There is power to the building, but no heat, and therein lies the motivation for building an enclosure for my Printrbot plus.  When the weather is coolish - in the 40's - it takes an inordinate amount of time for the heated bed to actually heat up. I have experimented with insulating the glass with a blanket of paper sheets, but it still takes far too long, and the temperature ceases to be maintained when the \"blanket\" is removed. The enclosure will also help keep the printer clean in the dusty chaos of my projects."
