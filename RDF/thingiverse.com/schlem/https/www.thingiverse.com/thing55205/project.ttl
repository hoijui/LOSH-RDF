\r
This is an adjustable vent that sit atop the plexiglass enclosure to passively vent hot air and fumes through convection. This is designed to fit in 2 inch hole.  I had very good success with a new hole saw at slow speed. \r
\r
The pin the vent spins around is a section of 3.0 mm ABS filament that has the ends "peened" with a hot element, like a soldering iron.  You can clean out the small hole with a 1/8" drill bit which is just a tiny bit bigger than 3.0mm.\r
\r
You will need some nasty-ass chemistry to bond ABS and Acrylic - I used Devcon Home Plastic Welder, but other comparable products exist.""" ;
