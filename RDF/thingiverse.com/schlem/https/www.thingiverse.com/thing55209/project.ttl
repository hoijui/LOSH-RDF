\r
These are hinges for the door to the enclosure.  The pin the hinge hangs from is a section of 3.0 mm ABS filament that has the end "peened" with a hot element, like a soldering iron. You can clean out the hinge holes with a 1/8" drill bit which is just a tiny bit bigger than 3.0mm.\r
\r
\r
These are designed for 1/8 inch-thick plexi sheets.  There are two outside hinge elements that sandwich the middle hinge on the door.  Mate the bottom element and the middle element such that their smooth (bottom) sides kiss.  Your hinginess will be much smoother. The design of the faces that engage the plexi should suggest the area of glue application.\r
\r
Speaking of...\r
You will need some nasty-ass chemistry to bond ABS and Acrylic - I used Devcon Home Plastic Welder, but other comparable products exist.""" ;
