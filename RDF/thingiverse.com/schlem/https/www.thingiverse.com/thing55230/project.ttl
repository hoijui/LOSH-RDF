\r
This "tray" contains a swiveling pass-through filament guide and reinforcing rings for wiring/vent holes.  All these parts are designed for a 1 inch hole.  I had very good results with a new 1" hole saw at slow speed. \r
\r
An annoying property of acrylic sheet is how edge defects from cutting or drilling can spawn heart-breaking cracks (ask me how I know this)  I think reinforcing any hole through plexi is cheap insurance.  The Pass-through will fit 1/4 inch sheet or 1/8 inch sheet (like I used) with a ring as a shim.  The photos should demonstrate how the Swivel Pass-through works.  Be careful not to accidentally glue your swivel ball in the rings - it should move freely and be loose.  \r
\r
You will need some nasty-ass chemistry to bond ABS and Acrylic - I used Devcon Home Plastic Welder, but other comparable products exist.""" ;
