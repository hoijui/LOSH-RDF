function = "Another robot wheel on Thingiverse.  This was designed to fit a Lego axle connector, but the hole printed too small.  I drilled it out slightly larger than 7mm and shimmed the connector with electrical tape.  Suboptimal.  I should have at least used some gap-filling epoxy.  \r\n\r\nFYI This is a rover-style robot controlled by a Basic Stamp, with a simple two servo/ caster drivetrain.  If Micheal ever finishes it ( and he may not - that's half the fun), I'll post pix."
