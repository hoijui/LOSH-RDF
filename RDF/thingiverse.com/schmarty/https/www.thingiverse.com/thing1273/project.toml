function = "Clips for a refrigerator shelf restraint.\r\n\r\nI recently moved into a new apartment with a missing bottom shelf restraint. Thanks to MakerBot and OpenSCAD, I can finally replace it!\r\n\r\nThe hole on the left side is a bit more damaged than the right, so I created 2 different clips.\r\n\r\nOne fun exercise when creating this thing was modeling an M5 nut in order to remove it from the model later. I recommend everyone try it. :)"
