function = "Get out your best green filament and get festive!  \n\n\n\nThese 8-bit glasses print all in one piece - arms and all!  The corners of the frames are tacked down with \"mouse ears\" in the shape of shamrocks, so you're all set for your St. Patrick's Day celebrations!  \n\n\n\nThe default size should fit most people, but feel free to scale the design, or play with it in OpenSCAD and make your own stylish variation!  \n\n\n\nThese glasses are inspired by the \"5DPI\" glasses design by Dzmitry Samal: http://www.dzmitrysamal.com/5dpi.html"
