function = "A little bow to string your dental floss across.  Requires less floss than using your fingers, and only slightly harder to use!\r\n\r\nStandard warnings apply:\r\n * Don't accidentally swallow this thing.\r\n * Don't use this if you're uncomfortable having plastic in your mouth.\r\n\r\nAnd problems with this design:\r\n * The bow is not quite thick enough to prevent it from bending inward.\r\n * The straight-line handle makes it hard to reach back teeth."
