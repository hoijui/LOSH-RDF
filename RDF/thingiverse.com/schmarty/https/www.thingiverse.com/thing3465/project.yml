function: "It's a story that can happen to anyone.  You move to a new town and leave your shower curtain behind.  \"No problem,\" you think, \"I'll just pick up a new liner at the pharmacy down the street.\"\r\n\r\nSo, you trek to the local pharmacy and find the shower curtain liner you were looking for, only to discover that they are out of shower curtain rings, hooks, anything made for holding up a shower curtain!\r\n\r\nFacing down defeat and the very real possibility that you will have to take a dirty, inefficient bath, you come to a stunning realization:\r\n\r\nYou're a MakerBot owner.  You live for these moments."
