Why not?\r\n\r\nStarting with the CameraHolder.stl from abarry's MakerScanner 0.3 (thing:3946), I wrote a goofy little OpenSCAD script to chop off some of the scanner-specific parts, thicken the base, and cut out space for a standard tripod 1/4\"-20 hex nut and bolt.\r\n\r\nLicense is GPL based on abarry's MakerScanner license and use of Catarina Mota's shapes.scad (http://www.thingiverse.com/download:11183)."
