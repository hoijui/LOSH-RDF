It makes use of mifga's tricks for pen registration and page-changing.\r\n\r\nThere are configuration options at the top of the file, so tweak them to make things work best for your bot and your needs.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress. Fork it and make improvements on GitHub! https://gist.github.com/771967\r\n\r\nIdeas for improvements:\r\n* Fills and/or cross-hatching\r\n* Deploy this as a web service\r\n* Clean up the code :)"
