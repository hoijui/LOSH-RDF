function = "I felt that it was about time Baltimore Node had a Unicorn-plottable logo! You can learn more about this awesome hackerspace at baltimorenode.org.\r\n\r\nI've attached all the files I used to create the G-Code for this thing, which tells the story of how you can make your own:\r\n\r\n* node_logo.svg - Start with the SVG logo available from the Node wiki.\r\n* node_logo.eps - Use Inkscape to export an EPS file, making sure to convert text to paths.\r\n* node_logo.dxf - Use pstoedit as described on Tony's 2D-to-3D post - tonybuser.com/2d-to-3d - to create a DXF, with simple line approximations of curves. I also ended up using some scaling:\r\n\r\n  pstoedit -xscale 18 -yscale 18 -dt -f dxf:-polyaslines node_logo.eps node_logo.dxf\r\n\r\n* node_logo.gcode - Use scribbles.py from GitHub to convert the DXF into Unicorn G-Code. github.com/makerbot/Makerbot\r\n\r\nI used Pleasant3D for its excellent G-Code preview capabilities to check that everything looked reasonable, find a good scaling, etc."
