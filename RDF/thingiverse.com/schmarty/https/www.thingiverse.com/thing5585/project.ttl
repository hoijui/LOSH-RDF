\r
I've attached all the files I used to create the G-Code for this thing, which tells the story of how you can make your own:\r
\r
* node_logo.svg - Start with the SVG logo available from the Node wiki.\r
* node_logo.eps - Use Inkscape to export an EPS file, making sure to convert text to paths.\r
* node_logo.dxf - Use pstoedit as described on Tony's 2D-to-3D post - tonybuser.com/2d-to-3d - to create a DXF, with simple line approximations of curves. I also ended up using some scaling:\r
\r
  pstoedit -xscale 18 -yscale 18 -dt -f dxf:-polyaslines node_logo.eps node_logo.dxf\r
\r
* node_logo.gcode - Use scribbles.py from GitHub to convert the DXF into Unicorn G-Code. github.com/makerbot/Makerbot\r
\r
I used Pleasant3D for its excellent G-Code preview capabilities to check that everything looked reasonable, find a good scaling, etc.""" ;
