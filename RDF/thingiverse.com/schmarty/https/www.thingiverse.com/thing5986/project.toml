function = "## Deprecation Notice (2020)\r\n\r\nThis plugin has seen a lot more use than expected! Folks were able to adapt it to running their own home-built Arduino-powered CNC machines, and more! Unfortunately, I don't have the time to maintain it, and this code has become stale as Inkscape has changed their APIs over the years.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to fork the project and make updates, you can find it on GitHub here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/martymcguire/inkscape-unicorn\r\n\r\n## Original Summary\r\n\r\nOne problem that has often plagued users of the MakerBot Unicorn[1] is the long and confusing chain of tools required to go from a nice vector drawing to a G-Code file that can be plotted from ReplicatorG.\r\n\r\nmifga did an awesome tutorial[2] that made it possible to understand the steps needed to work all of these tools, but it was obvious that something better was needed.\r\n\r\nSo, I made a mashup of scribbles.py[3] and the Egg-Bot Driver for Inkscape[4] to bring you the **inkscape-unicorn** extension for Inkscape!\r\n\r\nOnce installed, this extension allows you to save files in \"MakerBot Unicorn G-Code (*.gcode)\" format!\r\n\r\nLearn more, download, and contribute at the GitHub page for this project:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/martymcguire/inkscape-unicorn\r\n\r\nIf you're desperate, you can also download the zip file attached to this thing, but it is guaranteed to be out of date. Please get the latest version from GitHub. :)\r\n\r\nThanks to langfordw for the original Unicorn Logo[5] used as an example on this Thing.\r\n\r\nUPDATES (2011)!\r\n\r\nI'm updating and adding features to this script as my first days for the February Thing-A-Day.
