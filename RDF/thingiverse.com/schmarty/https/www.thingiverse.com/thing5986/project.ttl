\r
This plugin has seen a lot more use than expected! Folks were able to adapt it to running their own home-built Arduino-powered CNC machines, and more! Unfortunately, I don't have the time to maintain it, and this code has become stale as Inkscape has changed their APIs over the years.\r
\r

## Original Summary\r
\r
One problem that has often plagued users of the MakerBot Unicorn[1] is the long and confusing chain of tools required to go from a nice vector drawing to a G-Code file that can be plotted from ReplicatorG.\r
\r
mifga did an awesome tutorial[2] that made it possible to understand the steps needed to work all of these tools, but it was obvious that something better was needed.\r
\r
So, I made a mashup of scribbles.py[3] and the Egg-Bot Driver for Inkscape[4] to bring you the **inkscape-unicorn** extension for Inkscape!\r
\r
Once installed, this extension allows you to save files in "MakerBot Unicorn G-Code (*.gcode)" format!\r

If you're desperate, you can also download the zip file attached to this thing, but it is guaranteed to be out of date. Please get the latest version from GitHub. :)\r

Thanks to langfordw for the original Unicorn Logo[5] used as an example on this Thing.\r
