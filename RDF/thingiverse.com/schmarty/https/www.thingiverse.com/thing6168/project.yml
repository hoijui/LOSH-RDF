function: "Making text for Unicorn or EggBot plots isn't always a fun process. Most tools require you to convert text into paths, and even then you get the outlines of shapes, which can often turn messy at small sizes.\r\n\r\nmifga pointed me towards the Hershey fonts[1]. They're a set of fonts for vector plotters named after creator Dr. A. V. Hershey who made them for the National Bureau of Standards.\r\n\r\nThese files are in a weird, weird, format. But after some normalizing, wailing, and gnashing of teeth, I was able to write some code to parse them and spit them back out as SVG! Now you can use these fonts in your Unicorn drawings.\r\n\r\nEach SVG contains a layout of one of the Hershey fonts. The hershey_svg.zip file below contains all of the SVG files. The hershey.zip file contains the (cleaned up) original .jhf files. math-drawing.svg is just an example of using these glyphs, including scaling and stretching. I think the result is nice!\r\n\r\nTo use these in Unicorn plots, you'll want to grab my Unicorn G-Code extension for Inkscape[2].\r\n\r\n[1] Hershey fonts - http://emergent.unpythonic.net/software/hershey\r\n[2] Unicorn output for Inkscape - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5986"
