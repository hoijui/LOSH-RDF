function = "To go with the new multiple-color plotting functionality of my Unicorn G-Code Output extension for Inkscape, here's a new version of the Baltimore Node logo.\r\n\r\nThis one is ready to plot in 2 layers - all of the black parts at once, followed by all of the blue ones, with a pause at the beginning of each layer to allow a pen change.\r\n\r\nI also made use of my Hershey Fonts in SVG to make the word \"baltimore\" more readable after plotting. This should make it look nice, for example, on an EggBot.\r\n\r\nUPDATE!\r\n\r\nI forgot to resize the original for a sticky note pad (whoops!) and I was right that the EggBot version needed layers beginning with a number.\r\n\r\nUpdated files attached and pictures added!\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n* Unicorn Inkscape extension: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5986\r\n* Hershey Fonts in SVG: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6168"
