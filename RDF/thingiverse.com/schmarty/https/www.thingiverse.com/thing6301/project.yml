function: "After seeing Allan's \"*sta\" post on the Thingiverse blog[1], I couldn't help but actually make the \"star-sta\" a reality.\r\n\r\nThis is technically a derivative of yzorg's Gangsta[2], but since I haven't actually printed it, I don't feel right clicking \"I Made One\".\r\n\r\nThanks to tbuser for his 2D to 3D tutorial[3] which has the right pstoedit voodoo required to export things sanely from Inkscape to OpenSCAD.\r\n\r\nThanks to Inkscape for having a Star tool.\r\n\r\nThanks to MCAD for the oval generation code.[4]\r\n\r\nThanks to OpenSCAD for making ridiculous things like this possible.\r\n\r\nThanks to cibomahto for creating this mash-up madness.\r\n\r\n[1] *sta - http://blog.thingiverse.com/2011/02/10/sta/\r\n[2] Gangsta by yzorg - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5367\r\n[3] 2D to 3D - http://tonybuser.com/2d-to-3d\r\n[4] MCAD - https://github.com/elmom/MCAD"
