function = "This AppleTV Mount was designed by an 8th Grader to solve a real-world problem. AppleTVs are relatively cheap and offer some amazing features, so we wanted to add these quickly and simply to our AV systems in classrooms. We wanted to mount AppleTVs directly to the projector, and neither velcro or double-sided tape could handle the job."
