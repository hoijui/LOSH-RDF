function: "This is a simple safety mechanism that I designed to prevent a stove from being turned on when people lean against it.\r\n\r\nWhen I have parties in my apartment, people tend to lean against the stove and accidentally turn the gas on.  Obviously, this is bad.  The Stove Stopper 3000 fits snugly between the knob and the stove face-plate to prevent the knob from being depressed, and therefore, from turning."
