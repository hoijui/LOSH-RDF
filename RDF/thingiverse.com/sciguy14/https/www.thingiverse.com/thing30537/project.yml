function: "This stand is perfect for your embedded computer vision projects!  I originally designed it to use with my \"LibeTech QR code-based Door Lock\" system, but you could use it for lots of other purposes as well.  It is suitable for sitting on your desk, or for mounting to a wall.\r\n\r\nLearn More about the LibeTech system for which this was designed on my website ( http://www.jeremyblum.com/portfolio/libetech ) or at http://www.libetech.com"
