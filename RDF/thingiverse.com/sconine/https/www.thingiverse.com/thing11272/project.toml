function = "This is a basic knob I designed to replace a similar one that I broke off a powermatic table saw rip fence.  This knob has a hole in the bottom that a 3/8\" threaded rod screws nicely into.  I used vicegrips to hold the rod while screwing it into mine.  The hole is ~1\" deep in the knob so size your threaded rod appropriately."
