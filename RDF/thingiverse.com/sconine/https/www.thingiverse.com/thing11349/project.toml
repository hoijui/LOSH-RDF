function = "My kids love the octopus, and kept asking for a starfish.  This did the trick!  I drew this in sketchup freehand.  It took quite some time to get the surface right.  Looks very topographic once printed.  A great flat bottomed animal for the Makerbot.  Perhaps a flounder is next up :)  \nUpdate: This prints really well if you scale it up as well, I've printed it so that it just fits on the build platform, takes a bit longer, but comes out great.  Sort of neat that the ends of the feet tend to curl up a little due to the heating/cooling of the plastic.  \nWas very odd but overnight these things crawled up on a few rocks I'd left on the table...  \nUpdate 10/15/2011: if your original needs a companion, check out Squiggly version."
