function = "This is a tub cap that fits on top of a Cannondale lefty fork.  I lost the original that came with the bikes.  I made 2 versions: one has a longer throat portion and it a bit tighter (it also has a circle on the top... something to look at while on the bike for hours).  The other is plain."
