function: "This is a variation on my original train: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11101  This version has wheels that work on a normal wood track (also print-able on the 3D printer here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8805)  Another option is available here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4041\r\n\r\nI think the original ones, on track that looks like RR track look a lot cooler, but from a functional, push them around the track, standpoint these are a lot better.  They work as well as the magnetic ones that generally come with the wooden sets.\r\n\r\nThe bodies for my original train work on this body, so jump over to that one and download away if you want different tops for the body.  I debated posting this as a new item, vs. adding to my old one.  The file list and explaination etc... on that one seemed a bit overwhelming, so figured starting a clean one was better."
