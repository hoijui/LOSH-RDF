function = "This is a fun little mechanical gadget.  I think it is called a fast return actuator.  Turn the crank clockwise and the bird swings back and forth with a very satisfying pecking motion.  I made something similar out of wood years ago, pretty fun to be able to draw it in sketchup and print it out."
