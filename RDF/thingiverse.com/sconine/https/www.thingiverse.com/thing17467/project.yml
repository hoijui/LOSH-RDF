function: My 6 year old daughter painted a house boat  at school, showed me the photo and asked me to print it in 3D, the photo is the painting she did, and here's the house boat I printed.  She was pretty psyched.  It is interesting when I've show this printer to kids, they often will show me a photo and say "print this car" or whatever the photo is.  It is fun to make that happen once in a while.
