    okh:function """Flat bottom sea dwellers rejoice! Ever since drawing a starfish, I've been thinking about other animals with rather "flat" bottoms. The flounder was a top contender and I finally got around to it. Flounder are such a funny looking animal. They are a great example of asymmetry in an animal. There are a bunch of prototypes in the first photo. Took a while to get the drawing to the point where it printed well and didn't look too geometric.\r

I also uploaded a photo of a flounder I saw while snorkeling in the Caribbean this December.\r
