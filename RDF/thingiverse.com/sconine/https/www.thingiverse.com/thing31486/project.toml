function = "Take a side photo of someone you know, import it into sketchup, trace their profile.  Give it depth, export as an STL file, print it out, buy a 4x6 frame, a little blue tape on the back and voila!  A great gift!  We're thinking of making a bunch of these for Christmas gifts this year.  Fast to print and have a really neat modern/retro look when framed."
