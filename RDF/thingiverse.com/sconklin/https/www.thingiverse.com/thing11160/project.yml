function: "These are a set of clips which hold 10mm LEDs to illuminate the extruder tip on a Makerbot cupcake.\r\n\r\nThe plain clip fits on the semicircular area on the back of the center cutout, and the Left and Right clips fit on the front edges of the cutout and point the LEDs toward the extruder tip.\r\n\r\nThese were designed using openscad and printed with black ABS. I had to cut the strings out of the LED holes."
