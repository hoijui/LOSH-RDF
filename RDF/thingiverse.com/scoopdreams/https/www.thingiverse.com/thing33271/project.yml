function: "This is a simple bracket to hold acrylic windows and allow them to slide out easily.\r\n\r\nMy prints were curling badly because it was windy and by placing acrylic windows around the openings, it helped tremendously.\r\n\r\nSee the pictures for acrylic windows dimensions. You can get them made for really cheap."
