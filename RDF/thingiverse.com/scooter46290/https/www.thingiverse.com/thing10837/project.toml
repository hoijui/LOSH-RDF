function = "This is to help you be a better sniper, pilot or whatever game you play that you want to have faster movements and still be precise.\r\n\r\n!\r\nThis is for the Non rubber coated joysticks. It will be tight on most remotes. Someone let me know what we need to scale it up to to fit I will upload a new version. \r\n!\r\n\r\n This thing snaps onto your standard PlayStation controller for more precise movements and aiming. \r\n\r\nDuring use:\r\nSet your sensitivity higher and make smaller joystick movements."
