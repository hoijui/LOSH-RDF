\rMy wife was complaining about the odor in the basement from all the melted plastic.  I looked at some fume extractors, but they all worked on enclosing stuff off and sucking large amounts of air through the whole machine.  I wanted to make something that works like a solder fume extractor where the nozzle is near the source of the odor and sucks those fumes in.\r
\r
I came up with this design.  It is not perfect, but my wife is no longer complaining about smells now.\r
\r
Uses a simple carbon furnace filter cut to fit and an 80mm case fan.  I attached the fan to the extruder fan power so it only kicks on when the heat is up on the extruder.""" ;
