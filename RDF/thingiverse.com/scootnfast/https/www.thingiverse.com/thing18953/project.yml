function: "All the little wisps of smoke that come off the extruder from time to time are quickly sucked right up!\r\n\rMy wife was complaining about the odor in the basement from all the melted plastic.  I looked at some fume extractors, but they all worked on enclosing stuff off and sucking large amounts of air through the whole machine.  I wanted to make something that works like a solder fume extractor where the nozzle is near the source of the odor and sucks those fumes in.\r\n\r\nI came up with this design.  It is not perfect, but my wife is no longer complaining about smells now.\r\n\r\nUses a simple carbon furnace filter cut to fit and an 80mm case fan.  I attached the fan to the extruder fan power so it only kicks on when the heat is up on the extruder."
