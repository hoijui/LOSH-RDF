function: "This is a replacement part for the thumb roller hook that broke on one of my dial calipers.  I made the part by injection molding polypropylene.  I included the model files used to make the aluminum mold.\r\n\r\nI don't know how often these things break but I couldn't find a direct replacement for mine.  I did see some company selling a similar part that might have worked for ~$8. I think I bought the caliper for about $15.\r\n\r\nAdditional information about my injection molding process can be found at http://www.scorchworks.com/Injection_molding/injection_molding.html"
