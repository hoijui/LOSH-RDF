\r
Update 10/30/2011: After playing hockey on the kitchen counter for a day I decided the kids needed a proper hockey rink to play on.  So I built a little play area for them on a piece of scrap wood.  I added a picture to show how it turned out.\r
\r
We even developed rules:\r
1. The neutral zone is a free for all you can hit each other sticks etc.\r
\r
2. A players stick/hand cannot enter the opposing players zone.  (i.e. you can not put your hand past the other players blue line)\r
\r
3. only the blade of your stick can contact the playing surface.  (i.e. you can not rest your hand on the board)\r
\r
Official rink size:\r
Width: As wide as the piece of wood you have\r
Length: Long enough to make it look right about right""" ;
