    okh:function """This is a pen cap with connecting features to make geometric shapes including a truncated icosahedron.  This item was inspired by other pen cap items on Thingiverse http://www.thingiverse.com/tag:bic\r
\r
\r
180 pen cap parts assembled make a "BICky ball" (AKA: truncated icosahedron, bucky ball, c60 and buckminsterfullerene)\r
\r
60 pen cap parts assembled make a dodecahedron. (The last two pictures show the dodecahedrons)\r
\r
The large "BICky ball" was not able to support itself so I had to build it with something to support it on the bottom.  (the support is an upside down mini-trampoline covered with a sheet)\r
\r
I uploaded a video of the shapes and the connectors to YouTube http://youtu.be/rWfps0nxLuI The end of the video shows that the caps also mate with Lego small ball joint parts.""" ;
