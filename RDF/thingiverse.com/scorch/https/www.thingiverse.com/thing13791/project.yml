function: "This is a pen cap with connecting features to make geometric shapes including a truncated icosahedron.  This item was inspired by other pen cap items on Thingiverse http://www.thingiverse.com/tag:bic\r\n\r\n\r\n180 pen cap parts assembled make a \"BICky ball\" (AKA: truncated icosahedron, bucky ball, c60 and buckminsterfullerene)\r\n\r\n60 pen cap parts assembled make a dodecahedron. (The last two pictures show the dodecahedrons)\r\n\r\nThe large \"BICky ball\" was not able to support itself so I had to build it with something to support it on the bottom.  (the support is an upside down mini-trampoline covered with a sheet)\r\n\r\nI uploaded a video of the shapes and the connectors to YouTube http://youtu.be/rWfps0nxLuI The end of the video shows that the caps also mate with Lego small ball joint parts."
