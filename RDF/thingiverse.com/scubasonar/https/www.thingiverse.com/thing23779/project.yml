function: "Landing gear that is fond of concrete.\r\n\r\nMr. Lander is an unofficial replacement for the fiberglass landing gear that came with a 3DR ArduCopter by DIYDrones. He is being removed from our universe and rejoining it in an iterative cycle of improvement. He's not a fancy landing gear for standing high above the ground, but he is growing a fondness for concrete."
