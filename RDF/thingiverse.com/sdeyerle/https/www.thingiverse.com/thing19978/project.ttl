    okh:function """This is a stackable Raspberry Pi case I'm working on to allow you to build small clusters of Raspberry Pi's.  I don't touch CAD much (I'm an electrical engineer), but I'm pretty happy with this attempt.  \r
\r
I used the dimensions for the Raspberry Pi provided by Gert from the Raspberry Pi forums (http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/projects-and-collaboration-general/beta-boards-mechanical-data), so it may not be totally accurate yet.\r
\r
I printed this using a Stratasys uPrint SE in the Configurable Computing Lab at Virginia Tech  (http://www.ccm.ece.vt.edu).  These guys are awesome / I work here, so I need to give the obligatory shoutout.  I have no idea how it would perform on a MakerBot, but it came out pretty well on the uPrint. \r
\r
Also note, I have made a few modifications between the printed pictures and the uploaded STLs.  I removed my name and my lab name, and fixed a few mistakes I didn't catch before my first printing.\r
\r
Hope you guys like it!""" ;
