function: "This is a stackable Raspberry Pi case I'm working on to allow you to build small clusters of Raspberry Pi's.  I don't touch CAD much (I'm an electrical engineer), but I'm pretty happy with this attempt.  \r\n\r\nI used the dimensions for the Raspberry Pi provided by Gert from the Raspberry Pi forums (http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/projects-and-collaboration-general/beta-boards-mechanical-data), so it may not be totally accurate yet.\r\n\r\nI printed this using a Stratasys uPrint SE in the Configurable Computing Lab at Virginia Tech  (http://www.ccm.ece.vt.edu).  These guys are awesome / I work here, so I need to give the obligatory shoutout.  I have no idea how it would perform on a MakerBot, but it came out pretty well on the uPrint. \r\n\r\nAlso note, I have made a few modifications between the printed pictures and the uploaded STLs.  I removed my name and my lab name, and fixed a few mistakes I didn't catch before my first printing.\r\n\r\nHope you guys like it!"
