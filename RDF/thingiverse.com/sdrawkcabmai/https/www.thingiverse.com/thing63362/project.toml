function = "10 cm x 10 cm x 1 cm, this maze is designed for my Latin project. In the center I will put a minotaur head, and in the other open corner a sword. The goal is for Theseus (the ball) to find his sword in the labyrinth before he finds the minotaur, or else he will die. There is a raised post by the entrance to tie a string to, so the player can follow his ball's path through the maze and find his way back after killing the minotaur"
