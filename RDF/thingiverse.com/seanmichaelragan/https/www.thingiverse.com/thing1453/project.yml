function: "This is a set of solid pentominoes, each of which is based on one of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac.  They are based on originals by Japanese schoolteacher Sabu Oguro as published on p. 40 of Jerry Slocum and Jack Botermans' 1986 book Puzzles Old & New: How to Make and Solve Them.  All parts printed via MakerBot, and photographs, by Becky Stern.  Becky will be streaming live video of her MakerBot printing some of these pieces at 10 AM PST on Friday, December 18, on her Ustream channel at:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ustream.tv/channel/sternlab"
