    okh:function """This is an hexagonally-tessellating lizard tile closely based on M.C. Escher's famous design.  This vector art has lived on my old personal homepage, since 2008, at   
http://www.seanmichaelragan.com/html/%5B2008-04-18%5D_MC_Escher_lizard_vector_art.shtml  
Recently, Angus Hines (angushines.com) downloaded it and used it to lasercut a bunch of ~3" tiles in fluorescent acrylic (which are shown in the attached images), and it occurred to me it was probably time to share these files on Thingiverse.   
Update 2011-12-15: Angus just sent me these photos of some lizards printed on  FDM/FFF equipment, and I've uploaded them, as well as the .STL and .CDR files he sent along with.   Thanks, Angus!  
Update 2012-02-28: I've added a version of the vector art with a 1/16" diameter pinhole in the tiling center, which allows the tile to be easily and discretely secured to a wall using a small brad. Details here:
