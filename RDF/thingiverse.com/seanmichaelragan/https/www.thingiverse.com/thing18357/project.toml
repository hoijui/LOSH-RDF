A rite of passage, perhaps?  So that first-timers are obliged to figure out how to rotate the model before they can print it?  If so, sorry to break with tradition, but it seems decidedly beginner-unfriendly.\r\n\r\nThis is the exact same model, but it has been rotated into an upright position, centered at the origin along X and Y axes, and positioned with its lower extremity exactly on the origin along the Z-axis."
