...a small shot glass which should be water (ahem) tight when printed on a properly set-up machine.  \r

It has been uploaded to Thingiverse before:\r

\r
For whatever reasons, however, both here and on the original RepRap wiki, the minimug model has been presented rotated on its side, in an unprintable position.  A rite of passage, perhaps?  So that first-timers are obliged to figure out how to rotate the model before they can print it?  If so, sorry to break with tradition, but it seems decidedly beginner-unfriendly.\r
\r
This is the exact same model, but it has been rotated into an upright position, centered at the origin along X and Y axes, and positioned with its lower extremity exactly on the origin along the Z-axis.""" ;
