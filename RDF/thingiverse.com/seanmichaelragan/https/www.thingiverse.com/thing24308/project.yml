function: "A dodecahedron speaker can be a useful tool in acoustics research, and is definitely a fun toy to pull out at parties.  They are available commercially, but pretty expensive.  Some people build their own, but the odd compound angles and the high degree of accuracy and precision required in the parts make for challenging work with manual tools.  It's a perfect job for a 3D printer.  Total cost for parts and materials is just under $100.  That includes speakers, hardware, wires, cable, plastic filament - everything.  \r\n\r\nJanuary 16, 2015  \r\n\r\nI recently made my original SketchUp files for these parts publicly available at this link:  \r\n\r\nhttps://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/collection.html?id=uc448c896-3f80-41d2-a0d3-0c2685e74d84  \r\n\r\nThese may be useful to anyone who wants to adapt the design to their own equipment."
