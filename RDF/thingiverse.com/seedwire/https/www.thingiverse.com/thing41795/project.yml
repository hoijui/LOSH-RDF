function: "Update: v2 fixes some taller printing problems with more support and a better \"ledge\" to prevent the high torques that will topple the bolt. Also, improved the base and handle to make it easier to grab... and fixed a tolerance problem that made the bolt and outer shell waaaaay too tight on most printers.  \n\nUpdate: just found this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1481   \n which is a more original version of this thing... very cool and I wish had found it sooner!  \nDon't hate the bolt maze- embrace the bolt   \nmaze!  \nAn outer tube (with parameterized accents) protects an inner chamber which can be revealed by solving the underlying bolt maze.  \nMany folks don't know what a \"bolt maze\" is... it's not just a pattern of a maze on a bolt! To remove the bolt's nut you must rotate and translate the nut (which has a pin, not a thread) through the maze. It's surprisingly hard to do!  \nThis contraption is a bolt maze proper with a nut attached to an outer tube which protects the hollow inards of the bolt. At 75% full build space of a Rep1 the chamber easily stores a cache of M&Ms or other small candies- great fun for kids, although, the default maze (see .scad) is a bit difficult for the 6 and under crowd. (i.e., they're more likely to simply crack the thing apart)"
