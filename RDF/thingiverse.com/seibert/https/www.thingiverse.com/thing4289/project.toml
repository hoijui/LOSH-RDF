function = "Home Depot used to sell this neat modular shelving system called \"Peg-Lok\".  It consisted of various pre-cut boards held together with press-fit pegs that could be combined in a variety of ways to make linked shelving units.  After recently moving across country, I sadly discovered that all my Peg-Lok pegs had been lost.  Fortunately, there was one loose peg in a box, which provided the template to design a replacement.\r\n\r\nIf you have access to a decent saw and jig for cutting angles, you can easily make these tapered pegs by cutting 7/8\" dowels into 1.5\" long segments, then cutting diagonally across the segments at a 10 degree angle.  However, if you have a 3D printer and no wood tools, this model is for you!"
