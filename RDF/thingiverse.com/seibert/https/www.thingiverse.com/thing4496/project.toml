function = "Is your pumpkin feeling inferior due to lack of a festive stem?  Do you have no way to easily remove the lid on your stemless Jack-o'-lantern?  Stuck in an impromptu game of curling with a stone shortage?  No problem!  Turn your pumpkin into a cyborg super-pumpkin with this printable prosthetic stem.\r\n\r\nWe bought a pumpkin from a local patch this weekend, but realized later it had no stem.  I sliced out the stem portion of the excellent thing:4473 model, and mounted it to a hollow cylinder with some \"threads.\"  Although the flat plate between the cylinder and the stem is unsupported, if you turn your MakerBot extrusion flow rate down or up the X-Y travel rate you should be fine.  The sagging seems to be acceptable in my tests and isn't visible from the top."
