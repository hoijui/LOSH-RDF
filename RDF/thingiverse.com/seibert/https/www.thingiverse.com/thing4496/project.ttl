We bought a pumpkin from a local patch this weekend, but realized later it had no stem.  I sliced out the stem portion of the excellent thing:4473 model, and mounted it to a hollow cylinder with some "threads."  Although the flat plate between the cylinder and the stem is unsupported, if you turn your MakerBot extrusion flow rate down or up the X-Y travel rate you should be fine.  The sagging seems to be acceptable in my tests and isn't visible from the top.""" ;
