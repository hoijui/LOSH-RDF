function: "This is an OpenSCAD design for a rounded cap to put over something flat and pointy, like a knife blade.  My wife ice climbs, and therefore owns a variety of sharp pointy objects without covers.  Thanks to the Automated Build Platform, she now has two dozen little covers for each of the crampon points and covers for each of her ice axes.\r\n\r\nNote that the design includes a small tab at the base that you can drill a hole into for an attachment cord.  This will be used to keep all the crampon caps together in an elastic loop."
