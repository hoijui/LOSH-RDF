function = "My name is Michael Raphael and I am a SFX recordist for Film and Games.  I have been working on a Small Motors sound library for my company http://rabbitearsaudio.com . I reached out to Matt Giffin at Maker Bot Industries because I  wanted a real robot to make robot sounds for the library.  Matt was incredibly enthusiastic and hooked me up with Charles Pax, who programmed the Maker Bot to perform a variety of actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI m excited to share the fruits of our labor on Thingiverse."
