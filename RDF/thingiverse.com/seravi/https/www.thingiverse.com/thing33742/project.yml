function: "Some of my warping problems I attribute to drafts from my RAMPS fan and PSU.  As a result I devised these friction clips to hold 2mm sheets of acrylic (or printed material) to prevent drafts from flowing directly over the heated print bed.  I have tweaked the design so they should work fine on the vertical beams as well (holding their position), and four clips should hold a sheet of acrylic across the front or the back pretty well.  Rail version (10cm single piece) works, but the insert seems too fragile, perhaps due to the way the piece is built.  Perhaps the rail version should be printed along the Z axis with concentric infill like the printed t-slot beam.  When I get more ABS in I will resume work on the rail version.  I don't have a proper sized piece of clear acrylic right now, but I used some acrylic that I had used in PLA printing tests, and only 2 clips held the acrylic in place for several hours of printing with a lot of vibration and rocking, and the acrylic stayed in place.  You'd need clearance for the build platform, and you still need to access the build area, but you could at least reduce drafts and prevent heat loss.\r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad.
