function: "Z-System is an effort to make a standard for 3D printable game hexes for tactical miniatures combat.  Basic tile system designed by Nildex.  Most of the basic terrain types and game system designed by Seravi.  Translations from English to Japanese done by Mierinco.  Playtesting done by Grory159.  The castle cap is derived from kyle59's Minecraft Castle.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI haven't touched the system in years,but I decided it was time for an update, as I am using it in a current game.  For faster setup, I have 7 base tiles welded together.  I also have 3 plain base hexes welded together.  This can be used for large areas of the same terrain type, or link them to act as a base for things like structures or large, multi-hex terrain features.\r\n\r\nI also added Tac Hex Building 1-5, if you are looking for terrain for a 50m = 1 hex scale.  I also print out scatter terrain and use it for 28mm figures that use hexes."
