    okh:function """Thinking of Derivative as something that comes out from something else; the use and shape of this key is a derivative of the regular house keys. I wanted to â€œupgradeâ€x9d this elemental object using the power and precision of 3D printing. \r
\r
There are 3 main aspects this key reinforces or improves on the design conventions:\r
\r
Security: \r
In the regular process of creating a key the â€œcodingâ€x9d surface is limited by the production technique. Many times the blade is not complex enough and many locks can be opened by an experienced thief with a pin. In 3D printing there are less limitations and the Coding surface can incorporate more complex shapes, and in a larger area in different axis, making it more complex to copy. \r
\r
Also a 3D key is a key you donâ€™t have to carry around, you can print it only when you need it and even destroy it later, it canÂ´t be stolen, you can upload safely your keys into the cloud, (much safer than real life)\r
\r
Practicality: Keys are normally made of steel, but that is not necessary, keys can be made out of any material as long as the shape of the blade matches perfectly with the wards in the keyway. Imagine the benefits of softer keys; have you ever had any problem with keys at the airport? Have you ever scratched your cell phone with your keys in your pockets?\r
\r
Portability: When was the last time you lost your keys? Do you remember all that search around your house for hours, days, or weeks? Do you remember how expensive was the locksmith? The idea here would be that if you lost your keys you download them from your mail, open the password protected file, and print them right away, before you get late to work.""" ;
