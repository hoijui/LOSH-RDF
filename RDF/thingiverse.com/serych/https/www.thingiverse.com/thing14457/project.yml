function: "This is my first thing, so it is pretty primitive. I couldn't find the right bushing for my ABS spool (inner diameter 52.5 mm) and standard 608 bearings, so I created parametric part in OpenSCAD. Now you can modify both diameters (inner and outer) of the bushing very easily in the beginning of the OpenSCAD file. \r\n\r\nThe generated STL file is for 52.5 mm (spool)/22 mm (bearing). \r\n\r\nThe shape of inner and outer diameter is not cylindrical but octagonal for the higher flexibility to insert the bearing and put the bushing to the spool."
