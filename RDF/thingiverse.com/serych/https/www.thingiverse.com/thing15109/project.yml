function: "I have bought head for photographic flash umbrella which works fine, but has one big construction error. \r\n\r\nThe umbrella stake hole in the head is parallel with the flash reflector direction. As the reflector is usually located on the highest place of the flash unit, it is off umbrella axis so the flash is not shining uniformly to the umbrella. The solution is to tilt the flash unit so, that the reflector is shining to the center of umbrella. \r\n\r\nSo I created semiparametric SDAD file for the tilt insert. I'm using tilt angle of 8 deg for my Nikon SB800 flash (the generated STL file is for that angle), but you can change that parameter to suit your type of the flash. The higher is the position of reflector, the bigger must be the angle."
