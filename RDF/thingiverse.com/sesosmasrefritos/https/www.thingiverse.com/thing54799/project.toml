Bottom layer still fuses, but a little wet sanding with some emery paper helps.\r\n\r\nI wanted a bearing I could use as a guide for driving small fasteners, so this slips over a 1/4\" hex drive shaft and lets me get a grip on the front end with minimal finger damage.\r\n\r\nThanks to Emmett for the fantastic design!\r\n\r\nCreated with Customizer! http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=53451"
