function: "Updated: Now with Facial Hair!\r\n\r\nInspired by the Nintendo Wii's \"Mii\", this thing is a 3D character maker - it allows the user to choose different facial features, hair, etc to make a custom 3D avatar.\r\n\r\nHyper-realistic 3D scans are becoming more commonplace, and this is not an effort to compete - think of this more as the cartoon version of yourself, or make up a character altogether!"
