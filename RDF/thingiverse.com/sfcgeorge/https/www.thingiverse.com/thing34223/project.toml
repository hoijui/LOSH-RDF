function = "I built this box to keep my Printrbot Original in, and make it easier to transport.\r\n\r\nThe PSU is above the back protrusion of the print bed to save space (see pics).\r\n\r\nWhen the lid is up the bed can extend fully forwards, and the lid doubles up as a spool holder.\r\n\r\nWhen closed the box looks very nondescript (to pass uni room inspections). There is a handle on top for easy carrying. The usb cable and power cable can also be stowed in the box.\r\n\r\nThe box is built of scraps of wood I had already. Hence I've listed as \"work in progress\" as you would have to redesign it to suit your printer size and construction materials.\r\n\r\nThe PSU template is not my design but I can't remember where I got it from, sorry original author! I posted here as I struggled to find such a template."
