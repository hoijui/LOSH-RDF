function: This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/iliK4XGlHSzWe installed an Apollo oil tank level meter not knowing the tank contained steel braces which gave incorrect readings. Relocating the sensor left a gaping hole so we printed this plug exactly matching the body of the meter.
