function = "After seeing the other headphone hanger designs, and finding they didn't quite fit my Ikea Vika Amon desk, I decided to build my own.  In particular my design idea is based off of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17531 - though my design did not modify his.  (please let me know if this is considered a derivative!)  \n\n\n\nThe only issue I had was my original object was 40mm wide, which proved to be a bit much.  I've reduced the STL to 20mm."
