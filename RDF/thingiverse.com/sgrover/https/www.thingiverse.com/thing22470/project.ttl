I downloaded and printed one which promptly broke (the gap was just a bit too small to slide over the edge).  There are many many card holders on Thingiverse, but I opted to learn how to design and print my own.  So this is more of an design educational tool for myself.  But it works too.\r
\r
The cards are a little snug, so you may want to widen the gaps by about .5 mm, or just sand them down a little.\r
\r
Designed in FreeCAD, and the file is included below.""" ;
