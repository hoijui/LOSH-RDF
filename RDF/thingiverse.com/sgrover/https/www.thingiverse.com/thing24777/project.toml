function = "CrazyJaw did a great job with his keychain sized heart gears.  But if anyone is considering building more than one, it could take a while to print.  So, I applied JoeyC's dual-strusion script (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24195 - which itself is a derivative of thorstadg's work) to print two of each file object(s) at once. \r\n\r\nTo allow this to work, I had to re-organize the objects a little.\r\n- The large plate is the busiest and had to do some interesting arrangements due to the size of the parts.\r\n- I doubled up the number of pins so that when dual-struded a complete set is made.  Further changes should probably do a full set with one extruder so that dual-struding produces two sets to match the two hearts that are produced.\r\n- the center.stl file is the original file untouched.\r\n- the small plate just moves the parts into a vertical line\r\n\r\nBTW - this was specifically done for a Replicator.  The nozzle separation on other printers may require further tweaking."
