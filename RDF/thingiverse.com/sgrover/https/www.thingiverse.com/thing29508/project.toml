function = "EpicFail's original Frog Fiend is a fantastic piece.  However the overhanging toes means rafts/supports are needed to print the piece.  Removing the supports is a pain, and can result in lost detail.  So in the interest of less post-print effort, I sliced off the toes so things sit nice and flat.  This is the only change to an otherwise great and fun model."
