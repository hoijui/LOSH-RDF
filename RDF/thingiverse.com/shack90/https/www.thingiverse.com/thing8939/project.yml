function: "This is a AA Battery Storage Holder that hold 4 AA.  while back i was looking for a battery holder for my camera case and was surprised to find that they where are hard to find. So now that i have a 3d printer i thought why not print one.  \r\nAA4Bottom Size 2 is for rechargeable batteries i have found that some rechargeable batteries are a little larger then standard batteries, so if you printed the first one i posted and the batteries don't fit then try this one."
