I have upload 5 different base sizes from 1 inch to 2.5 inch so you can print the top section that holds the coins and pick witch base that will give you the right height for you cup holder. Also this will make it handing if you decide to move it to a different cup holder that all you have to do is print a new base and not the hole thing. another plus is now you can rotate the coin holder. \r\nI have all so upload a coin holder lid that will snap on the top so when you move your coin holder you won't lose any of you coins.\r\nThe base and lid will be snug so you make need to do a little clean up to make them if as easy as you want."
