function = "I needed to be able to operate my Replicator 1 Dual remotely, and using Teamviewer with a webcam was the obvious solution.  This Thing clips over the front perspex cover of the Bilby Replicator Add-on Kit from www.bilbycnc.com.au/machines/MakerbotReplicator.asp and accepts a Microsoft LifeCam HD5000 webcam.  Easily removable if required (just slip it off the cover) but hinges out of the way nicely whenever you need to open the Replicator for access."
