function = "The Openscad script below allows for the printing of custom spool holders for the Makerbot Replicator.  These holders not only allow for different spindle widths and depths but also a different offset from the support holes in the back of the Replicator.  You can thus print with different spools than those supplied by Makerbot.  \n\nThe design allows for printing without support to give as much strength as possible to the spool holders.  \n\n**Update 5th April 2013:**  \n\n- Added a new 15mm collar to strengthen bottom of spool holder.  \n- Added customizer.  \n- Added recommended print settings."
