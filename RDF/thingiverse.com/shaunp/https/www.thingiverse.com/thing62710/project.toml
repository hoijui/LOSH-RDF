function = "I have several coils of multi-coloured loose filament which  I wanted to use on my Replicator. This spool design allows for easy resizing of the spokes for fitting into loose spools of filament and reuse on other spools.    There is no need to wind on the filament as with some other solutions.  I can mount both the smaller but thicker USA sourced filament coils and the larger New Zealand sourced filament coils on my Replicator. Options are provided for mounting on the back of a Replicator 1 (and possibly other models) as well as for external spool holders running on an axis away from the Replicator.  \n\n**Update 19 May 2013:** Thanks to a heads up from MobyDisk I have made a small change which fixes a problem when printing the hub using Repg."
