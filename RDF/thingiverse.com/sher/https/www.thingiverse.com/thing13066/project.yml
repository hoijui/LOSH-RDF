function: The Bugginator is the derivative of tweezers and gardening tools. The Bugginator is designed to grab, hold, remove, relocate, and exterminate bug invaders of gardens, houses, and anywhere where there are unwanted varmints. It improves existing designs because there are no tools specifically designed for removing or exterminating  bugs without the use of chemicals.  Its better to use the Bugginator instead of using regular tweezers, gloves, or pliers because the Bugginator is designed with edges that are wide, elongated, and serrated. That way it is much harder for the bug to escape, no matter what kind of bug it is.  It is much easier to pick up and handle bugs with this tool.
