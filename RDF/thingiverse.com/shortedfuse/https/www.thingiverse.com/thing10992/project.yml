function: I am building a CNC machine and needed a pen holder to do some testing.  This is the result, it worked very well and is so easy.  Its designed to work with the new Sharpie fine point pen, but you could make it work with most any pen that has a round barrel. In the picture you can see its plotting out a PCB board.
