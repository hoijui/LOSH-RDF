    okh:function """U-Box for an Olimex Olinuxino MAXI board. The Olinuxino is Open Hardware by Olimex, and runs Linux on a 454MHz ARM9 processor with 64MB RAM. For more information on this board, have a look at https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/iMX233/iMX233-OLinuXino-MAXI/\r
\r
The design includes 2 circular nubs to provide support underneath the board, although at this size, it probably isn't necessary, but it made me feel good to have them.\r
\r
If you have the Olinuxino-MINI instead of this Maxi, it should also fit, although I don't have a MINI to test the fit. If you have the Olinuxino-Micro, you could check out this Thing instead: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27101""" ;
