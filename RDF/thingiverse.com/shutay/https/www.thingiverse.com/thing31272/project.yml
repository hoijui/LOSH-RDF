function: "U-Box for an Olimex Olinuxino MAXI board. The Olinuxino is Open Hardware by Olimex, and runs Linux on a 454MHz ARM9 processor with 64MB RAM. For more information on this board, have a look at https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/iMX233/iMX233-OLinuXino-MAXI/\r\n\r\nThe design includes 2 circular nubs to provide support underneath the board, although at this size, it probably isn't necessary, but it made me feel good to have them.\r\n\r\nIf you have the Olinuxino-MINI instead of this Maxi, it should also fit, although I don't have a MINI to test the fit. If you have the Olinuxino-Micro, you could check out this Thing instead: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27101"
