function = "I designed this \"Better PCB poker\" tool after trying Madox's PCB Poker for UP! 3D printer. I found that the pins used in Madox's poker kept bending on me, so I went about looking for something stronger, found these push pins to be just the thing. What I needed then was a holder to make it more comfortable to use, something like Madox's original PCB poker."
