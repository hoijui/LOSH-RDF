function: Our two cats love their wet food every morning. So much in fact, that they wake me up at 4:30 a.m. when they are ready to eat. But if they eat too much, they get too fat. So I divide each can of Friskies wet cat food into 3 servings. But I don't always divide it correctly at 4:30 a.m., so I decided to make this cat food serving guide. Print on Makerbot, and then press this into a freshly-opened can of cat food to help make the servings even.
