function = "This is my own take on the illustrious first shotglass.. and the ultimate proof-test for your reprap! \r\nIt's quite a challenge to print as you will have to pause it several times during the narrow bit, or it won't harden in time. That said.. it's completely waterproof, contains about 25cc and it's oh so stylish!\r\n\r\nDo not forget to toast to your trusty reprap with your favourite spirit."
