function: "This is a Mendel90 compatible Tom's guided hinged wade's.\r\n\r\nThe wade provided with the Mendel90 is rather old, so i wanted the same extruder as i have on my Prusa, that one is pointing the wrong way though (limits x movement) So i inverted it.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really slice perfectly since i don't have openSCAD knowledge and just plowed it through 3dsmax, but i printed it and it works, only the guide part might screw up a little (bit i usually end up ripping that off anyway).\r\n\r\nThis is Jhead and similar compatible (big hole in the bottom)"
