function: "This is a box to mount the Sanguinololu mainboard in.\r\nCurrently designed for the 1.3, and heavily WIP.\r\nI intend to make it universal for multiple printers, but mostly for the mendel90 to be hung and clamped onto one of the frame parts.\r\nI will make a lid with fan hole next (any fan type requests will probably be filled)\r\n\r\nWill post picture as soon as print is done.\r\n\r\nNote: Updated the file, fixed height, screwholes and wall thickness.\r\n\r\nAfter building and printing with the box, i realized that it needs some work, it's way too compact and some people have their pins sideways.. I will investigate it when i find the time and redo the model."
