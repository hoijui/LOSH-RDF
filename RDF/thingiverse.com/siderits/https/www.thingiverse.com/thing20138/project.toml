function = "Simple brackets for holding an iPhone in landscape position or Dashboard mount.  Left and Right version are mirror image to asure alignement. I use it in the lab to hold the iphone on instruments while monitoring data feeds. Place adhesive tape under feet, hold feet on end of phone then press phone down on feet to stick brackets in desired location.  \r\n\r\nBig opening leaves room for charger cable on one side while little notch leaves clearance for power switch.  \r\n\r\nMeant to mount in Landscape position. This version is for NO case but you can scale it on one axis to fit with a case."
