function = "You can prototype almost any kind of robotic platform or experimental laboratory equipment with these connectors.  \n\nUpdate 9/15  \n- Plexiglas holder inline, 3 variations, 2.5 mm thickness, used for walls and floors or splash screen in prototype platforms.   \n\nUpdate 6/23/14  \n- Standard servo holders. Mount in-line, single side, dual side, 90 degree.  Ideal if you want to use the maker beam as a skeleton.  Indents show where to drill holes.   \nUpdate: 2/23/2014  \n- Vertical and horizontal limit switch holders for momentary button type normal open type switches.  \nUpdate 9/22/13  \n- 28ByJ-48 Small 5V stepper motor mount both front and side  \n- Files named \"Small Mount Front,Side,Top,Bottom respectively.  \nUpdate 7/14/13  \n- Vertical stepper mounting plate  \n- Example gallery images of axis motion.  \n- Kit Tamiya Ladder, Chain and Sprocket set Item #70142  \n- 13 tooth gear drive sprocket and idler for Tamiya kit (see above)  \nUPDATE 6/30/13 Thumbwheel parts  \n- Thumb frame  \n- Thumb Pinion gear  \n- Thumb Hold down  \n- Thumb Axle  \nUPDATE 4/13: M6 pan head nut and bolt, stand off.  \nUPDATE 3/13:  \n- Rack for 13 tooth 12 mm pinion gear on a 3.1 Volt Allelectronics Stepper motor.  \n- Added ZIP file of \"Final parts.zip\"  \nUPDATE 2/13:  \nAdded Plexiglass holder  \nInspired by leitenmu at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47087   \nAdded new contours and other parts to the set.  \n-----------------------------------------------  \nThese connectors will allow the fabrication of almost any shape or enclosure, using the 20x20 mm MakerBean type model from dbozec ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27825 ).  Especially desinged to facilitate the construction of experimental laboratory equipment and platforms.  The connectors are meant to be glue-\"welded\" to each other with ABS acetone slurry or cyanomethacrylate (crazy glue).  \nWith these connectors you can do end-end, corner, rail, groove, flat top or plate, sliding surface, T-pieces end to side and side to side connections, wire guides and mounting or fixation parts.
