function = "In surgical pathology, large specimens may require many \"cassettes\" to hold tissue samples.  If the cassettes are labled then stacked on top of each other on the specimen container they can fall over and scatter.  This rack helps keep the cassettes in order and won't allow them to spill and scatter."
