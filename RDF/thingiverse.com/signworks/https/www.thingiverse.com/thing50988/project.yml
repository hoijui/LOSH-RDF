function: "Good way of showing a student the mechanics of how a engine converts back and forth motion to rotation. Was fun designing in my new AlibreCad program. All movments could be simulated and checked for clearance before printing.\r\nIt came out exactly as the simulator showed. After assembling and a little sanding of the cylinder it turned very smoothly."
