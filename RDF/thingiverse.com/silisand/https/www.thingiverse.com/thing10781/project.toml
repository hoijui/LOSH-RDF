function = "I looked around at all the iPad stands out there and wanted to create something that I thought showed off the iPad.  This is the result.  It's made out of 1/4 Acrylic, but you can use anything I would imagine.  The stand comes apart making it easy to stuff into your bag.  It works great on an airplane tray for watching movies"
