\r
Prusa Mendel x carriage using 4 lm8uu linear bearings in screw-fastened holders for easy (dis-)assembly. No zipties, no fragile and imprecise snap-in-brackets.\r
\r
I didn't like the snap-fit bearing holders in Greg Frosts's x carriage for the same reason why jonaskuehling made the slim LM8UU holder derivate. So I modified Greg's carriage and integrated the new bearing holders for an easy-to-disassemble x carriage.\r
\r
I attached the OpenSCAD files including Greg's configuration for some variables and Jonas' lm8uu-holder. I tidied up the source code a bit, but there are still some unnecessary lines left over from greg's code. The code is not overly clean and parametric due to the lack of time.\r
\r
UPDATE 31.01.2012\r
- Reattached Greg's fan mount to the carriage. I updated the OpenSCAD file and added another STL.\r
\r
UPDATE 03.02.2012\r
- One linear bearing could not slide into its bracket since the fan mount was blocking the path. I cut away a little clearance.\r
Not the smartest solution, but quick and functional.""" ;
