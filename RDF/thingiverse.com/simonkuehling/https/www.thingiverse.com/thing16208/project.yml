function: "*** I highly recommend using the further improved design at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18657, that jonaskuehling uploaded recently ***\r\n\r\nPrusa Mendel x carriage using 4 lm8uu linear bearings in screw-fastened holders for easy (dis-)assembly. No zipties, no fragile and imprecise snap-in-brackets.\r\n\r\nI didn't like the snap-fit bearing holders in Greg Frosts's x carriage for the same reason why jonaskuehling made the slim LM8UU holder derivate. So I modified Greg's carriage and integrated the new bearing holders for an easy-to-disassemble x carriage.\r\n\r\nI attached the OpenSCAD files including Greg's configuration for some variables and Jonas' lm8uu-holder. I tidied up the source code a bit, but there are still some unnecessary lines left over from greg's code. The code is not overly clean and parametric due to the lack of time.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 31.01.2012\r\n- Reattached Greg's fan mount to the carriage. I updated the OpenSCAD file and added another STL.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 03.02.2012\r\n- One linear bearing could not slide into its bracket since the fan mount was blocking the path. I cut away a little clearance.\r\nNot the smartest solution, but quick and functional."
