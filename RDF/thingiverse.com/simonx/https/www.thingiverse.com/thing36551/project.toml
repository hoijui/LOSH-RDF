function = "I designed and printed a suppressor (based loosely on k-baffles) for my air rifle.\r\nIt consists of 3 sections - a barrel section that just pushes tightly onto the end of the barrel, an end cap (I've provided 2 different end caps designs), and the k-baffle section - which you print multiple copies of, the more you add the quieter the result.\r\nThe sections all push together then can be glued in place. Because each section is small you can make quite a long suppressor regardless of the print volume of your printer."
