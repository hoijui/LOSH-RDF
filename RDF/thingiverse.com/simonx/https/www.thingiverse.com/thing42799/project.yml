function: "A simple S3 cradle with inter-changeable bottom parts, two for desktop use, another for attaching to a standard camera tripod.\r\n\r\nI've used the camera attachment a few times when I've run 'Lapse It' - a cool time lapse for Android. \r\n\r\nI've included a photo of my S3 on my small camera tripod, but it fits great on full sized tripods too.\r\n\r\n[UPDATE] I've design a new pyramid style base as the tripod seemed a little unstable at times. The new base has a lower centre of gravity and is much more stable."
