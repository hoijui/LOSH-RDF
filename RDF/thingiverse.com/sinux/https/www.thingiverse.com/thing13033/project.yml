function: "I was looking for an accessory to mount a microphone on my camera. I choose to use the standard mounting platform for camera and simply add a screw (buy anywhere).\r\n\r\nTo have a good precision for mounting it and have simple part to print, I think it's better to thermoforming it rather than build a complex shape layer by layer.\r\n\r\nI needed it for a microphone but it can be used for others accessories..."
