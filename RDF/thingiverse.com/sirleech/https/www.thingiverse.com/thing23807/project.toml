function = "Aquarium for fish breeding, specifically marine clownfish pairs. Less of a \"home\" tank but more for science and aquaculture. \r\n\r\nIt's meant to be connected to a sump for filtration.\r\n\r\nUpdate 25 May, 2012- Added weir variation for 6mm acrylic to this tank artwork. Cut it all at once!\r\n\r\nGoes great with the laser-cut acrylic weir:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23808"
