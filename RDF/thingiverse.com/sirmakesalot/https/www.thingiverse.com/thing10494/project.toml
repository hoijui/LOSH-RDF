function = "This is my first contribution of my own design to Thingiverse! I designed it in Rhino and printed it on my TOM.  I left a lot of space in the piston cavity and it could probably be tweaked but it works great! Makes a good demo for children or if your bored give it a whirl! Big thanks to my friends at Makerbot support, Matt made this possible!"
