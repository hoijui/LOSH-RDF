function = "Like my single cylinder motor? Well here is a four cylinder demonstration model. I like to make mechanical things and this was something I wanted to model in 3d. The printable v8 is on the way!\r\n\r\nIt was brought to my attention that the STL files weren't all they could be so I have fixed them, no more Skieinforge errors!\r\n\r\nI have added a larger set of pistons but it requires really good settings."
