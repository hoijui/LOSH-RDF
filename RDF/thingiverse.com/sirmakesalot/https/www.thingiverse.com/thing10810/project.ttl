    okh:function """Here is a motor with a v8 configuration. It is two halves mounted ninety degrees from each other with the same crank shaft, connectors and pistons as the four cylinder just more of them. It is worth noting that they can be alternatively mounted flat or opposing piston configuration. I opted for the muscle of the V8! \r
\r
I have added the crank shaft parts layout and the source file as separate files so if any parts brake, you don't have to print the whole thing again!\r
\r
UPDATE: I have uploaded the fixed STL files, no more errors from Skeinforge! Thank you all for your valuable input as I am still learning too.\r
\r
I have added a larger piston file but it requires good printer settings.""" ;
