function: I was inspired by the texture of meteors and was playing around with pure forms, namely a cube and some spheres, and came up with these designs. More a sculptural object but interesting never the less. A challenge to print due to the circular overhangs. The first one I extracted the spheres at random and it works ok but learning from that I tried to eliminate as many as I could with the second design and it prints a little better.
