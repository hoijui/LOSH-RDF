function = "Someone said V-12 and I heard you! This one is very simmilar to my V-8 but with the addition of a modular section that allows you to make any size; want a V-24? no problem, want a V-6 ? You got it! Perhaps something strange like an in line-8 or 6...weird! Motor on demand!\r\n\r\nThere is a complete single tray file for those who have the printer footprint for it other wise single part types per tray for colour printing and I have added the source file so you can play, enjoy!\r\n\r\nI am printing one today (started 11:30 am Sunday) I will have pictures tonight!  \r\n\r\nAll done! 7.5-8 hours of printing time and 15-20 minutes to assemble.\r\n\r\nUPDATE I have added a larger piston. It should fit a bit tighter but requires good settings."
