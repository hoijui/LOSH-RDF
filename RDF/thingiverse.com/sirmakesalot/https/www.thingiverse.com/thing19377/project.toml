It reminded me of burnt out buildings so I built a post skynet city. LA, NY? Could be! Now you can commemorate where you were the day the machines took over and use up your support materials at the same time!\r\n\r\n(I used the downloaded file from Landru as Thingiverse wanted a file that is not an image. I have given ancestry to this thing but if I am out of line please let me know.)"
