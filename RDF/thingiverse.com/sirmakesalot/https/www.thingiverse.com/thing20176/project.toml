function = "This is a stepper stool I made for my furniture lab at school. I made the top and base from Ash and the uprights are Mahogany. I mainly used a table saw and router. It has a semigloss clear coat. \r\nI thought it would be fun to print them out and see it as a miniature or a study for a client."
