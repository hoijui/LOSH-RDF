function: "This is a model of a rotary-vee motor. A very unusual motor configuration with little practical application, according to NASA. This is a demonstration model that  was brought to my attention on a post by thingiuser jamesdavid on my v-12 motor. \r\nHere is the link he posted: \r\n\r\nhttp://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890016636_1989016636.pdf"
