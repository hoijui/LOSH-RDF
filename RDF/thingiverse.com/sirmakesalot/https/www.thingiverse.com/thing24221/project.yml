function: "Originally designed by Jens Risom, who designed the first chair for Knoll, this chair known as the Risom side chair was assigned to me in a CAD class to model in Rhino. \r\nI went and took a few pictures and some measurements of one then made my model. The chair is supposed to have webbing but my skill level wasn't up to it. I think it is my learning curve not the limits of Rhino."
