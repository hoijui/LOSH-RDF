function = "This is a project I made for school. We were asked to bring a piece of furniture into class from the garbage and dissect it, realize the construction method then rebuild it into a piece of sculpture. This was to be the basis for our final design. \r\nI found a chair in my back yard that had been there for several years. I thought it was like a soldier shipped off to war then upon returning is discarded because it is \"broken.\" I gave the chair a crystal clear acrylic leg to signify an injury. \r\nTaking the essence of the wounded chair I then decided to design a chair that was born without one leg. I did the math to ensure it could still stand and began construction. \r\nThe dark coloured chair is a Stephan chair from IKEA and was featured in a publication for first generation students and was also featured at the show for the launch of the book. \r\nThe Ash chair is 100% my design. It was featured in a year end retrospective show at the school and now proudly sits in my living room as a fully functional piece of furniture and a great conversation piece.\r\nIt was my intention to bring further awareness of disabilities."
