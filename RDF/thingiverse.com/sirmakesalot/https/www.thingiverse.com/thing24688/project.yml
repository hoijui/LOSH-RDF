function: "Derived from letter forms, namely a section of a capitol G and S, this chair shows how form can be generated from letters into sculptural furniture forms. It was a project I did along with a classmate for school. \r\n The goal was to learn how to make things in Rhino, save them as an STL for printing, lay out pieces for laser cutting and milling setup. In the end we had produced 3 models, one for each process. \r\n See the photos for the finished pieces."
