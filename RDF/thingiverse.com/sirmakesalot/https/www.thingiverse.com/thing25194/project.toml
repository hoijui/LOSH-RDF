function = "This is a model of a ring I am proposing for a jewelry class we must have a minimum of 3 solders. I thought the bent I-beam from a building would lend itself well to the jewelry world, an interesting narrative of things that are relatively unseen but contain some complex physics. I-beams could never bend this way of course so I thought that would be interesting.\r\n\r\nWINNER! \r\nThis is the one! I will be making it from sterling and copper. My professor enjoyed the narrative I am suggesting and the blend of materials and the way I am using them. He went on to say that the devil is in the details. Solder and polishing are my primary concerns so I may adjust the sizing accordingly. I will be finished with photos buy July 11 so check back then!"
