function: This is a model of a ring I am proposing for a jewelry class we must have a minimum of 3 solders. Inspired by architecture this ring as a simple construction of two rings with notches for the neighbouring fingers and four posts that pierce through and reveal themselves on the top and bottom. this ring could be made solder free with a riveting technique instead of solder.
