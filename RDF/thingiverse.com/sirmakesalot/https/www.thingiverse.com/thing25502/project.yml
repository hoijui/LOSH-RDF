function: "This is a clip-on boat accessory for those lazy fishing trips, for hunting down river monsters or just on a booze cruz!\r\n  It has a lure bar to hold hooks and lures, a cup or beverage holder that has a catch for holding cans specifically and there is also a sturdy rod holder. The rod holder has adjustable length and angle. The cup and rod holder would have some Sugru to cushion and grip your gear and help dampen vibrations so your beverage stays frosty and full of suds!\r\nThe caddy fits on the rail of a Princecraft 16 foot aluminum boat I use for fishing, fire wood collection, etc. The boat didn't come with any type of holder for anything. It has a small box you can open when the driver isn't sitting on it so I thought this would help with some hands free operations.\r\n  I am going to make some modular derivatives so keep watch!"
