"Oh Sirmakesalot! What will you come up with next? You and your Maker contraption!! Ha ha!"\r
\r
  First I have to say I never and I mean NEVER, wear a neck tie so I thought if I was to wear one what would it look like? It would have to reflect me and be friggin' cool!\r
  I have discovered a few attributes of my personality that have been very consistent through my creative ventures over the years. In particular is mechanization as a style. I love mechanical things. So as I was modelling my hollow universal joint for cable management, I thought this would lend itself well to the neck tie of my dreams!\r
   I figure it will take around 14 hours printing time so dedication is a virtue on this one!""" ;
