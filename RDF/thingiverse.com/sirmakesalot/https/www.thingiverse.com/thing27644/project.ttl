 chug, chug, chug, VROOOM, chug, chug, chug, Squeeeeealll!!!\r
 A larger version of my v8 motor, designed with the Replicator in mind.\r
The body is 225mm long so it should just fit the HBP of a Replicator. The pistons are 43mm (BIG, that's like a 50cc chainsaw motor!) and they connect with printed cylinders instead of filament. I also made all the moving parts with much tighter tolerances (.25+/-mm) so it requires a fairly fine tuned machine. I have also included smaller pistons in case they need to be smaller. I tried to keep the plastic needed to a minimum by designing it with thinner walls, radius edges and relief details but still be well detailed and robust. This also will help keep the print time to a minimum.""" ;
