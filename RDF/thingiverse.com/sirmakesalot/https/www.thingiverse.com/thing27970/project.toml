function = "I had a situation with my spools getting jammed after some filament fell off and became wrapped around the spool hangers on my Replicator. I designed these filament guides to hold the tubes in a better position. The photos show what happened and how these parts fit to help eliminate the chance of it happening again by accepting the filament from the middle of the spool.\r\nIf you have experienced the same thing then these are the parts you need!"
