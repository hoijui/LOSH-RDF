function: "This is to commemorate one of the single most greatest days I have had in a while. The day they filmed the Robocop remake in my back yard...literally! I have added a couple of photos of him on his bike out in front of my house here in Toronto. The filming took place in the lane that runs behind my house but I was surrounded by Robo-mania!\r\nsee more pictures on my blog!!\r\nhttp://gregmcroberts.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/robocop-remake-in-my-backyard/"
