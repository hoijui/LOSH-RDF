function: This is a simple bracket to put my printed 'saber on the wall. I used one inch acrylic rod for the blade but it works with the Force FX 'sabers from Hasbro or Master Replicas as well. It has a section for an LED and two button cell batteries to help light up the piercing. Though this is a work in progress the bracket is still usable as you can see in the pictures. I am making a couple of decorative caps (coming shortly) to cover the top and sides, hence it is a functional work in progress.
