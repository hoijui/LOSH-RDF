function = "This is a printable X-Axis flag for my Fleming CNC Isaac. It will only work if you are using Adrian's Geared extruder driver as well. It is the first thing I have printed that I designed myself. It is the second functional thing I designed in openscad. The file is not easily parametric (no variables). \r\n\r\nI am going to be posting my Z and Y brackets/flags for Isaac as well."
