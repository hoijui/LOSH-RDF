function = "This is the first thing I ever designed in Openscad. It is intended to be a Y bar/studding clamp for Huxley or Mendel. I parameterized it to hold 608 bearings for my filament spool. It is easily workable for people that are still getting a feeling for slicing software (me :p). \r\n\r\nSince I have the attention span of a squirrel, I declared a bunch of variables and ended up using them for other things than their name indicates. The equations are right, just some of the parameters are messed up. It is easy to figure out what does what."
