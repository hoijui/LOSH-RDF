function: "My teacher for AP calculus was giving out extra credit if we wore a math function the whole day in school. He got the idea from the English department, who does it with a red \"A\" when they read \"The Scarlet Letter\". \r\n\r\nSo anyway, two days before it was due I modeled this up. The night before, I set it to print, and wake up to the sound of steppers skipping. Sure enough it had warped off the build platform because it was so big! The center of the model stuck, but the nozzle got caught on one of the corners and the X and Y were skipping. \r\n\r\nI ended up just taking the bit of the model that was left and wrote the function with sharpie. He still gave me the credit :). Once I can get a driver board for my heated bed built I will attempt this one again."
