function: I found out while printing these vertexes that you need to flip the triangles sides on two of them to get them to work. The openscad file was modified to allow for this. Thanks to whosawhatasis for the great design/idea. This is going to be part of my "mixtape mendel" which is based of of prusajr's, hacklab.to's and whosaswhatasis's work.
