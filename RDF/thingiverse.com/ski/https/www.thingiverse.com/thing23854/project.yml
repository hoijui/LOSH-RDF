function: "**Update:** Basic tweaks and Customizer option here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2418507 \r\n\r\nThis is a durable, clamping Bicycle Light Mount.  Printed in ABS, this version has endured over 1,000 miles of pedaling along with the consequential jars, drops, crashes, etc. \r\n\r\nEasily adjust the aim of your light.  This design is meant to hang underneath the center portion of your handlebars so it's out of the way."
