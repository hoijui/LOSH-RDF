\r
    And then, for one day, you get to dress as that person without anyone mocking you.\r
\r
This year I looked at my Halloween preparations and found something missing,\r
\r
 MINIONS!!! \r
\r
How Can Anyone Be Respected Without MINIONS!!!  \r
\r
Rise My Little Spider Pumpkins!\r
\r
Bring Your Terror Upon The World With Dopey Glowing Eyes Of Doom!\r
\r
\r
\r
But I have so little time, and there is so much world. There is only one way.\r
\r
I must harness the power of Amateur Distributed Manufacturing to quickly spread my Minions to the farthest corners of the globe!\r
\r
  I Call Upon You My Brothers and Sisters of 3d Printing!  Make a Spider Pumpkin Of DOOM!  \r
\r
And Release It Upon The Unsuspecting World!""" ;
