function: "Halloween is that one magical time of year when each individual looks deep into there own phychi and finds the person they really wish they were. \r\n\r\n    And then, for one day, you get to dress as that person without anyone mocking you.\r\n\r\nThis year I looked at my Halloween preparations and found something missing,\r\n\r\n MINIONS!!! \r\n\r\nHow Can Anyone Be Respected Without MINIONS!!!  \r\n\r\nRise My Little Spider Pumpkins!\r\n\r\nBring Your Terror Upon The World With Dopey Glowing Eyes Of Doom!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I have so little time, and there is so much world. There is only one way.\r\n\r\nI must harness the power of Amateur Distributed Manufacturing to quickly spread my Minions to the farthest corners of the globe!\r\n\r\n  I Call Upon You My Brothers and Sisters of 3d Printing!  Make a Spider Pumpkin Of DOOM!  \r\n\r\nAnd Release It Upon The Unsuspecting World!"
