DISCLAIMER: We would like to emphasize that we do not take any responsibility for loss of warranties or broken products as a result of removing and replacing covers and shells. Different 3d printing technologies, software settings, and build setups, may produce differences in dimensions, which could in turn result in snap hooks damaging exposed electronics. We broke two readers ourselves, one with a too long snap hook, and one when forgetting to remove broken hooks from an earlier test. Please don't hesitate to leave questions in the comment field and we'll try to answer them as good as possible!""" ;
