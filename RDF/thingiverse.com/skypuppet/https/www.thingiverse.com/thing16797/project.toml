function = "This is a moderately larger 3d printer based on the ever popular Mendel, Prusa.\r\n\r\nThe build envelope in mm is 300,250,150 (x,y,z respectively).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of subtle differences in this design that I made to suit my own needs. For instance; the \r\nX-ends are interchangable and lock onto the smooth rods from the sides to prevent splitting along layers.\r\nAnd the A-side threaded diagonal rods are outside of the front and rear cross rods for better clearance \r\nwith the extruder at high z-limit. I reconfigured the vertexes to make that possible."
