    okh:function """I was frustrated with a previous creeper model I had because the pupils were in the wrong place. I decided to make a new one in OpenSCAD. This creeper is almost 100% anatomically accurate, with only a few almost invisible modifications to make OpenSCAD able to export the STL. While I was at it, I decided heck, why not make it customizable? You can customize the pixel size in mm, default is one.  \r
This might also make a good test print because it is just a couple boxes and it is in exact millimeter measurements.  \r
\r
If you like minecraft, you should check out [my youtube channel.](http://www.youtube.com/darkfangsii)  \r
\r
Use the customizer to get a dualstrusion version.""" ;
