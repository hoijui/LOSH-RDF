function = "My first design, created via Autodesk Inventor Fusion. This is a pencil holder for my desk, default print is 6.5\" wide, 3.5\" tall, and includes 3 slots, and a wide cup, as well as a spot for paper clips on the front.\r\n\r\nThis does the job, but after printing it, I already found some improvements to make, and there will be a v2 coming."
