function: "**Who wants to be a Trillionaire?**  \n---------------------------------------  \n\n*UPDATE 2/20/2015: I really want to put an embossing of President Obama on the blank side (for obviously ironic purposes), but I can't seem to find a good mesh that can be flattened. Anyone with the skills to remix this? I can provide the original Autodesk Inventor file...*  \n\nThere's a showdown over the US National debt ceiling about to take place, and one of the supposed methods of getting around it was this idea of a trillion dollar platinum coin. I figured that a piece of currency worth $1,000,000,000,000 should have a nice design, so I decided to make one. This current design is a \"platinum\" coin 3 inches in diameter, with the White House on the tail side, and TBD on the back. Note that this is not meant to be a political statement as much as it is a work of experimental art.  \n\nThis was an experiment to test the limits of my Replicator's ability to print surfacing embossing; in the default size, the letters on the face are extruded 0.02 in from the surface. It came out decently in default medium quality, so I'll finish this later when I have time."
