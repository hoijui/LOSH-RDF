function = "Place this target on the other side of your ping pong table and aim your serves at it. If you print two or more targets, you can practice hitting serves to different targets. You can place four small rubber feet on the bottom to prevent slippage when many balls hit the target. Use light-colored filament for the best contrast with your ping pong table. The targets should help improve the placement of your serves during practice."
