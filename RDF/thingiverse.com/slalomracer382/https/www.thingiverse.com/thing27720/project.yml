function: This is a mod to the existing Y Bar Ends on the Printrbot that allows you to adjust each of the four corners of your heated bed with the easy adjustment of only 4 screws. It allows for you to adjust the bed height on all four corners within thousandths of an inch to the tip of your extruder. The nice thing is there is no printing involved as it utilizes the existing print bed mounts.This mod also utilizes extra hardware from the Printrbot so there is no need to buy any parts except for two small springs.
