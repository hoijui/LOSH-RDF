    okh:function """The brackets are designed to allow you to easily adjust each corners of your print bed.\r
\r
This part is design to be a fastening bracket for a heated bed attached to a long bolt. A spring is to be used to push the heated bed up. The bracket allows free movement of the bolt unless the fastening bolt is tightened.\r
\r
I have successfully used this in a few printers already. It eliminates the need to "guess" that you have the right "feel" of a thin material.\r
\r
Make sure that your slicer includes an initial  1 layer height on print start.\r
\r
The provided STL uses the following parameters:\r
\r
boltDiameter = 3.9;\r
bracketDiameter = 15;\r
bracketHeight = 6;\r
nutHeight = 2.4;\r
nutDiameter = 5.6;\r
plateHeight = 3.5;\r
\r
The bolt Diameter should NOT match y our bolt diameter, it should be larger so the bolt doesn't snag too much.\r
\r
NOTE: This device requires your print head to push against the print bed. Make sure the fasteners are undone before calibrating and that your springs are not too strong as to damage your print head.""" ;
