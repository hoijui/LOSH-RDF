function: "Mattraptions' Luxo Jr. has stls that aren't ready to print. This 'derivative' is for people that use software that doesn't automatically place parts.\r\n\r\nI have rotated and centred each part so they can be printed without messing about.\r\n\r\nI would like to do a modification that already includes holes in parts.\r\n\r\nI haven't printed using these STL files just yet but they should be positioned correctly."
