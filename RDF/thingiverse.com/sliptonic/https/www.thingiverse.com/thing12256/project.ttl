 I'm not sure what I'll do with it, but it seems like it would work nicely in some kind of Halloween costume.\r
\r
The main bracket works like a clip-on spray-paint trigger -- In fact, the bracket should fit other kinds of rattle cans as well.\r
\r
The servo bracket was modeled to fit a hobby servo I had lying around.  I've found that servos have a variety of different mounting screw patterns so you might have to modify this for whatever servo you're using.\r
\r
A bent bit of paperclip works to connect the servo horn to the end of the trigger.\r

I just learned that this design is used in the [Icarus One](http://www.icarusone.com/yours/) spray paint drone by the artist/vandal [KATSU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KATSU).""" ;
