function = "Scout is a printable tribot designed for teaching the Boy Scout robotics merit badge.  http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges/mb-ROBO.aspx\r\n\r\nI've marked this as a derivative of MiniSkyBot because I was inspired by it and because Scout still uses the wheels from that project.  \r\n\r\nThe frame itself is a complete redesign with similar but different goals.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\nProvide a kit that meets the merit badge requirements with parts totaling < $50 USD.\r\n\r\n-Minimum printed parts\r\n-Minimum vitamins\r\n-Accommodate an arduino diecimila or nano.\r\n-use a 9V battery.\r\n-Flexible enough to allow boys to improve and extend the design.\r\n\r\nThe frame is a single printed piece.  The tabs for holding the servo motors can be tapped with a 4mm tap to avoid the need for nuts.\r\n\r\nThe top holes can be tapped with a 3mm tap to screw on an arduino without nuts.\r\n\r\nThe bracket will hold a 9v battery with just friction.  The rear battery bracket has a friction fit cup for a ball bearing caster.\r\n\r\nLarge holes in the bracket minimize the amount of plastic needed and allow wires to be routed up to the arduino.\r\n\r\nCost\r\nSince affordability was a major consideration, here's a run down of the final project cost.  \r\n\r\nThe plastic cost is just the cost of a roll divided by the number of kits we built.  There was lots of plastic left over and the boys are using it to design improvements.\r\n\r\nFrame & Wheels\t$7.86  (plastic from Makerbot)\r\nTires (2)\t$2.36  (Hardware store o-rings)\r\n4mm bolts (4)\t$0.84\r\nwheels screws (4)\t$0.96\r\nServos futaba (2)\t$8.38  (purchased new in bulk on ebay)\r\nArduino Nano\t\t$18.99 (purchased new on ebay)\r\nUltrasonic\t$3.90  (purchased new on ebay)\r\n9v connector\t$0.81  (Radio Shack)\r\nDC power plug\t$1.86  (Radio Shack)\r\n9V battery      $1.25  \r\n\t\tTotal:\t$47.21"
