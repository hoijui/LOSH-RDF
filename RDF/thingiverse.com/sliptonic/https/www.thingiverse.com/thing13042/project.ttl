    okh:function """Scout is a printable tribot designed for teaching the Boy Scout robotics merit badge.  http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges/mb-ROBO.aspx\r
\r
I've marked this as a derivative of MiniSkyBot because I was inspired by it and because Scout still uses the wheels from that project.  \r
\r
The frame itself is a complete redesign with similar but different goals.\r
\r
Goals:\r
Provide a kit that meets the merit badge requirements with parts totaling < $50 USD.\r
\r
-Minimum printed parts\r
-Minimum vitamins\r
-Accommodate an arduino diecimila or nano.\r
-use a 9V battery.\r
-Flexible enough to allow boys to improve and extend the design.\r
\r
The frame is a single printed piece.  The tabs for holding the servo motors can be tapped with a 4mm tap to avoid the need for nuts.\r
\r
The top holes can be tapped with a 3mm tap to screw on an arduino without nuts.\r
\r
The bracket will hold a 9v battery with just friction.  The rear battery bracket has a friction fit cup for a ball bearing caster.\r
\r
Large holes in the bracket minimize the amount of plastic needed and allow wires to be routed up to the arduino.\r
\r
Cost\r
Since affordability was a major consideration, here's a run down of the final project cost.  \r
\r
The plastic cost is just the cost of a roll divided by the number of kits we built.  There was lots of plastic left over and the boys are using it to design improvements.\r
\r
Frame & Wheels	$7.86  (plastic from Makerbot)\r
Tires (2)	$2.36  (Hardware store o-rings)\r
4mm bolts (4)	$0.84\r
wheels screws (4)	$0.96\r
Servos futaba (2)	$8.38  (purchased new in bulk on ebay)\r
Arduino Nano		$18.99 (purchased new on ebay)\r
Ultrasonic	$3.90  (purchased new on ebay)\r
9v connector	$0.81  (Radio Shack)\r
DC power plug	$1.86  (Radio Shack)\r
9V battery      $1.25  \r
		Total:	$47.21""" ;
