function: "This is a small ball caster to be used on robots or other things that need to roll.\r\n\r\nThe openscad file is set up to easily tweak values for commonly changed parameters:\r\n\r\nBall Diameter\r\nAirgap - How much play between the ball and the wall\r\nBall protrusion - How much the ball should stick out of the housing.\r\nTotal Height.\r\nBase thickness.  \r\nMounting screw radius.\r\nSpread between the mounting screws.\r\n\r\nI've started playing with a parameter to switch between two different mounting types.  This isn't done yet which is why the part is marked as a work-in-progress.\r\n\r\nEars will create a part as shown in the picture.  Meant to be mounted with two external screws.\r\n\r\nCenter Screw would have a counter sunk screw in the center of the main cylinder.  The caster could then be screwed in before the ball is snapped into place.\r\n\r\nMy reprap isn't particularly well tuned but the ball spins freely.\r\n\r\nI'm incorporating this design directly into scout. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13042"
