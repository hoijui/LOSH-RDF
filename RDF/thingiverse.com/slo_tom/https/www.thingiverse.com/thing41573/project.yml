function: "This thing is my first attempt at modeling. I don't have a printer yet, but my kit should be here any day now. I have not printed this thing.\r\n\r\nThis thing is supposed to be a stackable spice rack for my kitchen. The compartments are sized to fit round spice bottles about 50mm in diameter. It is intended to hold the bottles lying down, with all of the lids facing front for easy spice identification.\r\n\r\nEdit 1/10/2013:\r\nCrap. I think I made this thing bigger than the print bed on the Printrbot+. \r\n\r\nEdit 1/10/2013:\r\nRevised the shape to fit in the 200mm X 200mm print bed of the Printrbot+. Tried to make hex2.stl modular/stackable. I am working on a few different shapes that actually lock together.\r\n\r\nEdit 1/11/2013:\r\nAdding a few other shapes that should interlock together.\r\n\r\nEdit 2/18/2013:\r\nOk. I finally got my printer up and working. Tried printing a couple of the shapes. They slice fine, but take a rediculously long time to print, on the order of 6 to 8 hours. I think it is due partly to my infill settings and the small spaces between perimeters. Also found out that I didn't leave enough clearance around the interface areas between interlocking parts. They don't really fit together that well, or at all. I'll try adjusting the shapes when I have time."
