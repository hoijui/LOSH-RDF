function = "This is a bracket to mount Ultibots' fan duct (or AeroMonkeyDork's derivative fan duct) to a laser cut Printrbot Plus extruder mount.\r\n\r\nEdit 3/22/2013:\r\nI printed and fitted the bracket and fan to my bot. There are 2 issues. First, the 40mm fan that I have doesn't move much air, only 4.1cfm. This does not provide enough cooling. Second, the bracket arm is too long and the duct ends up at a funny angle too high above the extruder nozzle. \r\n\r\nSolutions are to install a fan that moves more air, and to shorten the arm or provide another joint in the arm."
