In fact, I am nearly sure no one else needs this. But I post it because my father who does not own a 3d-printer searched a very long time for a part like this and tried several ways to replace it himself. The fact that I needed 15 minutes to model it in sketchup and the print turned out to work ten times as well as the original, convinced him that 3d printers really are not stupid :p" ;
