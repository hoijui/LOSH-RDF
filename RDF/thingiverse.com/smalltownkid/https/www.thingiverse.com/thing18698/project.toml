function = "This is a derivative of Physics_Dude's awesome Tool holder. The original can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14496\r\n\r\nI redesigned the part in Tinkercad to remove the single large hole for the X-Acto knife and replaced it with 3 smaller holes to hold additional Hex keys. I removed the X-Acto knife hole because the one I have has a large bulky handle on it and would not fit in to the original.   \r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad.
