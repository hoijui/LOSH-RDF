\r
Why make one? For this Christmas I have been stuck as to what to buy my Father. He is into boats and sailing so I thought I would give him some money. Rather then be boring I will make it a challenge to get to it :)\r
\r
If anyone is interested here is the riddle I made for it:\r
\r
My first is in Santa and also in Man,\r
My second's in Star and also in Plan,\r
\r
My third is in Give but not in Tree,\r
My forth in Awake and also Beardy,\r
\r
My fifth is in Sleigh and also in Lights,\r
I will defend you in freshly pressed whites.\r
\r
What am I?\r
\r
Hmmm, how about a database of riddles? LOL\r

The yellow, orange, red and purple are from Faberdashery. The black and clear from Mendel Parts.""" ;
