function: "Have updated my Codex to make it a little tighter as the last one was a little loose.\r\n\r\nWhy make one? For this Christmas I have been stuck as to what to buy my Father. He is into boats and sailing so I thought I would give him some money. Rather then be boring I will make it a challenge to get to it :)\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested here is the riddle I made for it:\r\n\r\nMy first is in Santa and also in Man,\r\nMy second's in Star and also in Plan,\r\n\r\nMy third is in Give but not in Tree,\r\nMy forth in Awake and also Beardy,\r\n\r\nMy fifth is in Sleigh and also in Lights,\r\nI will defend you in freshly pressed whites.\r\n\r\nWhat am I?\r\n\r\nHmmm, how about a database of riddles? LOL\r\n\r\nThe yellow, orange, red and purple are from Faberdashery. The black and clear from Mendel Parts."
