*30/05/2013*  
Had issues with the home made keypad so make this second front panel (Top Half V2) which takes the Numeric Keypad from Maplin (http://www.maplin.co.uk/numeric-press-button-keypad-220344). It interfaces with the alarm the same way. Also I had issues with the LED's which stood off of the PCB. They broke the tracks so I also moved them to the side of the box to be better seen through the shed door's window.  

A friend of mine wanted to have an alarm on his shed/garage. He had brought one but it failed to work correctly after about a year.  

He then asked me if I would be able to create him a simple little system to help protect his stuff. This is the result of that request.  

It has two circuits, one for PIRs and another for door switches. Run by a 4 digit code to turn the alarm on and off, internal and external sounders/alarms.  

In the picture the base of the case is two tone, this was due to me running out of filament through the print and inserting a new (different colour) filament while it was still printing. It is only meant to be printed one colour, no dualstruder needed!""" ;
