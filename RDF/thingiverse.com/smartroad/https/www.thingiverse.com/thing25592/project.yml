function: "*** Check out the new iteration here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:69265 ***\r\n\r\nI have been looking for a way of storing my electronic components without having to have a massive rack to store 10 resistors!\r\n\r\nThingiverse is filled with storage options however most used much more filament then I wanted, as they often have thick walls.\r\n\r\nMy solution has only 1mm thick walls, this cuts out the need for any infill."
