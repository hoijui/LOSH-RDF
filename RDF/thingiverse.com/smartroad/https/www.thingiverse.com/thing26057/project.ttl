\r
This is the result of that suggestion!\r
\r
I have yet to print it (printer is currently occupied!) so it is simply based on measurements of my Nano. Once it is printed any adjustments will then be put onto here.\r
\r
All the buttons and ports should still be usable to allow for normal use still.""" ;
