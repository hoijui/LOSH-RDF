function: "A friend saw me with my iPod Nano in a watchstrap case and suggested that I could make it into a pocket watch.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of that suggestion!\r\n\r\nI have yet to print it (printer is currently occupied!) so it is simply based on measurements of my Nano. Once it is printed any adjustments will then be put onto here.\r\n\r\nAll the buttons and ports should still be usable to allow for normal use still."
