function: "#Introduction:  \nThis is a mounting bracket for the Scanguage.  The concept is based off using the rear view mirror as support. This allows you to place the Scanguage above or below the rear view mirror.  \n\nI designed this to solve two problems.  The first one is if you mount the Scanguage on top of the dash you may get a reflection in the windshield, especially at night.  Also I found that the backlight was too much at night.  The second issue was that neither velcro nor command strips were able to keep this rather light device put. In both cases the device was coming off the fasten (velcro/command strips).   \n\n#Benefits:  \nBy moving the Scanguage next to the rear view mirror:  \nThe Scanguage is still easily visible while diving  \nThe backlight is no longer distracting at night  \nScanguage is out of sight of thieves  \n\n#Design:  \nThis is a multipart design.  The first part attaches to the rear view mirror stem (the part that connects the rear view mirror to the windshield).  This consists of two halves that bolt together around the stem.  This serves as the connecting point to the mirror.  The second part connects to the Scanguage.  This version is design to use the screws in the back of the Scanguage as the attaching point. This is achieved by removing the screws from the back of the Scanguage and replacing them with longer screws that pass through the mounting bracket.  This keeps the Scanguage in place.  A bolt connects the two pieces together and allow adjustment of the angle to accommodate different mirrors, viewing angles, and mirror adjustments.  \n\nAlso included is an extension arm in case more distance between the two parts are needed.  \n\n#Limitations:  \nThis currently is designed for mirrors with round stems (the arm connecting the mirror to the windshield).  There are some manufactures that do not use round stems for their rear view mirrors.  As is this bracket will not work with those mirrors.  \n\n#File Information:   \nIncluded is the stl files (*.stl) for printing.  Also included is the 123D design files (*.123dx) for those familiar with the free software from Autodesk and wish to tweak the design. Autodesk 123 Design is available at http://www.123dapp.com/design for Web, Windows, Mac, and iOS.   \n\n#Update:  \n21 March 2014:  Non-Substantive changes  \n2 Feb 2013:  Initial Upload  \n3 Feb 2013:  Added Scanguage II/Scanguage D bracket file.  \n11 May 2013:  Added Scanguage-e version with screw holes  \n\n#Warning:  \nYour attention should be on the road and you should have an unobstructed driving environment.  READ AND FOLLOW the warning on page 2 of the Scanguage Manual.  (http://www.scangauge.com/wp-content/uploads/documentation/sge-1-0/SGE_UM_101.pdf). This includes mounting the device and cable in a way that will not block your view or your ability to operate your car. When Installing this, make sure your rear view mirror is PROPERLY ADJUSTED and you have an UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW. I cannot be held responsible for a lack of common sense."
