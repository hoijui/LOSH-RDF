The nipples & divots for the axes were too small, so the concentric didn't stay together.  I changed the whosawhatsis' original OpenSCAD script to increase the size of both nipples & divots.  If anything, they are a bit too big however this is nothing an xacto knife couldn't take care of...\r
\r
The SCAD file is close, but not the exact one used to produce the STL. I once again forgot to save my updated file in OpenSCAD.""" ;
