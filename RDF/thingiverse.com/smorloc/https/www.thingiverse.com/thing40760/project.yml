function: "I tried many times to print thing:19304 (in PLA) however the outcomes were disappointing.  The nipples & divots for the axes were too small, so the concentric didn't stay together.  I changed the whosawhatsis' original OpenSCAD script to increase the size of both nipples & divots.  If anything, they are a bit too big however this is nothing an xacto knife couldn't take care of...\r\n\r\nThe SCAD file is close, but not the exact one used to produce the STL. I once again forgot to save my updated file in OpenSCAD."
