function = "From Wikipedia:\r\nThe Nefertiti Bust is a 3,300-year-old painted limestone bust of Nefertiti, the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten and one of the most copied works of ancient Egypt. Owing to the work, Nefertiti has become one of the most famous women of the ancient world, and an icon of feminine beauty. The work is believed to have been crafted in 1345 BC by the sculptor Thutmose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis model was found at: http://www.3dvia.com/models/2F87932537091B2D/nefertiti and converted to STL and made to have a flat base.\r\n\r\nIt is a fairly low resolution model.  I personally like the pronounced visible facets.  When printed hollow in a clear filament, the light plays off the facets beautifully."
