The Inextacto Hobby Knife Hanle is enitely generated in openSCAD, so you can tailor it to suit your particular needs...  Need it fatter?  No problem!  Want it in pink?  Easy!\r\n\r\nThe STLs in this thing are for the wider blades (~9mm).   I will soon be releasing a version for the narrower blades (~6mm) and one with a larger screwdriver-like handle.\r\n\r\nEnjoy..."
