function: If you have a pet hamster, you know that they like to run in their exercise wheel - a LOT, at NIGHT and often the wheel SQUEAKS.  Here is a design for a (hopefully) squeakless hamster wheel that uses a 608 bearing.  I don't (yet) have a 3-d printer, so no photos.  I made sure there were not non-manifold points.
