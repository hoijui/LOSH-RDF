Ultimately, I want to be able to scan trilobite fossils, enlarge then and print out models.  Here is my first attempt, cleaned up with MeshLab & Blender.  My printer is having technical issues, so I haven't printed it yet.  (I was able to generate nice looking gcode in repSnapper, now I just have to get my wood mendel fixed!)"
