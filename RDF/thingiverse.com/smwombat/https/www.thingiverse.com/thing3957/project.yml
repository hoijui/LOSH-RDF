function: I\'ve been playing around with the David Laser scanner http://www.david-laserscanner.com/wiki/(just using a cheap laser level from Lowe\'s).  Ultimately, I want to be able to scan trilobite fossils, enlarge then and print out models.  Here is my first attempt, cleaned up with MeshLab & Blender.  My printer is having technical issues, so I haven't printed it yet.  (I was able to generate nice looking gcode in repSnapper, now I just have to get my wood mendel fixed!)
