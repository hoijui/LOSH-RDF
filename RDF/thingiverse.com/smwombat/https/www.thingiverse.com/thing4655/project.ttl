    okh:function """A ceramic hamster was scanned using DAVID laser scanner (focusable line laser and Logitech webcam pro).  Resulting large mesh was decimated using Meshlab.  I added a flat bottom using Blender. Paws in smaller figure have a sharp overhang, which I tried to \\'fix\\' in Blender (large figure).  But, the curled paws look so much cuter... so that\\'s the version I posted here.  I also fixed the eyes on the large figure - they were not very visible in the decimated scan.\r

Both samples printed with Ultimachine white PLA, using Repsnapper.  The settings need a lot of work ....""" ;
