function: "Instead of giving my nephews some cash in an envelope (which is what they want) I decided to check out Thingiverse for some inspiration of something a bit more fun.  \r\nI found this cool locked box and decided to redraw it to make it bigger so I could stuff some cash in there. I also made it a tighter fit and a bit more rounded while I was at it.  \r\nThe name on the side is not included in the model I uploaded of course."
