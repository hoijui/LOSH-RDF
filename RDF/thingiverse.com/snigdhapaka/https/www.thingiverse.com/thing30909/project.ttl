Usually when you play a high school sport, at the end of the season, the team gives the coach a gift. As part of that gift, I wanted to make a plaque for our coach. I thought that it would be a very unique and personalized gift for her. As you can see, it reads RHS Girl's Tennis Coach, Coach Devin and has two tennis racquets on it." ;
