    okh:function "This \"poster\" is made out of acrylic and it is actually for my history teacher. We had to write an essay about our five most favorite Americans and then we had to define what it means to be an American. In my essay, I suggested that being American means that you are simply crazy. Crazy enough to fight for freedom, crazy enough to try (and might I add succeed) in building a working democratic nation, crazy enough to sacrifice our lives to help cure poverty in other countries. The things that Americans do are very crazy. Sometimes, our craziness isn't always good for example, like when we sacrifice our lives to stuff our ideas down the throats of countries who like their way of life. Sure, we have our faults but overall, we are a nation of crazy nice, crazy funny, crazy strange, crazy determined and just plain crazy people. With this idea in mind, I made this poster for my history teacher and in the future, I will make a frame for it. There are 50 stars on it for the 50 stars on our flag and 13 \"veins\" which represent the 13 stripes on our flag. You can actually put little pictures in the holes that surround the eagle too=)" ;
