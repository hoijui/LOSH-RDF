The quote is from the movie, The Pursuit of Happyness and it reads, \"Hey. Don't ever let somebody tell you... You can't do something. Not even me. All right?\" I figured that it would be pretty encouraging to have quotes like this on a bunch of ping pong balls. That way, if you are losing a ping pong match, you can just take a second to read the ping pong ball and boost your spirit=)" ;
