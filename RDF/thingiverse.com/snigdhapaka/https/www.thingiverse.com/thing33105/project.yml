function: This tower is a good tool for those of us who have an uncontrollabe sweet tooth. Personally, I have caught myself eating way to much candy before, during and after Halloween. To solve my candy problem, I made this candy holder. This holder has seven tiers, each of which correlates to the seven days in a week. So on Sunday of every week, you can fill every tier with as much candy as will fit on them. Then, on every day of the following week you can eat the candy that is in one of the tiers. That way, you can hopefully control the amount of candy you eat everyday!
