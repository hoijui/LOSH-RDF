function: I love art and I hate seeing my bedroom walls all empty so I decided to make an original piece of art to decorate them. I have always been inspired by elements so I wanted to make a medallion that had the four elements on it. I also wanted to include some of my favorite animals on the art piece so I included a lion, a wolf, an eagle and an elephant. I also wanted to have a frame so I added four squares that bordered the medallion and gave it an illusion of a frame.
