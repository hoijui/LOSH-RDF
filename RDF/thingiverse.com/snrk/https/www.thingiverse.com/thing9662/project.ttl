    okh:function """My son (see thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8845) lost my fathers key for the outdoor watering tap. I learned about it yesterday, and by chance, thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9636 had just been uploaded. However, I didn't like the handle in that design, because it didn't look at all like the original key. \r
\r
I therefore made my own adjustments to the file, so that the model looked a lot more like my imagination of the original part. I also added some embossed text ("Water" and "From Viktor") to the handle just to show off. Uploaded the model I gave away, and a clean one if you can keep the purpose of your keys in your head.\r
\r
SCAD-file is not parametric, but itÂ´s quiet obvious what to change if you have other dimensions than me.\r
\r
I know this is a kind of derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9636 , but I donÂ´t know how to make this apparent.""" ;
