function: "My son (see thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8845) lost my fathers key for the outdoor watering tap. I learned about it yesterday, and by chance, thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9636 had just been uploaded. However, I didn't like the handle in that design, because it didn't look at all like the original key. \r\n\r\nI therefore made my own adjustments to the file, so that the model looked a lot more like my imagination of the original part. I also added some embossed text (\"Water\" and \"From Viktor\") to the handle just to show off. Uploaded the model I gave away, and a clean one if you can keep the purpose of your keys in your head.\r\n\r\nSCAD-file is not parametric, but it\xC2\xB4s quiet obvious what to change if you have other dimensions than me.\r\n\r\nI know this is a kind of derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9636 , but I don\xC2\xB4t know how to make this apparent."
