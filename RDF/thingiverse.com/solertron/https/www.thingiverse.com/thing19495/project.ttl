I decided to use LM8UU linear bearings simply because I could not find the recommended nylon washers and although I tested some replacement options for the nylon bushings I could not help wanting to utilize linear bearings.  After trying a few options I settled for some LME8UUAJ Adjustable Ball Bushings. \r
I had this version laser cut to test the idea. 4 holes over each of the bearing holes were drilled (shown in the pic) and were tapped with 2mm threads for the grub screws to hold the linear bearings.\r
And another option for bearings...\r
I decided to try Spherical Bushings(GE-08.00x16.00W300) after noticing that the LM8 bearings were a little noisy.  The Spherical bushings are self aligning, which maeks the job of assembly/alignment very easy, and they are of course very quiet.  I hace included some extra photos for referecne.""" ;
