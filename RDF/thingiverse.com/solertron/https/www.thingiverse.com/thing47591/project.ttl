    okh:function """I designed this hinge specifically to hold an acrylic door that I designed for my 3D printer. The hinge fit and movement worked out very well. In fact better than I expected, so I am very pleased with the result.   
I have included the STL files for the final design which rely on the pin side being the support on the bottom so you can remove the door at will.  If you want the hinges to lock so the door will not be removable simply orient the pin side of the hinges opposite to each other. Drawing files are also supplied, and I now include a wider v2 for expanded choice.  Of course, you are welcome to modify the design.  Enjoy
