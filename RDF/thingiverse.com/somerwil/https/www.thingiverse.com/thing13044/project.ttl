    okh:function """This is an STL output of DAVID's laser scanner software. It's a spider toy from my sun's toybox. The spider is knitting his spider web.\r
\r
It's my first attempt to scan an object with the scanner and I'm pretty happy with this plug-'n-play output of the software. Everything I did was unboxing the starter's pack, install some software and drivers, start the program and start scanning. I think it's quiet amazing what I was able to get out of the program without even reading the instructions...\r
\r
I know I can get (much) more out of it but being the first scan I think it isn't bad at all.\r
\r
Please be aware that it's not a 100% good model yet. Orientation of the model is poor and it has no good flat bottom to place on the platform of a 3D printer. Please feel free to play around with it and give it a try.\r
\r
Opening the file in Netfabb didn't result in open faces/ holes/ other issues to be repaired by Netfabb so the model itself seems to be OK.\r
\r
Any help on the 'flat-bottoming' is welcome ;-)\r
\r
UPDATE: A flat bottomed spider is now available. Netfabb has some features to cut objects into pieces. Thanks to Floush.""" ;
