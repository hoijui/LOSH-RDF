function: "This is an STL output of DAVID's laser scanner software. It's a spider toy from my sun's toybox. The spider is knitting his spider web.\r\n\r\nIt's my first attempt to scan an object with the scanner and I'm pretty happy with this plug-'n-play output of the software. Everything I did was unboxing the starter's pack, install some software and drivers, start the program and start scanning. I think it's quiet amazing what I was able to get out of the program without even reading the instructions...\r\n\r\nI know I can get (much) more out of it but being the first scan I think it isn't bad at all.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that it's not a 100% good model yet. Orientation of the model is poor and it has no good flat bottom to place on the platform of a 3D printer. Please feel free to play around with it and give it a try.\r\n\r\nOpening the file in Netfabb didn't result in open faces/ holes/ other issues to be repaired by Netfabb so the model itself seems to be OK.\r\n\r\nAny help on the 'flat-bottoming' is welcome ;-)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: A flat bottomed spider is now available. Netfabb has some features to cut objects into pieces. Thanks to Floush."
