function: "Hi, everyone. I am a Industrial design student from China. This is my envision of the future personal transportation system.\r\nAt the core of this system is a car with two seats. It is two-wheeled and balanced by gyroscope and microcomputers on board. This design can greatly reduce turning mechanics and increase its agility.\r\nThrough the center under the car there is a slot. This slot serves as a positioning tool when the car gets on another platform. The car itself serves best as a regional, local transportation method. When you want to make a longer trip, you can drive the car directly to the train station. Buy a ticket through on board computer and then drive onto the train. You car will automatically fasten itself to the train and rotate forward. That's really easy!!\r\nThanks for visiting my project. Please feel free to tell me any idea you have in mind, I am happy to talk about it."
