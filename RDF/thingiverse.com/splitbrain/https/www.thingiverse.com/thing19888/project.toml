function = "This is an addition to richgain's simple but effective Fan Mount. It allows you to use a second fan on the x-motor side.\r\n\r\nI found having only a fan blowing from one side of the bed not enough certain prints and wanted a second on blowing from the opposite direction. By attaching the fan to the x-motor it moves with the z-axis and will always point towards the newest layer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design was made in Tinkercad and is available at https://tinkercad.com/things/1dSwoYOgJ0h"
