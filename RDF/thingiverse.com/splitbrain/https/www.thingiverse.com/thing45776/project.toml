function = "This is a simple holder for the Belkin 4-Port Ultra-Slim desktop Hub (Product Number F4U038). The holder can be screwed on somewhere and the Hub simply snaps in.\r\n\r\nUpdate (2013-01-10): I updated the holder to be 2mm higher and thus having a bit more grip than before. I also enlarged the mounting holes a bit."
