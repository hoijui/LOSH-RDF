function: "I have been looking at the X Axis mods on Thingiverse using the roller bearings and decided to take a different slant on the subject.\r\nI decided to try some linear ball race bushes as used on CNC engravers and routers.\r\nI managed to track down some 3/8 inch id bushes with an od of the exact size that fits the existing holes which are holding the plain bushes.\r\nThe X table now moves as if it is floating on air.\r\nAfter seeing this result I intend getting another two to put on my Y axis."
