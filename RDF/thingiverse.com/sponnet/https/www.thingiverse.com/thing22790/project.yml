function: "This is a replacement for the printrbot base. It will prevent both the Z axis and the Y axis stepper motors from bending outwards.\r\n\r\nThe bending problem is shown in the picture(s) below.\r\n\r\nThere is an alternative version available which integrates a support for attaching the Y-stop switch directly to the base.\r\n\r\n** update : uploaded a V2 of the stl with Y-stop. It contained a little error which gave a manifold error while slicing."
