function: "This is a minimalistic rod-mount for your printrbot electronics. Simply use 4 zipties to mount the board onto your M8 threaded rods. No screws needed.\r\n\r\nThe STL file is configured to fit onto the original Printrboard Electronics board ( http://printrbot.com/shop/printrboard-electronics/ ) but you can change the parameters in the scad file to attach other dimensions too....\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n- Uploaded a version 3 which has 2 extra holes to fit the Sanguinololu board too.\r\n- Uploaded a version 4 with larger holes, for better fitting and easier printing.."
