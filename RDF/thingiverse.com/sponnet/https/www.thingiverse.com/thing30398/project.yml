function: "This full plate contains all the 3D parts you need to build a new printrbot in one run.\r\n\r\nThis is Self Replication in its purest form !\r\n\r\nIt contains all the most recent versions of the base parts, some were replaced by enhanced versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Please note that this plate contains all parts to build the printrbot base. The extruder and all its accessories is on a seperate plate here : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30787\r\n** update 2012/12/18 : fixed a little manifold error , thanks to Pierre-Olivier Ceffis\r\n** removed the 10t pulleys from the plate. An aluminium pulley gives better print results.\r\n** update 2013/02/06 : ( V3 ) re-arranged the pieces so that pieces that tend to detach from the heatbed are pointing towards the center of the plate. It's hot & cosy there... The newest version also stays away from the corners of your build platform , to avoid bumping into clipses at the corners of your glass plate if you have one..."
