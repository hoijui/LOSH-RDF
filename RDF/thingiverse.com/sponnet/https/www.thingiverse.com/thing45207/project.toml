function = "An enhanced version of the Wallace 3D printer.  \nFeatures a more stable X-carriage construction which balances the extruder body over 2 horizontally mounted rods. It uses less screws & bolts than the original Wallace.  \nSome features :  \n* Y-mount.stl & y-bearing-guide.stl : An enhanced mount for centering the Y-axis belt. Gives you a more stable pull.  \n* X-end2-motor.stl + X-end2-idler.stl : new motor mounts, align the X-axis horizontally  \n* X-carriage.stl : carriage for the horizontal setup. Fits a wade extruder & any type of hotend, even the newer short JHead extruders...  \n* base_end_2off.stl : enhanced base - puts the linear bearings as far apart as possible to enhance the stability of the print bed.  \n* y_bearing_retainer_stopswitch.stl : bearing retainer including a ziptie stopswitch mount, for your Z-stopswitch.  \nUpdate 20130430 : New Y-mount & bearing-guide uploaded.   \nUpdate 20140809 : Removed obsolete parts"
