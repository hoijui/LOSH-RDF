function: "I made this in acrylic, cut on a laser cutter, to hold bushings for the Reprap Prusa I am building. The brass bushings have an interior diameter of 5/16\" and an exterior diameter of 0.439\", which is the same as the\r\ndiamater of the nearly circular hole in the center of this part. The part was drawn in Corel Draw, \r\nbased on information in the SCAD source file pla-bushing.scad. Basically, I only needed a cross-section of the Reprap part and so could ignore the Z dimension in the SCAD file. \r\n\r\nTwo of these cut in 1/4\" acrylic, stacked and glued together, are slightly bigger than the bushing they are designed to hold."
