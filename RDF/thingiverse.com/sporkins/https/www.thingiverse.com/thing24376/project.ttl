    okh:function """This is my first attempt at making anything printable, and a way to teach myself about Inventor.  It still needs some work, but I'm done wasting plastic on cups for a while.  \r
\r
This collapsible cup is about the size of a shot glass, when extended.  Its collapses down to less than 3/4" and expands to just over 1 1/2" tall.  \r
\r
It prints as one piece.  The outer layers have to be cleaned up on the bottom edge after printing. \r
\r
The handle is pretty weak, I think my next version will have a beefier handle.  \r
