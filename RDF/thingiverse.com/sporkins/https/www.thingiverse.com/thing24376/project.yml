function: "This is my first attempt at making anything printable, and a way to teach myself about Inventor.  It still needs some work, but I'm done wasting plastic on cups for a while.  \r\n\r\nThis collapsible cup is about the size of a shot glass, when extended.  Its collapses down to less than 3/4\" and expands to just over 1 1/2\" tall.  \r\n\r\nIt prints as one piece.  The outer layers have to be cleaned up on the bottom edge after printing. \r\n\r\nThe handle is pretty weak, I think my next version will have a beefier handle.  \r\n\r\nPrinted on a Replicator."
