function: "Have you ever wondered why they put the darn spool mounts on the back of the Replicator 2?  Have you ever wondered why the clips for the spools are so tight?  It's a nightmare to change the filament on these awesome machines, especially if they are on a shelf or desk with limited space. This clip-on quick-change front spool mount fixes all that!  It allows easy, quick, no fuss changes of the filament FROM THE FRONT without having to move the Replicator 2!\r\n\r\nYou're welcome."
