function: We recently bought a second-hand Quinny (tm) baby carrier on the cheap. Fortunately for me, a single plastic part was missing.. :-) So I decided to copy its mirror counterpart. It's not completely finished yet, but it works on our carrier, so I decided to upload the design. I'm planning on finishing it at some point.
