function: "You are a bavarian Hans or Gretel, living far away from your sweet home and have Heimweh for our famous bavarian Gemuetlichkeit?\r\n\r\nThen this might just be the product for you!\r\nThis traditional bavarian tablet for rolling traditional bavarian cigarettes is/can/will-be made of 100% pure ABS, with a dimension of 147x95x39mm, weighting in at about 65-75g (depending on line thickness and fill pattern).\r\n\r\nIt is compatible with all major brands of longpapers, rolls, and filtertips including the slim and wide variants of OCB and RAW.\r\n\r\nThe integrated grinder holder can be used with all grinders of up to 21mm in thickness and 21mm radius.\r\nYou don't own a grinder? No problem, you've just got yourself a nice mixing bowl (Mischeschale)! ;-)\r\n\r\nThe three filter tipp holes are 9, 7 and 5mm in diameter and may also be used as stands for traditional bavarian cigarettes or small pipes, e.g. the infamous SPP1 Titan pipe."
