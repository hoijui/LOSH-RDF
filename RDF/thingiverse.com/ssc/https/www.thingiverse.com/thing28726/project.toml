function = "A keyboard holder for the Galaxy Note and Hama/Brando bluetooth keyboards.\r\n\r\nThe holder can also be used as a stand in both horizontal and vertical orientation, when attaching the two T shaped parts to it.\r\n\r\nEasy to assemble and disassemble.\r\nFits into any pocket.\r\n\r\nIt's a way of turning your Galaxy Note into a tiny netbook and saving screen real estate at the same time. This is especially useful when combined with a classical linux userland, e.g. the Ubuntu app. Although just using it for IRC or Soup.io is probably fine too ;-)"
