function: "This design was inspired by theorbtwo's marker holder, except I wanted something open that didn't need to be fastened shut.  This part should help rapidly color a length of filament feed stock with a few swipes.\r\n\r\nThis is designed to take a fine point sharpie marker and paint a 3mm filament."
