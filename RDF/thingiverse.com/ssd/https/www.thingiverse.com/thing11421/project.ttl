This puzzle's design pulled from [the now defunct IBM research page](http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/BurrPuzzles/B6HB10.html).  It was categorized under General higher level burr puzzles.  This is a level 10 puzzle with a unique solution.  These pages are still available through internet archives, see the links at the end of the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_puzzle).  \r
\r
Note: I rotated piece 4 to turn an overhang into a bridge.  This built cleanly on my cupcake with minimal sagging at the default size 6.  \r
While I found the Philippe Dubois burr slightly challenging, I found this one much harder.  \r
I have uploaded the puzzle file for Burrtools, see [Burr Tools on sourceforge](http://burrtools.sourceforge.net/) which can animate assembly too.""" ;
