function = "This part was originally a medical model, but it has been cleaned, recleaned, mangled, hollowed, support added, and cleaned again. (Thanks everyone who has worked on this model!)  I'm sure by now, it has lost a great deal of its original anatomical accuracy, but it sure does look nice.\r\n\r\nEventually, it will print nice too...but this is still a work in progress.\r\n\r\nI've completed cleanup of the basic shape.\r\nI'm having problems with all of the parts that were drawn; I'm thinking that either they are too complex or not manifold in the first place, and meshlab is too simplistic to do anything but verify if the files are OK and reorient the faces.  I've been manually cleaning them up in blender, but it is slow."
