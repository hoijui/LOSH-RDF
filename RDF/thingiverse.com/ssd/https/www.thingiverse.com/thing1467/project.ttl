\r
These are two of the basic shapes in pyTopMod, except that it builds them edge down.  If there's a way to align faces in TopMod, I didn't find it.  I used blender to rotate them to be face down.  \r
\r
I also tried TopMod's soccer ball, but it has too much overhang and failed to build.\r
\r
The whistle is in the picture because I built the plain whistle http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1222 and built a 1cm icosahedron first and dropped it in during build.""" ;
