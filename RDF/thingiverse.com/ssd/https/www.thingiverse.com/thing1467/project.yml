function: "These are simple regular solids that are, well, solid.  They may actually use less material than the hollow dodecahedron at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:198 if you let skeinforge do its thing.  (I didn't actually check.)\r\n\r\nThese are two of the basic shapes in pyTopMod, except that it builds them edge down.  If there's a way to align faces in TopMod, I didn't find it.  I used blender to rotate them to be face down.  \r\n\r\nI also tried TopMod's soccer ball, but it has too much overhang and failed to build.\r\n\r\nThe whistle is in the picture because I built the plain whistle http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1222 and built a 1cm icosahedron first and dropped it in during build."
