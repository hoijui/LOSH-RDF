function: "All those M3 nuts on the Makerbot Cupcake drive me crazy, especially the ones that are hard to reach on vertical surfaces inside things.  I wish I had something like this when I was building my cupcake.\r\n\r\nThis has a hex hole on the end that should be just about the right size for a single M3 nut.  My machine calibration might be a bit off, so the hole might be too big, let me know! The hole should be snug enough that the nut stays in a little past horizontal, but not so small that you have to press fit it.\r\n\r\nInside the handle is a hole that should be plenty big enough (and long enough) for the longest M3 screws in the cupcake, so not only can you hold the nut to put it in those hard to reach places, but you can screw it most of the way down even on the long screws.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the ABS plastic isn't quite hard enough (or the nut socket is too big) to actually tighten the nuts down."
