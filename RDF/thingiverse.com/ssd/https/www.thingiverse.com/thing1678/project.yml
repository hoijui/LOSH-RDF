function: "Ok, so this is a 2d object for a postscript printer, instead of a 3d printer.\r\n\r\nBut we have rulers and protractors in the tool list, and there are those out there who may not be so endowed.  So if you've got a printer, and no protractor, you now have no excuse.\r\n\r\nI wrote this years ago when I was learning postscript, thought it would be useful here."
