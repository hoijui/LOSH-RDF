function: "These hooks are sized to hang several typical computer video, power, and network cables from a table or wall or something. \r\n\r\nThe small hook can be placed with the flat side mounted either up or back.  \r\n\r\nThe large hook is designed for gravity to pull the cables towards the front to minimize bunching up and blocking the opening when hanging lots of cables together, and has a long neck to make drilling screw holes easier for extra sturdy mounting.\r\n\r\nBoth hooks can be mounted with double sided foam sticky tape.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: fixed a thin spot in cablehook-sm.  If someone knows a better way to get this shape out of blender, I'd be interested."
