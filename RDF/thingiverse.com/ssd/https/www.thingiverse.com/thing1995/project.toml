function = "Yet another makerbot Z stage crank...\r\n\r\nAll the other cranks are nice (I like http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1359 in particular) but they all have those pesky handles.  And with the foldable crank, every now and then I forget to fold it and it runs into something.\r\nAlso, I found that I wasn't using the handle that sticks up -- I'd just use the length of the crank for leverage and push it around with my finger.\r\n\r\nSo, this crank is a little bit longer than the foldable crank when folded, and instead of a handle, it has three possible places you can stick a finger for maximum comfort and control."
