function: "This is a string winder is for making coils of string using a figure 8 pattern sometimes known as a mountaineer's coil.\r\n\r\nThis is designed for a 6mm square chopstick to fit in the holes.  This design is unfortunately not parametric, but I've left enough steps in the blender model for it to be easily modified.\r\n\r\nA pair of 5 inch posts easily holds a 100 feet of 3/32\" string.\r\n\r\nLayer 1 has the final meshed part; layer 2 has the winding posts.  Layer 3 has the part with the original bezier curves.  There should be enough here to modify it for whatever posts you have.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I've uploaded a larger version for those with big hands."
