function = "I took guru\\'s very cool OpenSCAD file, cleaned it up, made it fully parametric, and fiddled with the parameters.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the following parameters are different:\r\n* I made the rings a bit thicker so the build quality is improved.\r\n* The number of rings is now adjustable, and they are arranged in a circle.\r\n* I played with the tilt of the rings and the distance between them so they didn\\'t overlap.  (necessary, since they are now bigger)\r\n* The *tor* versions have had the cylinder section replaced with a toroid and have been further tweaked.\r\n\r\nThe ideal offset between rings could probably be calculated, but I don\\'t feel like thinking that hard just right now.  (Maybe in a future revision.)\r\n\r\nI\\'ve included here 3 and 7 ring sets.  Up to 7 can be made before the first and last rings overlap. The toroid version has been tweaked so that 10 rings can fit and make a complete circle.\r\n\r\nGuru\\'s original design makes the ring out of a section of a cylinder, and I have left that version in the file.  I have included a torus (revolved circle) version of the ring as well.  However, the torus version, due to the slightly smaller perimeter, has a slightly worse surface finish.  (I may tweak this and try a larger diameter later.)"
