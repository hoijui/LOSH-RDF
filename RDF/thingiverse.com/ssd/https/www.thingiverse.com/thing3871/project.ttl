    okh:function """This is a revisit of my previous candy dispenser (which is also included in the scad file), except the printed cavity is replaced with a Prego 24 oz sauce bottle.  (Let me know if you need more details to find one.)  The top here screws tightly into the bottle's threads using a simple mechanism similar to what the jar's original lid uses.  (If you over tighten, it will harmlessly slip off the end of the threads and go around another time while remaining tight.)  \r
If you can't find a bottle this size, you can modify the dimensions in the scad file to match your bottle.  (If you need help with this, I'll add a test part that prints quickly for fit checking.  I used one, but didn't include it in this scad file unfortunately.)  \r
The slide has a hole on each side for two springs.  It only needs one.  I left out the spring entirely, gravity feed works well enough.  \r
I've also experimented with several different sizes, all successful variations are still in this file, just uncomment the set you like.  \r
The STL files here are sized for Jelly Belly jellybeans.  It also works for Skittles and Reece's Pieces, but sometimes dispenses two at a time.  (This is a feature!)  Unfortunately, peanutbutter M&M's are a much larger diameter, and don't fit.  (But the scad file probably could be adjusted for them, I haven't tried.)  There are several sets of preset sizes listed in the scad file if you want to choose a different variation.""" ;
