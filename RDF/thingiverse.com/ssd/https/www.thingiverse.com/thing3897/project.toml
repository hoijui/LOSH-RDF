function = "Yet another wire hanger...\r\n\r\nThis is designed to temporarily hold wires.  The sides should be flexible, so the wire can both slip in and out with a small amount of force.  The opening is tapered to help make this easy.\r\n\r\nThis clip has less bottom surface area than some of the other wire hangers, and so might not hold to the adhesive as well.  This might limit the amount of weight it can support."
