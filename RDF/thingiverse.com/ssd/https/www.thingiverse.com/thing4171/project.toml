function = "I have a netgear gs105 network switch, which has no fan and vents on the side.  I think it was designed to hang on a wall by its screw holes, because it overheats sitting flat.\r\n\r\nSo I built this stand to let me put it on its side while elevating it high enough to keep the vents clear.  It runs much cooler this way!  I notice the newer models netgear sells come with a stand.\r\n\r\nThis model is parametric, so if you\\'ve got a different device with a different width, you can adjust it to fit."
