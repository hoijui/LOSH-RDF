\r
So I built this stand to let me put it on its side while elevating it high enough to keep the vents clear.  It runs much cooler this way!  I notice the newer models netgear sells come with a stand.\r
\r
This model is parametric, so if you\\'ve got a different device with a different width, you can adjust it to fit.""" ;
