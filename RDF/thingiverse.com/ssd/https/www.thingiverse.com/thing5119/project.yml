function: "This part is an example of interesting support structure more than a part most people would find useful.\r\n\r\nI have a waterproof camera case with a latch that broke in the first month I had the case.  Rather than order a new latch from the company with the same flaw, I decided to just make one -- and the printed one is much stronger, despite having nearly the same dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe build direction for this part was chosen for maximum strength, although other directions would probably also need support structure of some sort."
