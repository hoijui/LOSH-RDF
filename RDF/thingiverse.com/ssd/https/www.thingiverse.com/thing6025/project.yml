function: "Variations on a golf ball...  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first attempt didn't survive meeting the club, this one is sturdier.  The hollow one survived one hit with a putter, but not the driver.  The version with internal heavy support survived at least one hit with the driver.  (But, being white, it was lost.  Next one I make will be fluorescent red.)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe -sh version is hollow, but with external supports.  \r\n\r\nThe -ss version has heavy internal support and thin external supports.  \r\n\r\nThe -out version is the outside only, drawn in blender.  \r\n\r\nThe scad version hollows the outside from blender and adds the support pieces.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI challenge someone to figure out how to do the blender part in openscad! (Wtih parametric depth or something...)"
