function: "I wanted a small box to hold a few pills that would keep them clean and safe from crushing.  But this box could be used for anything small with some adjustments to the cavity shape.  The lid uses a dovetail joint for tightness and fit tolerance.\r\n\r\nThis model is fully parametric, but some of the parameters need some work so that the adjusted box always works.  Some of the walls may be thicker than necessary.  \r\n\r\nThe first design holds 4 pills in two stacks.  The second design holds 5 pills on their edge instead.\r\n\r\nThe second version of the lid has a square indention (which bridges nicely) to make opening the box easier.\r\n\r\nThe outside dimensions of the two boxes are identical."
