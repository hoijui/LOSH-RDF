Special thanks for WilliamAAdams' work on OpenScad 3d math!\r\n\r\nYou can use this script to print vertices for creating any wireframe model. The script can accept vectors for all directions the edges have to go. Cut your edges and you have your solid wireframe model.\r\n\r\nFor fun and pleasure, and for all math enthousiasts, all regular solids are added to the script. See the script for details on how to generate the vertices."
