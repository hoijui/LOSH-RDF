function: "2021/08/08 - UPDATED design for better readability of results. please use v2021 files.\r\n\r\n2021/07/22 - STEP file added\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++\r\nAn homage to Gary Gygax. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax)\r\n\r\nThis is perfect for when your die goes under that immovable piece of furniture and you NEED to summon you magic missile spell against the attacking Orcs.\r\n\r\nMany a lost weekend were spent praying to the gods of chance.\r\n\r\n*** Don't step on these babies, they hurt.\r\nI tried to round the corners enough to make for a blunt puncture wound.\r\n\r\nI've included the SolidEdge ST3 source files if anyone wants."
