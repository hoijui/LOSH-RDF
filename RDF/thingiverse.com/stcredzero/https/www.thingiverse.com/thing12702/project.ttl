    okh:function """This is a fully functional microphone shock mount for a side-address microphone.  (Also called a "spider mount.") It's functionally equivalent to equipment that can cost around $50 to buy retail.  This design is meant to be printed on a RepRap style 3D printer.  \r
\r
This design is parametric -- that is, it can be scaled up to larger diameters fairly easily and thanks to the truss structure, it has the excess strength to accomodate that.  \r
\r
(Also, to head off the inevitable comment, the hose clamp does not touch the mount body.  There is 3mm clearance, and that's the largest hose clamp that will work for the design shown in the pictures.  This was actually made for my Austin Ribbon Mic, and there's plenty of space for that one, as it's a narrower mic using a smaller hose clamp.)""" ;
