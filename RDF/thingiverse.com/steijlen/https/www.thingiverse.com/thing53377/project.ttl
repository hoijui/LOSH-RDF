    okh:function """These are four corners I designed for my new 3dprinter. \r
During building my first 3dprinter I gained a lot of knowledge and came up with ideas to improve the initial design. I started to improve these corners. They support the steel rods for the y-carriage and support the bearings for the steel rods that drive the left x-carriage and the right x-carriage. (People who are familiar with the Replicator will know what I mean).\r
The bearings in the two corners at the back can be adjusted with a M3 screw. You can use 5mm (inside) x 16mm (outside) x 5mm (thickness) bearings.\r
The corner constructions will hold M3 nuts so they can be mounted to the side panels and front or back panel.\r
The corners are designed for 8mm steel rods.\r
Corner_RF = Right Front, LF = Left front, RB = Right Back, LB = Left Back.\r
Corner_RF will hold an optical end-stop.\r
For any questions please contact me.""" ;
