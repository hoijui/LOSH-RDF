function: "These are four corners I designed for my new 3dprinter. \r\nDuring building my first 3dprinter I gained a lot of knowledge and came up with ideas to improve the initial design. I started to improve these corners. They support the steel rods for the y-carriage and support the bearings for the steel rods that drive the left x-carriage and the right x-carriage. (People who are familiar with the Replicator will know what I mean).\r\nThe bearings in the two corners at the back can be adjusted with a M3 screw. You can use 5mm (inside) x 16mm (outside) x 5mm (thickness) bearings.\r\nThe corner constructions will hold M3 nuts so they can be mounted to the side panels and front or back panel.\r\nThe corners are designed for 8mm steel rods.\r\nCorner_RF = Right Front, LF = Left front, RB = Right Back, LB = Left Back.\r\nCorner_RF will hold an optical end-stop.\r\nFor any questions please contact me."
