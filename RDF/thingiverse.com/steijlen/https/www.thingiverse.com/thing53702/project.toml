function = "This is a y-motor-support for my new to build plexi-printer. (Plexi because I am going to make this printer from Polystyrene / clear Plexiglas).\r\n\r\nYou can look at the pictures to see how it is meant to be used.\r\n\r\nIt will be mounted to the back and to the right-side. In the right-back corner. About 80 mm from the top.\r\n\r\nThe motor can be adjusted to keep the belt tension right. I will probably use a 160Lx6Wmm T2.5 timing belt.\r\n\r\nIt will support a NEMA-17 motor."
