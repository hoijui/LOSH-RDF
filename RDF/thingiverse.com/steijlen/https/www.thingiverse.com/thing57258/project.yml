function: "This is my Y-Carriage (with Motor) to be used in my new to develop 3d-plexi-printer.\r\n \r\nIt can hold a NEMA 17 motor. You can adjust it to tighten the y-timing belt.\r\n \r\nIt has a piece to act with an optical end stop.\r\n \r\nYou need the other Y-Carriage (without Motor) on the opposite side of the printer.\r\n \r\nIt is made for 8mm steel rods and T2.5 timing belt.\r\n \r\nJust examine the file to see if you can use it.\r\n \r\nFor any questions please contact me."
