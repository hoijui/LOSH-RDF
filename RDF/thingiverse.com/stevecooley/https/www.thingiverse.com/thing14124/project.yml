function: 'I was just reading the thingiverse blog old entries and found out about sculptris.  So I ran it through some tests, and this is the second drawing that popped out. Surprise: it''s another cat drawing.  There''s some weird thing going on internally with the mesh. I couldn''t figure out how to fix this in meshlab or any other tool.  Does anyone know how to kill internal vertices in a model?'
