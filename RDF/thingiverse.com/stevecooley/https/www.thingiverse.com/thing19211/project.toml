function = "This is a knob for a slide potentiometer.  If you've ever had to locate a source for these kinds of knobs, you know that your options are limited at best, ridiculously expensive at medium, and totally absent at worst. \r\n\r\nWell, with a 3d printer (and optionally, the awesome Jetty firmware,) you can save $1-4 for each knob you print yourself.\r\n\r\nThe wiper on my faders measure 4mm by 1.2mm.  My project uses kind of a lot of these crammed together, so almost all of the standardly available options I was able to find just don't work. Too big, too wide, too ugly, wrong style... So here's my fader knobs. As needed, I will update this thing with different styles and sizes."
