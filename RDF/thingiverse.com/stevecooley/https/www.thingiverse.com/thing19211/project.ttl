Well, with a 3d printer (and optionally, the awesome Jetty firmware,) you can save $1-4 for each knob you print yourself.\r

The wiper on my faders measure 4mm by 1.2mm.  My project uses kind of a lot of these crammed together, so almost all of the standardly available options I was able to find just don't work. Too big, too wide, too ugly, wrong style... So here's my fader knobs. As needed, I will update this thing with different styles and sizes.""" ;
