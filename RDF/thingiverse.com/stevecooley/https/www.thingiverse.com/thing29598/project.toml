function = "This is a generic concept to create a \"keyhole\" slot for your project that you want to hand on a wall by a screw or nail.  The idea is taken directly from the woodworking world, where you would use a keyhole router bit to plunge into a piece of wood, then move along the work piece once the router bit is submerged beneath the surface."
