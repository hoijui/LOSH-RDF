function: "This is a derivative of one of the parts (shoulder_holder_160.stl) that Flummer posted that makes it compatible for printing on a thing-o-matic.  \r\n\r\nBasically the original part prints the whole shoulder rest in one print, and it's just too big to print on my thing-o-matic.  So I chopped it in half, filled the original holes, and put new holes in place. Instead of one hole per half, there are two, so there should be no problem with stability when the shoulder rest is clamped to the rails. \r\n\r\nThis thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/aVRoEzQC9Fa"
