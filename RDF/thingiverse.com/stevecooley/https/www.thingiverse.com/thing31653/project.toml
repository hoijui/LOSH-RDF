function = "This is a derivative of one of the parts from Flummer's DSLR shoulder rig.  The \"dual parallel standard clamp a\" part is too wide to print on a thing-o-matic, so I chopped it in... roughly half... and added the finger joint to join the two parts together.  I was curious to see if the stacked halves would print ok, and they do.  the finish is a bit rough on the top half. Oh well."
