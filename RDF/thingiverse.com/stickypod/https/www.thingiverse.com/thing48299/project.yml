function: A minor modification that will make a world of difference to the accuracy and endurance of your 3D printer.  This is also the easiest way to level your printer bed by simply filing down the PB-Y axis bar mounts on the high side of your bed.  An easy print for beginners because all the settings are in the Gcode.  I have printed these and use them on my bot.
