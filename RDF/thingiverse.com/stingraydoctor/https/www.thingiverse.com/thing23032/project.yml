function: "We are dangling some electronics from a hummingbird feeder.  This coupler is screwed into the top of a watertight container that has a PIT reader and batteries.  There is a bracket to hold an antenna that is   attached with a wire tie. \r\n\r\nI printed this on a MakerBot TOM in ABS.  \r\n\r\nThis is a first revision.  A later revision will have an instrumented perch to weigh the bird.  \r\n\r\nThis is the final version of the Mark I feeder."
