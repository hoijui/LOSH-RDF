function: "During the build of my Huxley, i found that the x-axis was quite complicated compared to Prusa's Mendel. This is my take on his work to suit Huxley. These two parts replace the 12 needed for the origional x axis (plus 10 bearings!).\r\n\r\nI also took inspiration from MarcusWolschon; I shelled the majority of the bulk so it can be filled with casting resin.\r\n\r\nThis is due to be built on a Stratysis Dimension FDM printer so i have not optimised it for a support-less build; I will do so in the future.\r\n\r\nThis has not yet been printed, i will edit later and let you know of my great success/failure! \r\n\r\nFollow my build log on: http://strelly3d.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just optimised it slightly. Reduced build volume by around 7 ccm and hopefully it should be printable on a reprap now."
