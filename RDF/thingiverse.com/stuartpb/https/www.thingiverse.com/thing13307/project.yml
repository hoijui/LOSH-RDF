function: Lots of people I've spoken to- including myself- have these wire grid square storage cube cubby system things. (It's especially popular among the college set.) The generic grid square connector (GSC) that comes with these sets is something I've gathered many unhappy sentiments on. This derivative is designed to address many of the problems of the standard GSC.
