function = "This is a font of polygon-based glyphs, for use in OpenSCAD with [Spiff.scad][]. Check out [Spiff.scad][] for instructions for how to use this.  \n\nThis font was originally made in November 2011 with an impractical `spiffsans_puts` routine that has since been overhauled in favor of two better approaches.  \n\n[Spiff.scad]: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:106256  \n[poorman-spiff]: https://github.com/stuartpb/poorman-spiff  \n\nThe design of this font takes several aesthetic cues from br3ttb's blocky [Small Side Font](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12618). The two fonts are metric-compatible.  \n\nYou can find the YAML description file on this project's Github: https://github.com/stuartpb/spiffsans"
