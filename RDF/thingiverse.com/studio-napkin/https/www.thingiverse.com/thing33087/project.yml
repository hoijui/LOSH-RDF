function: "This is inspired by thing:32633, I liked the look but wanted a couple more features. It can be screwed down to a table or heavy block of wood. Also the phone can go in with headphones attached. I mirrored this dent to the right side to allow some sound to escape the external speaker.\r\n\r\n- It was modeled in ProE-4 and printed on an UP! printer"
