function = "This 2D model is suitable for cutting the parts of a replacement wheel for a trolley bag (wheelie bag). The wheels of different bags are probably not standardized, thus you may need to adjust the inner and outer limits of the model.\r\n\r\nThe attached SVG model is suitable for the following dimensions:\r\n- outer diameter: 64mm\r\n- hole diameter (center): 22mm\r\n- hole diameter (both sides): 12.5mm\r\n- width of center disc: 9,5mm\r\n- width of both side discs: 6,5mm\r\n\r\nSlight differences of the outer diameter or the width of the discs should pose no problem. But you should take care, that the inner diameter of the two outer discs fits to your trolley."
