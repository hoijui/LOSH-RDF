function: "I scoured Thingiverse for a small elephant figurine to give to my girlfriend for Christmas this past year, but didn't find any that I liked.  So, I made this for her, and she loves it!\r\n\r\nUse this semi-anatomically-correct figurine depicting an elephant raising its trunk in happiness to decorate your living room, elephant shrine, evil-but-animal-friendly mad scientist lair, or any other room or space in which to just want the world to feel the love of an elephant.  Give it to loved ones, trick a real elephant into thinking that this is its child, or do any number of other equally fun and entertaining things with this elephant model.  The possibilities are only limited by your imagination! (...and the applicable limitations of your 3D printer, but that's not the point.)"
