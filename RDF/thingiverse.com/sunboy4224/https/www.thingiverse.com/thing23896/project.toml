function = "I first started making this model years ago, before I even heard of 3D printing, to serve as a mascot to my high school band, HydraPlayn (yes, my dad and I came up with that name driving on a rainy day, no we weren't a particularly serious band, and yes...we were extremely awesome).  Unfortunately, I was never able to finish it in time to put it onto any graphics before I had to leave for college.  Since then, it has just been a little pet project to practice my 3D modeling skills.  When my father and I got a 3D printer, however, I knew that I had to print this out.  After a few modifications to make it printer-friendly, the hydra lives!\r\n\r\nUse this Hydra figurine, depicting the mythical multi-headed beast bickering among itself, to make any space more lively.  Set it up in the kitchen as a decoration, in the bedroom to guard you while you sleep, or hide it in a rival's locker to scare the Hades out of them."
