The last couple of days my life has mostly been revolving around Impact Sprinklers! I think that Impact Sprinklers might be the coolest things since sliced bread. They are also most certainly printable. And, given enough work, probably actually useful.\r
\r
My fascination started when I saw: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10127\r
I have never been in close contact with an actual Impact Sprinkler, but believe me when I tell you that I have seen many YouTube-clips of them in action. I still canâ€™t figure everything* out thou. I have not yet fully understood the concept of how you get the sprinkler to reverse the cycle so this is a 360 degree sprinkler.\r
\r
This is my first thingiverse upload â€“ itâ€™s a scetchup file of mainly 2 parts: a sprinkler head and a spoon-arm (or whatever the technical term is). In addition to these parts you would need a rubber band** and a bolt. The bolt in order to get the two parts to stick together. And the rubber band to force the spoon-arm against the head (thats what the nob on the arm is for). You will also need the tubing to connect the head to your water.\r
\r
I do not own a printer yet â€“ so there is no way for me to try printing this. Itâ€™s just a raw sketchup file and I imagine that there are lots of tweeks to be done in order to print this â€“ if that is even possible (?) - I have not learned that part yet. Sorry.\r
\r
On a sidenote â€“ I donâ€™t have a lawn either.\r
\r
My hope is that someone out there finds this helpful and all comments are welcome!\r

Updates:\r
Some stuff you learn the hard way: http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2011/07/22/google-sketchup-design-tip-fix-flipped-faces/\r
\r
So, I have reverced the facets and touched up the head and arm and cleand off that other stuff and saved to two separet files (they still dont render - here on thingiverse - dont know if they are supposed to - being sketchup files.\r
\r
Anyone concidering printing probebly want to redsign the neck before doing so.\r
\r

\r
Mark 2 in progress.\r
Realising now that im not going to have time to finish it anytime soon. so here is a flat image for your inspiration! See attached preview.\r
