function: "Hello World,\r\nThe last couple of days my life has mostly been revolving around Impact Sprinklers! I think that Impact Sprinklers might be the coolest things since sliced bread. They are also most certainly printable. And, given enough work, probably actually useful.\r\n\r\nMy fascination started when I saw: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10127\r\nI have never been in close contact with an actual Impact Sprinkler, but believe me when I tell you that I have seen many YouTube-clips of them in action. I still can\xE2\u20AC\u2122t figure everything* out thou. I have not yet fully understood the concept of how you get the sprinkler to reverse the cycle so this is a 360 degree sprinkler.\r\n\r\nThis is my first thingiverse upload \xE2\u20AC\u201C it\xE2\u20AC\u2122s a scetchup file of mainly 2 parts: a sprinkler head and a spoon-arm (or whatever the technical term is). In addition to these parts you would need a rubber band** and a bolt. The bolt in order to get the two parts to stick together. And the rubber band to force the spoon-arm against the head (thats what the nob on the arm is for). You will also need the tubing to connect the head to your water.\r\n\r\nI do not own a printer yet \xE2\u20AC\u201C so there is no way for me to try printing this. It\xE2\u20AC\u2122s just a raw sketchup file and I imagine that there are lots of tweeks to be done in order to print this \xE2\u20AC\u201C if that is even possible (?) - I have not learned that part yet. Sorry.\r\n\r\nOn a sidenote \xE2\u20AC\u201C I don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t have a lawn either.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that someone out there finds this helpful and all comments are welcome!\r\n\r\nLinks to cool stuff and inspiration:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10189 \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9596\r\n\r\nCloseup-Slowmo:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6g7OSvI5GQ&NR=1\r\n\r\nCommercial 3D Printed Impact Sprinkler in action:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHpg082Tc0\r\n(Please note, this is not my design, only a link to someone who have successfully printed a Impact Sprinkler)\r\n\r\n\r\n*not entirely sure that I have understood anything..\r\n**Strong I imagine. (or a spring)\r\n\r\n=====================================================\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\nSome stuff you learn the hard way: http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2011/07/22/google-sketchup-design-tip-fix-flipped-faces/\r\n\r\nSo, I have reverced the facets and touched up the head and arm and cleand off that other stuff and saved to two separet files (they still dont render - here on thingiverse - dont know if they are supposed to - being sketchup files.\r\n\r\nAnyone concidering printing probebly want to redsign the neck before doing so.\r\n\r\n=====================================================\r\n\r\nMark 2 in progress.\r\nRealising now that im not going to have time to finish it anytime soon. so here is a flat image for your inspiration! See attached preview.\r\n\r\n====================================================="
