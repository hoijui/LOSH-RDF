function = "These are standard size fins for a shortboard in thruster configuration (3 fins).  These fins are made to be compatible with fin boxes made by ProBox.  But they can easily be made compatible with FCS fin boxes by cutting a notch in the tab at the base, or glassed on if the tab is fully removed.  **UPDATE**  Added a crude futures compatible base.  Be aware that Futures side fins have cant built into the fin rather than into the base like FCS and ProBox.   \n\nIf you like these checkout mesheldrake's Cardboard Surfboard http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4764 or his other boards at http://sheldrake.net/cardboards/  \nHis most excellent work on these cardboard surfboards inspired this creation.  \n\nAlso check out my Longboard trailer fin at thingiverse.com/thing:12496  \nand my longboard side bites at thingiverse.com/thing:12497"
