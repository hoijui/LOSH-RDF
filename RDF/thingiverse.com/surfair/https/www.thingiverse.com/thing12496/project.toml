function = "This is a center fin for a longboard, it can be used as a single fin or in a thruster setup.  I am still working on the lower tab for proper insertion in a standard fin box.  The tab can easily be removed to glass the fin on. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso check out my shortboard fins at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12495\r\nand my longboard side bites at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12497\r\n\r\nIf you like these checkout mesheldrake's Cardboard Surfboard thingiverse.com/thing:4764 or his other boards at sheldrake.net/cardboards/\r\nHis most excellent work on these cardboard surfboards inspired this creation."
