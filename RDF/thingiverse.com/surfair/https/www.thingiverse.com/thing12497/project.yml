function: "These are side fins for a longboard in thruster configuration (3 fins). These fins are made to be compatible with fin boxes made by Future Fins. But they can easily be made compatible with FCS fin boxes by cutting a notch in the tab at the base, or glassed on if the tab is fully removed.\r\n\r\nThese fins are specifically designed for a longboard, but could also work as side fins on a quad or to make a shortboard trailer fin for small days.\r\n\r\nAlso check out my shortboard fins at thingiverse.com/thing:12495\r\nand my londboard trailer fin at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12496 \r\n\r\nIf you like these checkout mesheldrake's Cardboard Surfboard thingiverse.com/thing:4764 or his other boards at sheldrake.net/cardboards/\r\nHis most excellent work on these cardboard surfboards inspired this creation."
