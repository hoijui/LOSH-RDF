function: These disks will hold up to thirteen 3 mm or seven 5 mm LEDs. They have tabs on the side that you can use to mount them to whatever you like.  They are designed so that you can press-fit the LEDs, requiring no adhesive or fasteners.  They were designed as part of our (i3 Detroit) "Squiggly Trike" entry in the Red Bull Creation challenge in NYC last July.
