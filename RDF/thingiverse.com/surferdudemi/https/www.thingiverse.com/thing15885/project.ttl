    okh:function "We wanted something fun to add to out \"Squiggle Trike\" at the Red Bull Creation competition last July.  We had some miscellaneous stuff like solar cells, small motors, etc.  What to do ... ?  A bubble maker to leave a trail of bubbles behind as the trike moves!  We had a Thing-O-Matic available, courtesy of MakerBot, so I spent a little time in SketchUp, tweaked it a little, and voila!  It has two different sized holes to allow for variation in the soap mixture.  Hopefully one or both will work for you." ;
