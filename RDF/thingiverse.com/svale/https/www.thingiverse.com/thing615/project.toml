function = "After seeing some kids playing with a little air plane powered by compressed air from a soda bottle, I decided to see if I could make a laser cuttable version of such a motor.\r\n\r\nThis is not a very powerful or efficient motor, but it is a fully working printable (\"cuttable\"?) air vane motor. My next goal will be to make a full printable bottle-powered park-flyer.\r\n\r\nA video of the motor in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reaB0R9ALHs\r\n\r\nMore on air vane motors:\r\nhttp://www.hydraulicspneumatics.com/200/TechZone/FluidPowerAcces/Article/True/6422/TechZone-FluidPowerAcces\r\n\r\nMatt made a version for 3D printers.
