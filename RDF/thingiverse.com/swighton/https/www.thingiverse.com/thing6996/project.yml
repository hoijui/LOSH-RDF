function: I've found that tweezers are the only tool that I use all the time with the RepRap (to remove crud from the nozzle) and I can never find them. This clamps onto one of the frame rods of the RepRap to keep your tweezers handy. Note that it was designed for 3/8" rod, though it should fit the metric rods if you put a piece of tape around them first to make them slightly larger.
