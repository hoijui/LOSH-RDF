function = "This is a light that I made to go around the nozzle of my RepRap inspired by other lights I have seen on here for the Makerbot. It uses six standard white LEDs taken from dollar store flashlights. Its made in two pieces, the top piece holds the LEDs and the back piece is a channel for the wires. The reason for the back piece is for insulation as my RepRap is made of metal."
