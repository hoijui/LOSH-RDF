function = "This is a cover custom fit to the extruder controller 2.2. It has openings for all of the screw terminals and the RJ45 jack. It fits snugly around the board. Its walls are thin (approx 1mm) so it doesn't use much plastic. I don't recommend printing it without a heated bed - I did and you can see my results aren't particularly amazing.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI've made a second version of the cover that has a reset button."
