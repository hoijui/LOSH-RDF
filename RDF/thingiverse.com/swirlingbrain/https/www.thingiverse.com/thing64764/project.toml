function = "I have updated this sculpture here (making this one pretty much obsolete:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2088710\r\nI'm keeping this model here on thingiverse just \"because\", but seriously, choose to print the updated model instead. (the link above)\r\n\r\nThis is a nice desktop sized rolling ball sculpture I made to print on my 3D printer that hasn't arrived yet.  I haven't printed or tested it yet so print at your own risk. (Caution:  It may not print well at all!  I don't know.  Still waiting on my 3D printer.)  \r\nRev B:  tried to make everything flat on the floor.  Put a stick inside the balls also so that it has a flat foot on the floor.  Enlarged the size.  \r\nRev C:  Fattened up all the rods to give them more strength.  Made the banking of the curves less steep.  Increased the drop angle slightly.  Adjusted some of the angles on the braces.  Changed the track slightly to help with the underpass.  Got the size thing figured out so it should be the right size now.  I still don't have a 3d printer so I don't know if it will print or work correctly so print at your own risk.  Thanks to all those that are giving me tips and help.  \r\n\r\nHere's a video of one printed on Shapeways:  \r\nhttp://youtu.be/txI3vMfinHU"
