function: "I have an Amiga on which I still enjoy playing old classics. Unfortunately I am having a hard time finding functional joysticks. I found one which was beyond repair, and decided to apply a bit of 3D printing to save it!\r\n\r\nIt does not look good but it works perfectly. Only one button switch worked, so I made it a one button stick. The top of the stick body houses the original switch, and the printed button clips on top. It is quite robust in fact, and works very well (we played Kick Off 2 a full afternoon without trouble!)\r\nI believe many similar models were available back then, so it might help you as well...\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
