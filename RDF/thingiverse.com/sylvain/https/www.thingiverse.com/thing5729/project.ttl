Their decision is extremely destructive and also underlines that the patent system is obsolete as it no longer serves any purpose for the betterment of society. Its main role is as a blunt weapon used by incumbents to hamper innovation.  
I see absolutely no reason to continue indirectly supporting Stratasys by providing free content to Thingiverse.""" ;
