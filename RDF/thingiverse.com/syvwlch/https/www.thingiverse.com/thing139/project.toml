function = "This is a 3D model of a section of the nave of a Gothic church. \r\n\r\nI based the height to width ratio on the golden section,and the design of the arches on the basic Gothic proportions, so nothing very new. I hope to add the side alleys and some flying buttresses in a later version.\r\n\r\nThe only clever trick is the use of little cross-shaped pieces to hold the two parts of the pillars together, one at the base, and one at the top, resting on a little shelf. Since the pillar parts that slot into each other are rather long, you need this trick to keep them from sliding side to side."
