function = "This is a first attempt at modifying RustedRobot's ratchet design so that it can carry significant radial loads, e.g. from the weight hanging off the power drum of a clock.\r\nThe current design relies on the ratchet arms to carry the load, but they have to remain thin and springy as well... So far in the clock, this has required a complicated and thick part which must use spokes that reach over the inner wheel to reach the shaft.\r\nHopefully with this refinement, the ratchet can carry large radial loads, be contained in a single gear's thickness and perhaps even be printed in place."
