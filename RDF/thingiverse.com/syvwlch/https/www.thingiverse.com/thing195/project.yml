function: "It's the one missing feature: not backlighting, no reading in the dark.\r\n\r\nThis is a prototype of a solution: a sheet of clear acrylic that fits into the screen's bevel and another opaque sheet that covers it at the bottom (you only lose the page count that way, no text) and the upper corners. The idea is to add an LED in each corner (there is enough clearance between the opaque part and the reader's faceplate) to illuminate the beveled corners of the transparent part, which should become a waveguide."
