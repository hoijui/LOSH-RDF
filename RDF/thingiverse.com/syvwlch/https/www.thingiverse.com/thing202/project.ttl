\r
Change log:\r
1. Made the spines that run the length of the hull twice as thick, for structural support and for aesthetics.\r
2. Re-made the ribs that define the cross-section of the hull from scratch with circular voids and fine-tuned dimensions for aesthetics and better fit.\r
3. Hollowed out the legs for aesthetics.\r
4. Re-made the feet using the same spine & rib method as the hull, for consistency, for the challenge, for aesthetics, and for the win!\r
5. Re-arranged the pieces on the cutting pattern so that you could cut from two rectangles instead of a single square.""" ;
