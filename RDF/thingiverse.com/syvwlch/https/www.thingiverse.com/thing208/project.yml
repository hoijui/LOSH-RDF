function: "I took Fountain's Birdhouse, and added two suction cup holes to the back.\r\n\r\nNow you can attach it to your window. :-)\r\n\r\nTook all of five minutes using the existing suction cup hole Thing ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:207 ) and Fountain's original design, and most of that was making sure the scales were correct.\r\n\r\nFurther refinements might include adding a little tab sticking out the back (from the floor piece) to keep the house level once the suction cups are attached to a vertical surface."
