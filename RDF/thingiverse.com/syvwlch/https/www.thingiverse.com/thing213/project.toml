function = "This is a notch width test pattern, with notches cut into both sides from 0.100\" to 0.150\" wide in 0.01\" steps. The idea, obviously, is to straddle the 1/8\" or 0.125\" nominal thickness of the material.\r\n\r\nSince 0.01\" should be on the same order of magnitude as the kerf (material lost to the laser's cut), I didn't think we needed more precision."
