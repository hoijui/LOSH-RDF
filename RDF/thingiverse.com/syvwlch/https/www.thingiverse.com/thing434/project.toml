function = "Something a bit more practical made with TopMod, and with a direct reference to RepRap myth and lore: an organic, topologically generated shotglass which should print just fine in a RepRap or MakerBot but be a bit more interesting than the usual spent-ammo-casing tubes... \r\n\r\nAfterall, who wants to toast a new 3D printer with something you could make in a lathe or in a mold?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Added a variant with a twist. Same licence, download, modify, print... or do what TMR did and make your own from scratch after you see the tutorial video!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Added a variant with a flat base and a diamond pattern in the filigree, as per Zach\\'s suggestions. It should print more cleanly.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It slices in Skeinforge, and it prints on a MakerBot. Screenshot added."
