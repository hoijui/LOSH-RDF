function: "I was curious to see if I could make a stemmed wineglass with some of the same methods used in the shotglass.\r\n\r\nI took TMR's idea to put the filigree on the outside, and I added the stem and foot after the glass was shaped, using extrusions. The decisive trick was adding an inner shaft inside the stem's filigree... I wasn't sure it would be strong enough otherwise."
