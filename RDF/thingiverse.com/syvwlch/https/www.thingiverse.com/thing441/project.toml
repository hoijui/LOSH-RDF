function = "A deceptively complex little holder for your next soft-boiled egg, or that collectible autographed baseball. It looks like a simple plastic utensil until you examine it more closely, and look inside.\r\n\r\nThe outer shell is smooth, with a few softly rounded holes in it, but it's held up by columns half-hidden inside, as is the floor of the well in the center."
