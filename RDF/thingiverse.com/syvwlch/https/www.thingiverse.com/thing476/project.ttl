\r
You'll end up with a section of wing 10cm in span, a little more than that in chord (leading edge to trailing edge).\r
\r
I used the fact that the Clark Y is flat on much of its bottom to print out that part of it horizontally, rather than standing up. I had to cut the wing into two pieces, chord-wise, but I think it should be a lot easier to print this way... and securing the two halves shouldn't be a major undertaking. Anyone up for making a tab-and-slot version?\r
