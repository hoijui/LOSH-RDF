function = "This variant of the Hexagonal Column does away with the FlatRoll concept and goes for interlocking tabs instead. No need for a flexible substrate, six of these segments should lock together to form a box.\r\n\r\nThe 45 degree overhang rule is met, and the individual parts are much bigger (no need to share the printing volume with the other five) with finer details, so this should print out fine.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Added an anaglyph picture, bring out your red/blue glasses!"
