function: "Skeinforge wasn\\\\\\'t happy with the last version of the Hexagonal Box, and after some discussion on the Thingiverse Google Group (recommended reading, by the way), Zach pointed out that non-manifold vertices were a possible culprit.\r\n\r\nWell, turns out he was right! I went back to Sketchup, eliminated all the points in the model where two pieces of the model touched along a single edge, ran it thru MeshLab to check for mesh defects and export to STL, scaled the STL in Blender, and then ran SkeinForge on the STL file... getting a beautiful toolpath.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone on the Group for the suggestions/tips/tricks!\r\n\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/thingiverse"
