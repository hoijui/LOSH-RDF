function = "Inspired by Zach's bracelet V1, and some other things he showed me at NYCR yesterday...\r\n\r\nI think the bracelet may be too thin to print with enough resolution for the text to look good, or even be readable. Might need to make something more like a cuff, with a single word, perhaps?\r\n\r\nEDIT: The combined mesh/toolpath detail view of the first word on the bracelet actually looks better than I expected. It won't look perfect, but it might be quite readable... and clearly, slightly larger text should look great!"
