\r
I think the bracelet may be too thin to print with enough resolution for the text to look good, or even be readable. Might need to make something more like a cuff, with a single word, perhaps?\r
\r
EDIT: The combined mesh/toolpath detail view of the first word on the bracelet actually looks better than I expected. It won't look perfect, but it might be quite readable... and clearly, slightly larger text should look great!""" ;
