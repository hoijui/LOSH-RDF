function = "All the randomness of a Russian Roulette game, without the drama.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that putting numbers on dice when we can put pretty much anything we want was... a little square. Since a cube is simple to design, I figure I'd start with a d6 die. Die... hey, Russian Roulette!\r\n\r\nTasteless, and easy to express with simple emoticons, so no need to draw or anything."
