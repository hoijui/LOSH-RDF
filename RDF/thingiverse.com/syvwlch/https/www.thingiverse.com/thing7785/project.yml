function: "The escapement is the part of a mechanical clock that keeps the pendulum swinging despite friction losses by imparting it with the potential energy of a weight, or spring, while transforming the regular swings of the pendulum into regular increments of rotation of the escapement wheel, which can then drive a gear train to show seconds, minutes, hours, etc...\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapement\r\n\r\nA Graham escapement is also known as a dead-beat escapement because it does not force the wheel to move anti-clockwise during the parts of the cycle when no impulse is being given to the pendulum, i.e. it produces no recoil.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.abbeyclock.com/bbigrhm.html\r\n\r\nThis Openscad design should allow you to create a variety of Graham escapements, with different numbers of teeth for the wheel, different escapement gaps, etc... It is fully parameterized and commented.\r\n\r\nI created it as an exercise in understanding escapements, and Openscad, and plan to eventually build up to a full clock. I'm amazed by how far, how fast I got with Openscad, BTW, it rocks! :-)"
