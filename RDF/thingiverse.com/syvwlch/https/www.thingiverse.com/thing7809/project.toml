function = "Maker Block asked if there was a way to have fewer, larger teeth on the escapement wheel, and thanks to the power of parametric design in OpenSCAD, the answer was a resounding yes!\r\n\r\nWith the larger teeth, this should be much easier to print.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: added a beefier, thicker version, slightly smaller so the pendulum fits inside the build platform. Duncha love parametric designs?)"
