Thank you team! :-)

___________WARNING_________  



Several bugs have been fixed since this release, and the current tip-of-the-spear for development is a simplified 2-gear clock with only minutes and seconds.  



Current development version to be found on git hub here:  

github.com/syvwlch/Printable-Clock-Project  



Current version of the 8-Gear Clock (revision D):

Thanks to RustedRobot for his continued assistance debugging the clock!   

___________WARNING_________  



This is both a derivative of the printable clock PoC, and of my escapement library: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7822 . The involute gear profiles are from the MCAD library.  



(EDIT: The clock got a mention by Cory Doctorow on boing boing!  

http://www.boingboing.net/2011/04/23/model-files-for-a-wo.html )  



I cleaned up the code so it would render faster, moved all the gear work into the library, and created a laidOutToPrint() module to facilitate creating the STLs of the individual parts. I included an optional print volume visualizer, so you can check every part doesn't exceed the printer's capabilities.  



The assembled() module is still fully animate-able, and I've added colors to help see if everything meshes properly.  



The clock itself now has clip-on hands, front & back frames, and most importantly, I switched to a different set of gear ratios (3.2, 3, 2.5 & 2.5) which allows for bigger shafts by keeping the ratios small.   



Assuming an 80x80x80mm printing volume, you now have a bit more than 12mm (almost half an inch!) available for the overall diameter of the shaft, the two sleeves that slide over it and the necessary clearances.  



I think this configuration is close to final, except for the escapement, which will need fine-tuning... but without re-printing the rest of the clock.""" ;
