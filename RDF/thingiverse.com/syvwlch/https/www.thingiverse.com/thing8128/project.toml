It seemed ok to do so, since rustedrobot mods his parts with a drill to get the same result. ;-)\r\n\r\nThis script relies on both the MCAD involute_gear library and on my own clockwork library.\r\n\r\nCurrent repository for the latest version of the clockwork library:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8155"
