Thinking about how to encase the whole clock in a big solid cube, for some real rigidity)\r\n\r\n/* The Printable Clock Project by Syvwlch, \r\nwith help from MakerBlock, rustedrobot, barrychuck, \r\nand many others at Thingiverse. \r\n\r\n8-Gear Clock\r\n\r\nRevision C\r\n- Extended frame to include escapement\r\n- Retro-fitted code clean-up from other clock designs\r\n\r\nRevision B\r\n- Changed gear ratios to make a 12-hour clock, rather than a 60-hour clock\r\n\r\nRevision A\r\n- Original release\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8136\r\n\r\nCC-A-SA licensed.*/\r\n\r\nThis script uses the MCAD involute_gear library and my own clockwork library."
