    okh:function """This is the repository for my clockwork library, which I've been developing for the printable clock project. I will upload future versions here, to keep them separate from the clock scripts.\r
\r
Current development version to be found on git hub here:\r
https://github.com/syvwlch/Printable-Clock-Project\r
\r
As code from the clock scripts matures, I will move it into this library to facilitate re-use. So far I have been able to keep the library backwards-compatible, and I will try to continue that way.\r
\r
/*\r
This is an OpenSCAD library to create various pinion wheels, escapements and other pieces of clockwork gearing\r
Uses the MCAD involute_gears library and will not work without it!\r

\r
v1 - 2011 04 15\r
First library version of the code\r
Included escapement(), placeEscapement() and escapementWheel() in particular\r
\r
v2 - 2011 04 21\r
Added spokes() module, and used it in escapement() module\r
Updated escapement(), ringtooth(), tooth() and ring() modules to render better/faster in openCSG mode\r
\r
v3 - 2011 04 22\r
Renamed to clockworkLibrary\r
Added hand(), handNotch(), pinionWheel(), pinionEscapementWheel(), pinionDrum()\r
\r
v4 - 2011 04 29\r
Added negative space toggle to the parts, which defaults to false\r
Strengthened pinion teeth.\r
\r
v5 - 2011 05 01 \r
Added herringbone gear option, with a default value of 0\r
\r
v6 - 2011 05 04 \r
Changed how drum height in pinionDrum() is measured to work like sleeve extension does, to simplify placement math\r
Corrected error in how sleeve extension is measured in pinionWheel() (wheels are 2*thickness+1*spacer thick)\r
Changed how drum height in pinionEscapementWheel() is measured, to standardize\r
Create a drum() module, and implemeted flanges to keep the string from falling off\r
Retrofitted drum() into pinionDrum(), as well as for the spacer in pinionEscapementWheel() and pinionWheel()\r
\r
v7 - 2011 05 04 \r
Added an assymetric spacer so that the herringbone gears would mesh without running into the drum flanges\r
Switched to using mirror() to implement the two halves of the herringbone as a result\r
\r
v8 - 2011 05 06\r
Fixed a bug in spokes() which referenced the wrong spoke width parameter (thanks kitlaan!)\r
\r
v9 - 2011 05 07\r
Modified the escapement wheel profile to support club teeth (still defaults to ratchet teeth)\r
Club tooth parameters accessible in tooth(), ringtooth(), escapementWheel() and pinionEscapementWheel()\r
Modified escapement to control angle of impulse faces on the pallets, defaults to 45o as per ideal Graham escapement w/o club teeth\r
Escapement will work if impulse face angles are set to 45o minus tooth lean plus club angle, and drop can be controlled via face angle\r
\r
v10 -2011 05 08\r
Modified the drum() module to add holes to attach a string\r
Backwards compatible with no holes if the new arguments are not passed\r
Modified pinionDrum() to make use of this new feature, but backwards compatible with no holes if the new arguments are not passed\r
Summary of code changes:\r
https://github.com/syvwlch/Printable-Clock-Project/commit/04b645cd6fdbdcf74b8ed0ee9eb0a2f971e974f5\r
\r
v11 - 2011 05 18\r
Modified to support the ratcheting drum designed by rustedrobot: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8555\r
Backwards compatible, one-piece drum still available as an option\r
