function: "Made a little script that carves slices every 3mm (with a 1/2 mm gap) out of cylinder from which the clock's negative space has been removed via the difference() command.\r\n\r\nThe negative space is imported as an STL file, and was made using the new negative space feature of version 4 of the clockwork library.\r\n\r\nIncludes pre-visualization via the # debug modifier in OpenCSG mode (see jpg for example).\r\n\r\nIf there is some interest, I can clean up the code for the slicer and pack it up into a library?"
