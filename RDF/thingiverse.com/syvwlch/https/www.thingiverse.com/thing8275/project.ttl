    okh:function """This is the clock script for the current version of the test jig, which has been improved based on feedback from rustedrobot who printed out several iterations of the printable clock project, and several other makers on thingiverse with particular expertise on gears.\r
\r
Current development version to be found on git hub here:\r
github.com/syvwlch/Printable-Clock-Project\r
\r
It requires my clock builder script, which in turn requires the MCAD/involute_gear library and my clockwork library.\r
\r
Particular improvements include:\r
\r
1. herringbone gears, with suitable clearances.\r
2. no concentric shafts, no hands.\r
3. lowered pressure angle (14.5 degrees instead of 28).\r
4. minimum number of gears needed to test the escapement.\r
5. flanged drums on all wheels.\r
6. escapement/pendulum shares a shaft with the gear-train.\r
7. two-piece, connected frame to hold the shafts without applying pressure to the gear train.\r
8. thicker gears.\r
9. minimal sleeves to ensure clearance.\r
\r
(UPDATE: if run using the latest clock-builder script, the escapement wheel will use club teeth, which should print better than the original ratchet wheel (thanks ssd, for the feedback on the original one).\r
I have uploaded the two modified parts, the escapement wheel and the escapement, as parts 02b and 03b respectively. The rest are unchanged and do not need to be reprinted.)\r
\r
(UPDATE: the club-tooth version described above has been tested by TheRuttmeister and it passed all four tests! Major milestone. :-D We're going to work on mounting the string on the drum, rewinding it, and on a actual functional pendulum.)\r
\r
(UPDATE: rustedrobot has also printed out the club-tooth version and with some post-print fine-tuning, got it to run for two minutes powered by a weight on a string! Video here: http://www.prototribe.net/vidplay/testjig2.html )\r
\r
(UPDATE: improved back frame available, part 5b, which now includes countersunk hexagonal holes to hold the bolt heads and sit flush with the wall, as well as two wall mounting holes, same diameter as the bolts.)\r
\r
(UPDATE: added a version of the drum with holes for attaching string, part 1b)\r
\r
(UPDATE: part 03c is a variant of the escapement with increased drop, i.e. smaller impulse faces. The intent is to remove the need to shave the teeth before it works.)""" ;
