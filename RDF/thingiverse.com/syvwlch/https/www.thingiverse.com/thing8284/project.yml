function: "It took me next to forever, but since we still haven't gotten the test jig to tick, I guess I'm not that late. :-)\r\n\r\nHere is a clock script (intended to work with my clock builder script) for an 8 gear clock with hour, minute and second hands but with all the improvements we have currently made to the test jig... and an actual solid, connected frame that is composed of parts without any overhangs. I think this is revision D, but who's counting?"
