function: "When I saw WilliamAAdams' metal rail wall hanging system, I immediately thought of two little mods for it:\r\n1. A clip that could be added after installation, to add support without having to slip it on from one end of the rail.\r\n2. A support piece that leaves the top edge of the rail free, for something to slide along it without hitting anything short of the two extremities.\r\n\r\nIt's all OpenSCAD, so it didn't take much longer to think it than to do it, so that's what I went ahead and did.\r\n\r\nKudos to WilliamAAdams for writing such a clean code base, by the way!"
