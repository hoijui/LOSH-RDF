function: "Also known as Clock-in-a-Cage! \r\n\r\nWARNING! Since we still don't have a working escapement mechanism (see test jig #2 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8275 ), this is NOT a working clock, yet. Hopefully, it will be eventually. :-)\r\n\r\nThe Planetary Gearbox Clock is a collaboration with Emmett, who designed the original planetary gearbox and helped design and stack two of them with a 60:1 and 12:1 ratio respectively. I just slapped the escapement system on the back side and designed a cage-frame around it. The dove-tail snap-fit tabs for the cage I took from relet's excellent http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6214 .\r\n\r\nThe intent was to do away with concentric shafts altogether, by putting the entire gear-train inside the shaft, as it were. The frame must hold the stator rings without interfering with the hands that stick out the side of the rotor rings, hence the cage design."
