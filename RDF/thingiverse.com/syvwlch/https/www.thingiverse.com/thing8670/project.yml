function: "I was playing with extruding a changing shape, and this happened.\r\n\r\nIt's basically just two stacks of thin, skewed squares. It's surprising how much smoother the surface is if you twist the individual squares as you rotate them.\r\n\r\nThe layers are half a millimeter thick. The 40mm version is 40mm tall, and the 80mm version is, duh, 80mm tall.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Ran the 80mm version thru netfabb, which made it more than two thirds smaller."
