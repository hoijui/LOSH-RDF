When I looked at guru's original Volumetric Tentacle, I saw that indeed, he had used essentially the same methods but in Processing.\r\n\r\nSo I made a clone of his work, in OpenSCAD, just to show it could be done. OpenSCAD can do organic looking, there... you just have to be patient with the renders!"
