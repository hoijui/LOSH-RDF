function: "Renosis pointed out that all this extrude/transform OpenSCAD business would render a lot faster (and produce smaller files) if I played directly with polygons. He's right.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how far I can take this new line of inquiry, but for a simple triangle, I can now extrude it along Z while translating and rotating in in the X-Y plane. The seams always match up, it's the exact minimum number of faces, and you can control how smooth you want the object to be directly, kinda like the $fn system variable.\r\n\r\nThe results compile instantly and render in minutes instead of hours, even for high polycounts, the STLs are tiny (183 kB) and import just fine in OpenSCAD."
