function = "Extended the extrude/transform module so that the slices don't stay in the X-Y plane and are instead normal to the curve the extrusion follows.\r\n\r\nBranched out from sines to include a parabolic function, for the demo object, making a kind of rose or knot.\r\n\r\nThe 3D shape is a little complicated, so I decided to create a mild anaglyph of it. The gray-scale image can be enjoyed with the naked eye, but if you have a pair of blue/red glasses lying around, you can see it in 3D!"
