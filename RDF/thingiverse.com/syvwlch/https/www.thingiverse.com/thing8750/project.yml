function: "freakinhuge suggested that a module to generate screw threads would be a nice-to-have. This is a variation on my previous polygon extrude/transform module in which the triangle is in the X-Z plane rather than the X-Y plane.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to generate screw threads that follow any set of equations you care to provide them.\r\n\r\nAgain, because it generates the triangles directly via the polyhedron command, it's fast and lightweight.\r\n\r\nPS: the grayscale image is an anaglyph, look at it with red/blue glasses."
