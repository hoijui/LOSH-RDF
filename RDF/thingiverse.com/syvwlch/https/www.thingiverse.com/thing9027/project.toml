function = "Quick little OpenSCAD scrip to generate a roman emperor style coin or medal from a bust, using Bre's head as an example.  \n\n\n\nThe script is public domain, not Bre's head which I believe he still needs, from time to time. ;-)  \n\n\n\nUPDATE: Renosis printed one out!  \n\n\n\nUPDATE: Added another version that:  \n\na. Raises the profile up on a one millimeter ledge to make sure it generates several layers in Skeinforge before it starts to fill in the top.  \n\nb. Recesses the profile into the coin/medal, with a raised edge all around."
