function: "A Peabody Award to replace the one Colbert \"smashed\" when he didn't win a new one the following year. Same idea as this thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9085\r\n\r\nWikipedia quote: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colbert_Report#Awards\r\nIn April 2008, The Colbert Report received a George F. Peabody Award recognizing its excellence in news and entertainment.[80] This award was last seen being \"smashed\" by Colbert in anger because he had not won the Peabody Award once again.\r\n\r\nThis one is better because it has his own face on it, and if he smashes it, he can just print a new one. :-D"
