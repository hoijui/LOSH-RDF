function: "This is an icosahedron dome designed to be made with drinking straws or other hollow tubes (pipe, straw, bamboo etc.).\r\n\r\nThis is a minor derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26860\r\nA quick and dirty hack to use pins for hollow connectors like straws/pipes/bamboo\r\nSee the thingiverse page for instructions and \r\nhttp://desertdomes.com/pictures/dome/2vdiagram.gif\r\nfor assembly.\r\n\r\nLook out! If you print too many connectors you may find yourself under attack from alien pentacles and hexapods (see pics of the invasion i had to fight off). Hint: the one with the extended proboscis is the leader!"
