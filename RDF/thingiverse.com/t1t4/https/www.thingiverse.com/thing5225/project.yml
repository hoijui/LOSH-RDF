function: "I was looking for a Duplo helicopter for my nephew for Christmas but couldn't find one with just a helicopter so I made one. He's 3 so I wanted to keep it simple and only put 2x2 Duplo sized studs in the cockpit for a Duplo figure and made the rest kind of fisher-pricey. Works well with all the Duplo bricks I have tried with it so far. I was having some printing issues with larger objects so I also tried it at 1/2 scale which makes the studs regular lego size. I guess the printer isn't up to the tighter tolerances needed for lego because at this scale the lego parts are a bit hard to get on though they do work.\r\n\r\nI think of my self as an artist and not an engineer so the tolerances are less than great and it may have some pretty big design and structural issues. My 1:1 Duplo print mostly clicked together and holds without glue but I had to clean and sand some of the parts a little bit more than I would have liked to make it work. Had to really sand the holes for the rotors so they would spin freely. I printed these on my UP! with the normal and .25 mm settings. Maybe with fine and .20mm settings it would work a bit better?"
