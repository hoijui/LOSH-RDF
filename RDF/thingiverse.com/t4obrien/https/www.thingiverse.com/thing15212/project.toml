function = "Have you designed a tricopter, engineered a way to mount the rear servo to control yaw, then realized it's difficult to balance because of the heavy cantilevered servo and mount? I have. (check out my other projects)\r\n\r\nThis 3d-printed tricopter design moves the servo to the center and rotates the entire rear motor beam. Easy to print, easy to mount motors, easy to fly. \r\n\r\nI uploaded the solidworks source files too if you need to modify them to fit your servos or beams."
