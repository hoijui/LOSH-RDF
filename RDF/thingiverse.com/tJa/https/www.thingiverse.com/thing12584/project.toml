function = "Yet another case for the electronics.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a work in progress.\r\n\r\nMy take on this will be a screw-less assembly with optional mount for a fan.\r\n\r\nI will try to make it as parametric as possible.\r\n\r\n2011-10-20:\r\n\r\nI decided to upload the models done so far even though I have not yet verified printing them.\r\nImages of the parts will be uploaded as I have verified prints.\r\n\r\nI have yet to figure out a good way to design the top of the case.\r\nI want it to have openings for the stepper/term/endstop contacts so that they can be connected without opening the case but I'm not sure that will be easy to print as a single part. Suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nFiles intended for printing:\r\nbottom.scad : The bottom part of the case.\r\nsides.scad : The sides of the case.\r\nprinter_mount.scad : The MakerGear Prusa Mendel mount.\r\n\r\nFiles used by the printable models:\r\nparameters.scad : The parameters for the case. Used by all files.\r\nramps.scad : Layout of the electronics and used for alignment and cut-outs on the sides. Used in sides.scad\r\ngrid.scad : Helper module for creating a grid pattern. Used in bottom.scad and printer_mount.scad.\r\n\r\nOther files:\r\ncase.scad : The composite case. Mostly for illustration and alignment verification.\r\n\r\n2011-10-24:\r\n\r\nUploaded images of my first print and updated models somewhat due to alignment.\r\nChanges to the models include\r\n * positions and dimensions of the electronics\r\n * positions of the arduino mount plugs\r\n * dimension bottom part mount interface\r\n * corner plug hole height\r\nI had to widen the hole for the arduino USB contact as I was not able to slide the electronics into place.\r\nThe cross shaped opening on the bottom part had to be widened as it was not possible to attach the bottom part to the printer mount.\r\nThe corner plugs were too high to fit into the corner holes.\r\nThe plugs for the arduino board turned out too thin as they broke off - I will probably drill holes for nut-and-bolts."
