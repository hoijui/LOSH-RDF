\r
Please note that this is a work in progress.\r
\r
My take on this will be a screw-less assembly with optional mount for a fan.\r
\r
I will try to make it as parametric as possible.\r
\r
2011-10-20:\r
\r
I decided to upload the models done so far even though I have not yet verified printing them.\r
Images of the parts will be uploaded as I have verified prints.\r
\r
I have yet to figure out a good way to design the top of the case.\r
I want it to have openings for the stepper/term/endstop contacts so that they can be connected without opening the case but I'm not sure that will be easy to print as a single part. Suggestions welcome.\r
\r
Files intended for printing:\r
bottom.scad : The bottom part of the case.\r
sides.scad : The sides of the case.\r
printer_mount.scad : The MakerGear Prusa Mendel mount.\r
\r
Files used by the printable models:\r
parameters.scad : The parameters for the case. Used by all files.\r
ramps.scad : Layout of the electronics and used for alignment and cut-outs on the sides. Used in sides.scad\r
grid.scad : Helper module for creating a grid pattern. Used in bottom.scad and printer_mount.scad.\r
\r
Other files:\r
case.scad : The composite case. Mostly for illustration and alignment verification.\r
\r
2011-10-24:\r
\r
Uploaded images of my first print and updated models somewhat due to alignment.\r
Changes to the models include\r
 * positions and dimensions of the electronics\r
 * positions of the arduino mount plugs\r
 * dimension bottom part mount interface\r
 * corner plug hole height\r
I had to widen the hole for the arduino USB contact as I was not able to slide the electronics into place.\r
The cross shaped opening on the bottom part had to be widened as it was not possible to attach the bottom part to the printer mount.\r
The corner plugs were too high to fit into the corner holes.\r
The plugs for the arduino board turned out too thin as they broke off - I will probably drill holes for nut-and-bolts.""" ;
