function: "My friend needed an armature that his camera sight could latch onto. So I designed an armature for him. \r\n\r\nBut to make it really unique, I added the architectural styling found in Deus Ex Human Revolution. So when anyone sees this, they know it was custom and 3d-printed! \r\n\r\nThe most interesting result into this experiment, was that the trussed part appeared to perform better in Solidworks stress simulations, as compared to a part made from bulk material.\r\n\r\nThis explains why a lot of buildings these days are built with these organic-looking trusses, since you can actually tweak the macro-structure to support loads more effectively with less material."
