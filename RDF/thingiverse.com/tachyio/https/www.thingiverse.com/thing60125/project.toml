function = "The Microscopic Martian Mollusc is a muscular creatureâ€¦if you can call a microscopic animal muscular.\r\n\r\nThis little guy used to roam the seas of mars, when the planet was still youngâ€¦and global warming had not set in yet. \r\n\r\nIt's main food source was Crimson Krillâ€¦which are even smaller little creatures!\r\n\r\nIt's spiny exterior shell protects it from the larger predators, such as the vortex fish and the spiny aggregate (which was a large ball of spines that roamed near the bottom, with a great huge jaw for swallowing up the smaller creatures)\r\n\r\nThere are 6 flagella on its bottom which help in locomotion. If one is bitten off, another magically grows back."
