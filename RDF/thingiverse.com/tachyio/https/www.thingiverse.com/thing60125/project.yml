function: "The Microscopic Martian Mollusc is a muscular creature\xE2\u20AC\xA6if you can call a microscopic animal muscular.\r\n\r\nThis little guy used to roam the seas of mars, when the planet was still young\xE2\u20AC\xA6and global warming had not set in yet. \r\n\r\nIt's main food source was Crimson Krill\xE2\u20AC\xA6which are even smaller little creatures!\r\n\r\nIt's spiny exterior shell protects it from the larger predators, such as the vortex fish and the spiny aggregate (which was a large ball of spines that roamed near the bottom, with a great huge jaw for swallowing up the smaller creatures)\r\n\r\nThere are 6 flagella on its bottom which help in locomotion. If one is bitten off, another magically grows back."
