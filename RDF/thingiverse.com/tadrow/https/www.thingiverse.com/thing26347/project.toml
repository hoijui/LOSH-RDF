function = "A printable pulley for a NEMA 14 or 17 motor, using T5 belts, for use in a RepRap printer. Sized for a #6 SAE nut and setscrew, with the OpenSCAD file including the settings I used.\r\n\r\nBased on the T5 & XL Parametric Pulley by droftarts, Thing #11256. Created because it's a part that isn't included in the printed parts, and it seems like it should be.\r\n\r\nIf I can find the time, I'll add M3 and M4 variations, and size the captive nut slot for a nylock fastener to make the setscrew more secure (which was the idea behind the original from droftarts)."
