Someone smarter than me can use it to print the key at a higher infill, separate to the gears, which they might choose to print at a lower infill.  \r\n\r\nI printed my original plate at 30% (I think) infill, and the resultant key wasn't up to the task, although the gears printed with a high degree of awesomeness."
