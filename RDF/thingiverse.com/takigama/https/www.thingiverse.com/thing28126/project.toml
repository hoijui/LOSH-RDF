function = "WormStruder, as the name suggests is a worm drive based extruder. Takes design queues from Gregs and its derivatives, and utilises syvwlch Worm library for openscad. Uses a modified idler attachment without a screw (at the base). The body of this Extruder is around 15mm shorter (without motor) and 5mm narrower then a standard Gregs Accessible, but can use most of the same parts."
