function = "My first attempt at designing a bike bottle cage.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* a rubberband channel for reinforcement.\r\n* curved back meant to curve around a specific size of tube(customize .scad file to your bike)\r\n* The cage features precisely spaced bolt holes of proper depth(so the bolt head is flush with side of cage)\r\n\r\nThis revision of the bottle cage is plenty strong...the bottom support might be overbuilt :)"
