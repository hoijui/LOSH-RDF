\r
The Makerbot sounds musical as it builds, but I thought I'd pipe a midi in and see what happens. Others have done this before, but I wanted to have a go. I fixed an electronic violin tuner to the makerbot and then moved the feedrate slider to different points to get the notes. Then I hacked a Python script from here (http://tim.cexx.org/?p=633) to make the gcode. I'm just doing one channel right now for simplicity.\r
\r
In theory I could append the musical gcode to the end of the shape, but as different people have different Skeinforge settings, I thought I'd leave them separate.""" ;
