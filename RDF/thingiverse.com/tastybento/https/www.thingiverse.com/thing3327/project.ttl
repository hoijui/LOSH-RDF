UPDATE: We had lift off today (6/13/2010)!\r
\r
In order to make it blow, you need to make the rocket and base airtight. I\\'ve uploaded Rocket Base 2, which has a larger diameter than Base 1, which is too small. Once you've printed #2 out, use sandpaper to make it smooth and exactly the same size as your rocket "engine". In the end, I found that the rocket itself was airtight enough. Also, I think that using modeling clay to fill the holes works too.""" ;
