function: "This a CNC\\'ed 2\\\" plywood box. More test than practical.\r\n\r\nNow that my MakerBot is on order (Batch #7), I\\'m trying to think of accessories to add to it. Whatever they end up being, it\\'d be nice to make them match the MakerBot\\'s construction as much as practical. Since I don\\'t have a laser cutter handy, I thought I\\'d try a similar style construction using my CNC mill; this is the result.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial screws are just what I happened to have on hand. I plan to stock up on metric socket-head screws soon; any MakerBot accessories I publish will be metric."
