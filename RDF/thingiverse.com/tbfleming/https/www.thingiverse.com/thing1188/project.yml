function: "Replaced by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1652\r\n\r\nI got tired of manually untwisting filament while my MakerBot prints.  There are multple spindle designs on Thingiverse, but they all use laser-cut parts instead of printed parts.  I don't own a laser cutter, but I do own a MakerBot (#238), so I decided to design a spindle that can be printed.\r\n\r\nThis is the early result and somewhat flimsy.  I'm releasing it in its current form in the hope that it will be useful even though I don't consider it complete.  My to-do list includes tying the legs together and providing a way to prevent the filament from unspooling while it's not in use."
