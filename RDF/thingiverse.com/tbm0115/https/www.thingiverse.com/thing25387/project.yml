function: "A clip-on accessory for the Android X2. This accessory redirects sound from the speaker towards the user and has a collapsable stand.\r\nUpdate 08/09/2012: Just uploaded a new version. Haven't had a chance to print this one yet. Changes are rounded clips and extended along length of device and also the stand clasps onto a ring on the back.\r\nUpdate 10/16/2012: I slightly changed the design to increase the strength of the lower half as the stress of taking the phone out and back in repeatedly wore down the corners. Also made the clips loose so the phone slides into place instead of wearing on the side of the phone. Might make it a little bit tighter so the phone doesn't completely fall out."
