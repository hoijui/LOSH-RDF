function: "This is a derivative of the Keychain Pill Bottle that you can place an instrument reed into the cap, fill the bottle with water and screw the cap on (with reed) into the bottle. The idea is to help clean the reed and lightly soften the reed before playing.   \n\nEDIT: Do not leave your reed in this bottle for more than 1-2 minutes (thanks bigluc). Here's a link to proper reed care. I might try to update the design to accommodate some of the ideas in this article.  \n\nhttp://reedhelp.wordpress.com/tutorials/basiccare/"
