function = "Ok smarty, go to a party, yo Bust A Buser\r\n\r\nThis OpenSCAD script creates two parts - a stand with a customizable name text in 8bit font http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2054 and slices up a head scan and adds a pin connector slot http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10288  This way you can make the head super big to get more detail to show as well as avoid the overhang under the bust from causing problems.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, my bust is now modular so you can use pin connectors to attach it to other things.  You know you want to."
