function = "This one came out pretty well and is the most complete 360 degree gnome scan yet.  It was also the first scan using my new printed turntable and spinscan software from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9972\r\n\r\nSpinscan isn't calculating the Z axis correctly, so if you download the point cloud you'll see it was stretched.  I had to shrink the Z axis in blender.  Other then that and 2 steps in meshlab, it required no cleanup or merging of multiple point clouds, spinscan got a complete scan of all sides in one go."
