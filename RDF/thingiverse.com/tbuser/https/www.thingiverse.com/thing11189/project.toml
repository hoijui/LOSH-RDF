I'll be adding new bits and pieces to this over time.\r\n\r\nUses OpenSCAD so everything is parametric and hackable to make your own custom parts that snap together using all plastic pin connectors.\r\n\r\nIncludes a modified inline version of Parametric Makerbot M by br3ttb http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11105\r\n\r\nIt's a kind of evolution of my Mars Exploration Rover http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10057"
