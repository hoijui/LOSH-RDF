function: "This is the best quality scan I've been able to get out of spinscan so far.  I'm amazed that it picked up the texture in his beard because those indentations are barely 1mm deep.  The main issue now is with the right side of his body which I think is due to friction in my turntable causing some jerky rotation.\r\n\r\nScanned using Spinscan from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9972"
