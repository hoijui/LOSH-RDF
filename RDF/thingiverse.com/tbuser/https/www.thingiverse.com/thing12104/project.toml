Or if you just want a negative space object barcode to cut into another model.\r\n\r\nYou can encode the whole thingiverse url in your barcode, but the result will be pretty big.  Probably too large to stamp into another model.  However, you can just encode the Thingiverse thing number to get a pretty small code!\r\n\r\n1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix"
