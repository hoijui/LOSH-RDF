function = "Data Matrix bar code goes to my website tonybuser.com Picture shows top and bottom of single object printed simultaneously with dual extruders, no midprint filament color swapping.  \nData Matrix created with Data Matrix Dualstrusionator: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12104  \nFace and text/logo created in inkscape and converted to dxf using this process: http://tonybuser.com/2d-to-3d  \nYes, quality is a little rough at the moment with dual extrusion... but it's mostly a software problem to work out how best to keep nozzles from drooling between colors, skeinforge bugs with stl files with shapes inside shapes causing bad perimeter/infill, and there's a bug that causes the top layer not to print... That's why it's experimental - living on the edge!"
