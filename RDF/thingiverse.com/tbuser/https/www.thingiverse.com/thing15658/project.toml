function = "Supersized version of the dualstrusion two color world suitable for printing on a MakerBot Replicator.  145mm tall.  The inside is hollow to save plastic because it's so massive.  There's two versions, one totally hollow and one with a support column through the center which it turns out isn't really necessary."
