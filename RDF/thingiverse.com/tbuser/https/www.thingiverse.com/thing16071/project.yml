function: "With dual extruders on a ToM, there isn't much space for some of the other nice cooling fan shrouds like http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15430 So, this thing holds a 60mm wide fan out front and directs the air flow down under the nozzles pretty effectively.\r\n\r\nI also threw in an awesome-tastic r.Maker face.  :)\r\n\r\nIt works great, however I don't like how it obscures the view of the nozzles while it's printing.  So I might re-design it so the fan is vertical instead... but then I might lose that sweet r.Maker head...\r\n\r\nOptionally, you could just use the r.Maker head without the fan to add some style to your MakerBot and keep your fingers from hitting the extruder fans.\r\n\r\nHere's a before and after picture of how a cooling fan can improve print quality (especially with PLA): http://www.flickr.com/photos/tbuser/6709804997/"
