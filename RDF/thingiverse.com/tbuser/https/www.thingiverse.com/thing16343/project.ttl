    okh:function """While looking for new interesting things to print using water soluble PVA support, I decided I want to try to make a Hilbert Cube: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_cube\r
\r
After trying and failing to do it in openscad, I worked around it's limitations by writing a ruby script that generates openscad code.  This ruby script can create a 1-3 iterations of a hilbert curve in 3d.  I borrowed code from a Processing script by Thomas Diewald at http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=15599\r
\r
Unfortunately after doing this, I realized it wasn't really a hilbert cube as the shape is not one continuous curve. :(  Still it looks cool and is pretty much impossible to print without dissolvable support.  It would be awesome if someone smarter than me would make a proper parametric hilbert cube generator, plz!\r
\r
I also found a really nice and proper curved hilbert cube by Carlo H. SÃx83Â©quin at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sequin/X/Hilbert_Cube/ I resized it and made a support model for it.  I don't know what the license is on it, hopefully he won't mind me reposting it here.  The problem with this model is that it is curved in a way that makes it a more difficult print.\r
