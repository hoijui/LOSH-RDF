function = "Someone asked if ReconstructMe makes Spinscan obsolete.\r\n\r\nSo, I tried to get the best gnome scan I could using http://reconstructme.net so I could compare it with the best scan I've gotten using Spinscan http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9972\r\n\r\nCompare this scan with http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11506 and you can see that spinscan is much higher resolution.\r\n\r\nHowever, ReconstructMe is AWESOME for scanning large objects (like people) quickly even if it is at a lower resolution.\r\n\r\nFor scanning small things at high res, spinscan still wins."
