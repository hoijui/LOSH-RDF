function = "A negative space object that can be used to cut the connector shape into any object and turn it into a PEZ topper.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I just uploaded a new version that is a little wider and the tab holes a little bigger so that it snaps onto the pez dispenser much better.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2010-04-20: Added pez_maker.scad which uses the negative and adds a little structural components to make it easier to pezify oddly shaped heads."
