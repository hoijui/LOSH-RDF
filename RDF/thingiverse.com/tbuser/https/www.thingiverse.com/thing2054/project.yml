function: "Update: Added height map support\r\n\r\nThis is an OpenSCAD module that let's you easily (well kinda) create 3D text.  I've emulated the Atari 8-Bit fonts A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and most punctuation.  You can create them a letter at a time or pass an array of characters. (OpenSCAD doesn't have any real string manipulation)\r\n\r\nIt also has a bitmap module that you can use to define your own fonts.  It's pretty simple, you pass it an array of numbers (the number defines the height modifier, so a height of 5 and a value in array of 2 would make that pixel 10mm high), then tell it how many bits per row and it creates cubes (of configurable width and height) in a grid and combines them into a single shape.\r\n\r\nBe careful when defining your own bitmaps in that you can't have two bits only connected diagonally.  Otherwise OpenSCAD will say it's not manifold.  For instance you can't have:\r\n\r\n\r\n0 0 0\r\n0 1 0\r\n0 0 1\r\n\r\n\r\nBut you can have:\r\n\r\n\r\n0 0 0\r\n0 1 1\r\n0 0 1\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll try to keep this up to date, but you can always find the latest version on github at http://github.com/tbuser/openscad-bitmap"
