    okh:function "The handle part of my one screen door kind of wore down and the tip chipped off.  Consequently, it wouldn't stay shut.  Particularly since I put the screens in for spring and when one of my cats pushed against it to look outside - the door would pop open.  So I figured if the latch part was longer, it would catch better.  So I designed a replacement, printed it, and now it stays shut securely.  The old latch was also kind of hacked together with plates and spacers to make it fit.  Now my replacement is the perfect custom size.  MakerBot FTW!" ;
