function: "German (portions from Nuremberg or perhaps Augsburg)\r\nc.1520-1525\r\n\r\nStyle of armor named after the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\r\n\r\nScanned at the Reading Public Museum in Reading, PA using 123D Catch.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.readingpublicmuseum.org\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this scan isn't very good.  I couldn't go all the way around the back and people kept walking around.  I might go back later and try again."
