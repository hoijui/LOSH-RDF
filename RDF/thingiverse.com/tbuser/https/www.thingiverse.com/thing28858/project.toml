function = "Black Dynamite keeping the final frontier safe for all you space turkeys.\r\n\r\nAll plastic (including the spring), posable, and easily customizable. (make your own heads, arms, hands, weapons, jetpacks and snap them on)  If you have a Kinect, get ReconstructMe and make your own space marine bobblehead!\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress because a few of the parts still have some ugly overhangs that need more work, but it works as is.  The spring could also be shorter and the head bigger.\r\n\r\nVideo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/tbuser/7826022978/"
