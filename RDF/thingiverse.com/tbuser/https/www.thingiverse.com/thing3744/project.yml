function: This version has the mounting holes spaced for the standard Plastruder.  The mount hole spacing is now configurable in OpenSCAD so you can easily make one for the Printruder II if you want.  Also, I've made a few other tweaks to make it easier to fit the insulator, but might still need some cleanup to widen the slot so that it slides on for good alignment. (or you might need to play with the settings to increase/decrease the sizes)  The space around the clamp bolt holes has also been strengthened a little since it had a tendency to break and split open.
