function = "More efficient, quieter, and smoother than using the H-bridge hack on the GEN 3 extruder controller to drive a stepper based extruder and cheaper than using a full on stepper controller.  This simple Pololu stripboard will let you hook up a 1/16 microstepping stepper motor for under $20.  Even someone with my pathetic soldering skills can build one."
