function: "A group of us at the Berks CoLab hackerspace http://berkscolab.org decided we wanted to figure out how to do 3D scanning and this is the best result we've had so far.  \n\nIt was created with the Makerscanner software http://wiki.makerbot.com/makerscanner by hand (we didn't print out the Makerscanner mount yet) using a laser line level and a 1.3 megapixel Creative webcam."
