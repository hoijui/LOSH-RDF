function: "This nifty little programmable turntable that is part of a robotic arm kit was donated to my hackerspace - Berks CoLab http://berkscolab.org - and we've been using it for 360 degree 3D laser scanner experiments.  However it has a few problems - the large gear is slightly stripped and the table design is a pain because there's a giant hole in the center that makes it hard to sit objects in the center.\r\n\r\nI used the MCAD openscad library http://github.com/D1plo1d/MCAD to create a new gear that sort of works, but the teeth are tiny and I'm having trouble getting it to mesh well.  The cap I designed on the other hand works great and now I have a totally flat surface - yay MakerBotted!"
