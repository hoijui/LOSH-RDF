I fought the urge to unleash this abomination, but the moment the thought entered my mind, it twisted it's tendrils around my sanity until it had to be released.\r

This Great Old One is also a derivative of:\r

Sorry Bre.  It's all MakerBlock's fault.\r

btw: I had to Remesh Bre's head in MeshLab using the Uniform Mesh Resampling filter and I think removing non-manifold faces and vertexes and a few other things that I can't remember exactly in order to get OpenSCAD to process it right.  So the one positive thing about this awesomely disturbing creation is there is now a Bre head that can be remixed easily in OpenSCAD.""" ;
