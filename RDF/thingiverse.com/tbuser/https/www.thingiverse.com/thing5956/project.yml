function: "Beware! The full sight of Brethulhu in his native glory will sear your mind and leave you babbling and cursing in the dust at His feet.  I fought the urge to unleash this abomination, but the moment the thought entered my mind, it twisted it's tendrils around my sanity until it had to be released.\r\n\r\nThis Great Old One is also a derivative of:\r\n\r\n* Bre Pettis in 3D! - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3628\r\n* Thin Profile Whistle Blank - thingiverse.com/thing:5416\r\n* The Pink Panther Woman - thingiverse.com/thing:1216\r\n* Coin-op Bottle Opener - thingiverse.com/thing:1842\r\n* Nightmares\r\n\r\nSorry Bre.  It's all MakerBlock's fault.\r\n\r\nbtw: I had to Remesh Bre's head in MeshLab using the Uniform Mesh Resampling filter and I think removing non-manifold faces and vertexes and a few other things that I can't remember exactly in order to get OpenSCAD to process it right.  So the one positive thing about this awesomely disturbing creation is there is now a Bre head that can be remixed easily in OpenSCAD."
