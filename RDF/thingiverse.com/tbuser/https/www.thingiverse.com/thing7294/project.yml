function: "What's a bunnysta?  Half bunny, half gangsta, bred for its skills in magic.\r\n\r\nCreated with meshmixer http://meshmixer.com  I've also included a remeshed gangsta model as well as meshmixer obj/part files of his torso and legs that you can drop into your meshmixer part library to make your own mashups.\r\n\r\nAlso a derivative of flatfooted Stanford Bunny by phooky http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3731"
