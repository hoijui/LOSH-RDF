function: "This accomplishes a number of things...\r\n\r\nPulls the filament off of the spools at a constant, low resistance around a gentle arc at a fixed position and angle.  Without it, filament pulls off the side of the spool at an extreme tight angle causing the spool to bounce around during reversal and Z movement.\r\n\r\nYou don't need spool housings around the spool to keep the filament in place.  Since it's being pulled off at a fixed angle, the filament no longer has a tendency to fall off the side and get tangled.  It also doesn't unwrap when Z homes, the tube rises instead and the spool remains wrapped nicely tight. (which gets really bad when you stack a second spool on top)\r\n\r\nMakes switching between the 2 spools really easy since when you pull one out of the extruder, the tube holds the filament in place instead of spinning out of the spool and making a mess.\r\n\r\nProvides another place to stash your tools!"
