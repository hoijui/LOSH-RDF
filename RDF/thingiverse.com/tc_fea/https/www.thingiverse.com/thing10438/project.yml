function: "This is a mockup of the USS Fearless Interplanetary Explorer. Its purpose is to provide manned exploration to the Mars, Jupiter and beyond.\r\n\r\nIt will be assembled and launched from low earth orbit.\r\n\r\nThe xenon ion thrusters are low power producing only 0.001 G of thrust. However, the ship can transit to Mars in about a month since it will thrust continuously. The vehicle will accelerate continuously to the turnover point and then decelerate continuously to the in-system station point."
