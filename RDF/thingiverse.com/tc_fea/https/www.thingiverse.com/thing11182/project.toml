function = "This is a simplified miniature Taj Mahal.\r\n\r\nI recommend using the latest version of the .stl file: taj_mahal_110903e_ctr.stl.\r\n\r\nI modified the design to reduce thermal warping and use about 15% less plastic. I could not get the original file to print properly on my older cupcake due to thermal warping.\r\n\r\nThe picture shows the ...110903e file printed at 80% size. It printed in 2 hours and 2 min."
