function = "Due to variation in plastic spool sizes, I recommend that parts be trial fit before gluing to ensure that your spools fit easily.  \n\nUpdated 1.26.2013 to accommodate Solidoodle's new longer 2 lb spools of plastic (5 3/4\" long).  \n\nThis satisfied my need for a new spool holder sized to fit a small 2 lb filament spool. I also wanted it to be quick and easy to assemble.  \n\nThis design uses easy to cut PVC pipe and standard fittings available at my local hardware store. The PVC cement is quick drying for fast assembly.  \n\nThe only tool required is a hack saw."
