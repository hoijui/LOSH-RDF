function = "This is modification / derivative of stelocta 3219 by wootfish. I had trouble printing the original due to the thin bottom edge. So I created a 50 mm tall stelocta in AnsysEd, but truncated the bottom 4 mm.\r\n\r\n\"make_full_stelocta.mac\" is an ansys script to create the geometry of the full stelocta\r\n\r\nUPDATE: If you still have problems printing the version above, try \"stelocta_notched_100709.stl\" below. It has a notch in the bottom to break up the big bottom \"X\" layers which tend to curl up. See last two figures in white plastic."
