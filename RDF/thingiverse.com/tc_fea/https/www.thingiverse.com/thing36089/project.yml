function: "I have always been fascinated by the incredible complexity of the Benoit Mandelbrot set ever since I first saw it in the August 1985 issue of Scientific American.\r\n\r\nIt is a fractal that has incredible complexity no matter how close you zoom in on it. Unfortunately, I cannot do it justice with a 3D printer, but here is my attempt at it.\r\n\r\nThe rectangular layers are 0.6 mm tall which is appropriate for 0.3 mm layer height.\r\n\r\nfile: Mandelbrot_600_x_600.zip is 60 mm X 60 mm\r\n\r\nthe green and black photo is a two color print of the zipped .stl file.\r\n\r\nThe red and black photo is picture generated by the program I used to create the .stl."
