function = "This is a protector to prevent damage to the aileron servo arms on a T-28D Trojan RC airplane I recently purchased.\r\n\r\nI did not install the tricycle landing gear on the plane since I will land on grass most of the time. This exposed the aileron servos on the underside of the wing to damage during landing.\r\n\r\nThis is MakerBot at its best: need a part the manufacturer doesn't make, no problem design your own and print it."
