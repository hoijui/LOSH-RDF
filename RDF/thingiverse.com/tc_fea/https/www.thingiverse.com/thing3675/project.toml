function = "I recommend using http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:245340 instead since it looks nicer and prints better.  \n\nMy son suggested that I thin the walls of Trophy Cup thing: 3670 to make it print faster and use less plastic. This version does that.  \n\nRev 2: 1 hour vs 1 hour and 37 minutes.  \n\nRev 2: 17.5 grams vs 27.8 grams of plastic."
