function: "A fun little Christmas tree.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas tree shown has all 10 branches. However, the tree can be printed with fewer branches.\r\n\r\n12.16.2017 update adds a star to replace the top branch (branch 10) with star_171216b.stl\r\n\r\nThe 1.7.2016 update corrects issues with the .stl files that were noted by C_D.\r\nThe updated files were recreated in a later version of Sketchup and do not show any problems when checked by NetFabb"
