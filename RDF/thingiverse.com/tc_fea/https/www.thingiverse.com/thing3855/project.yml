function: "This was my answer to the need for a quick change spool for 1 lb coils of plastic. I like to frequently switch between colors. This spool lets me slip off the old coil and slip on a new coil. Its worked well with a 2+ hour print.\r\n\r\nIt really needs a larger bottom disk since the 1 lb coils tend to unwind. The largest round cake board my wife had was 16 inch, I think 20 inch might be enough."
