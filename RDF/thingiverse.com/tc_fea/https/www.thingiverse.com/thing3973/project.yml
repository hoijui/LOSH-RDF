function: "First off, I have not made or tested this. The dimensions etc are based on lessons learned from Poor Mans Quick Change Spindle thing 3855 which I did make and am currently using. I would prefer something slick looking like MakerBots spindle, so hopefully they will sell it or something.\r\n\r\nThis modification of MakerBots filament spindle allows quick change for 1 lb coils of plastic. 1 lb coils slip on and off easily without unscrewing anything. This is handy for me since I have half dozen colors of plastic and switch frequently.\r\n\r\nThe larger 20 inch bottom plate keeps the 1 lb coils from falling all over the place.\r\n\r\nThe design also allows use of 5 lb coils, but not quick change. Simply move the vertical pieces to the inner ring of slots.\r\n\r\n- This design shows an 8 inch round base plate which is more stable and less likely to tip than the 4 inch turn table bearing alone.\r\n- One person suggested a square base since it would make more efficient use of wood.\r\n- An even more efficient use of wood would be an X shape that picked up the turn table holes and the rubber feet.\r\n\r\nThe picture shows the poor mans spindle which works well except the 16 inch base should be larger.\r\n\r\nThe last image shows a 1/8 hole that can be used to lock the end of the plastic wire to the spindle if needed.\r\n\r\np.s. Zaggo added a ring of paper around his base plate to contain the coils of plastic that tend to uncoil. see thing: 3640, image:20072. This could reduce the required size of the base plate."
