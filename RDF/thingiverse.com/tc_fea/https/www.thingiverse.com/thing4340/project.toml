function = "A simulated tree. This is more in the fun with quasi-fractals genre. This prints more nicely than my original fractal tree thing:3373. No spaghetti is produced since each layer is a continuous path.\r\n\r\nThe \"branches\" and \"leaves\" are each 1.5 mm wide so they should print two strings of plastic thick.\r\n\r\nSee thing:4787 for .stl for roots similar to Zomboe's roots."
