function = "1/4/2012 update: added ghost_3_111218b_0.84mm.stl with 0.84mm thick wall for printing with thinner nozzles.\r\n\r\nThis is a little ghost toy. Print it in glow in the dark plastic or insert a small light.\r\n\r\nTest print is in blue. The first and last images are glow in the dark plastic.\r\n\r\nthis prints relatively quickly since the cape is 1.5 mm thick creating a 2 strand wall.\r\n\r\nfile: mk_ghost_2_101011b.mac creates the geometry in ANSYS classic."
