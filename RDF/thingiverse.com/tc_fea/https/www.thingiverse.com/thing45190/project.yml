function: "1.29.2017 update - repaired the .stl files after Zalntar noted their were numerous mesh errors. sorry for the problems.\r\n\r\nThis is an amateur version of a medical device called a goniometer, which can be used to measure range of motion in joints.  \r\n\r\nMy daughter broke both bones in her lower leg (tibia and fibula) and wanted to measure the progress she was making in physical therapy with the range of motion (flexing) in her knee. It was difficult to measure the angle of the knee joint with a standard protractor.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:\r\nThe midpoint of the circle on the goniometer is placed in the middle of the knee joint on the outside of the leg, and the arms are pointed toward the ankle and the hip.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA \"good range of motion\" in a normal patient is around a 120-130 degree angle, according to the physical therapist. Print yours and measure away!"
