It still seems fly about 40 to 50 feet with two linked rubber bands.\r\n\r\nfile: mk_flyer_rounded_101026a.mac is an ANSYS macro that will create the geometry for one airfoil, mesh it and then replicate to 360 degrees.\r\n\r\nthing:4421 has another ANSYS macro (ansys_2_stl_101012a.mac) that will convert the mesh to a .stl file."
