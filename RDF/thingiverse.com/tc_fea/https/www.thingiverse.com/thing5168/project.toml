(Tranlated to English: I had to replace the belt several times due to my screw-ups.)\r\n\r\nThe wooden snap fit slot holding the geared roller loosened to point where the motor gear would force the roller gear out of the slot and slip.\r\n\r\nThis simple paper clip fix has held up through 14 prints so far."
