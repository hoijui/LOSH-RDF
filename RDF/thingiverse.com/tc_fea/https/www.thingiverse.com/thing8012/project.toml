function = "This is a cube farm playset project to honor all of us who toil on in the corporate rat maze and keep America going.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to create something for this project, please add the tag: cube_farm so that we can find it and add it to our cube farm playset. I provided some dimensioned pictures for those who do not use Google Sketchup.\r\n\r\nI sorta plan to eventually add things like: computer monitor, keyboard, chair, wall clips etc. Or maybe I will add a laser cannon to zap noisy co-workers."
