- shreds my originals\r
- jams up beyond all possibility of repair\r
- very nicely accordions an 8 1/2 by 11 down to 8 1/2 by 1 (how does it do that?)\r
- is being used by some idiot copying the phone book, 100 copies of his kid's sports roster, etc\r
\r
I have included two .stl's, one with ears and one without ears for better printing.""" ;
