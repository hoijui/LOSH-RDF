function: "This is the evil copy machine that we all love to hate. Ours must have a built mood sensor since it always knows when I am a hurry, because that's when it always does one of the following:\r\n- shreds my originals\r\n- jams up beyond all possibility of repair\r\n- very nicely accordions an 8 1/2 by 11 down to 8 1/2 by 1 (how does it do that?)\r\n- is being used by some idiot copying the phone book, 100 copies of his kid's sports roster, etc\r\n\r\nI have included two .stl's, one with ears and one without ears for better printing."
