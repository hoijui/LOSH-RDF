function: "This is a nautilus shell split in half.\r\n\r\nI have included two .stl's, one is 1 mm thick walls and the other is 1.5 mm thick walls.\r\n\r\nI liked the 1 mm thick version but it did not print well on my cupcake with an MK5, maybe those with newer printers can print it cleanly.\r\n\r\nThe 1.5 mm thick version is shown in the top photo & last photo and printed much better on my setup."
