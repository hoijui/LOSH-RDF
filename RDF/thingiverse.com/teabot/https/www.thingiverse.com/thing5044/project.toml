function = "An enclosure for the Arduino and Ethernet shield that can be laser cut from sheet acrylic. Provides access to the USB port, DC jack, Ethernet port, SD card slot, reset button, and pin headers.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure is based on the standard Arduino enclosure:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5029\r\n\r\nIt has been resized and has additional port cut-outs. Furthermore, the hole for the rest button has been moved to align with the button on the Ethernet shield.\r\n\r\nThe case was designed using measurements from an Arduino Uno board and a Arduino Ethernet shield v5.\r\n\r\nMade at the London Hack Space:\r\nlondon.hackspace.org.uk/"
