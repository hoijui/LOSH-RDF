function = "Bring the heated bed of your Solidoodle up to temperature twice as fast with these parts, some sheet cork, and a little plywood or mdf.  Cork has good insulating properties and is relatively heat resistant.  This mechanism is designed to auto-retract, meaning that you can leave it unattended on the lowered bed and it will flip safely out of the way when the bed raises up to print."
