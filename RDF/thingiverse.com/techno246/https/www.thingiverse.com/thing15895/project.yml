function: "As cool as butterfly knives are (with all the tricks you can do), sadly, they are illegal in most places. Solution? Switch the knife for a comb! Now you can whip out your comb in style, maybe even pull off a few tricks before giving your hair that combing it needs. Best of all, it's printable from your 3d printer!\r\n\r\nVideo: http://youtu.be/DvH46YAMY3A\r\n\r\nEnjoy! :D\r\n\r\nWarning: Design is in beta. Will hopefully get around to improving the design for better assembly and function."
