function = "Adjusted the parameters for my 67mm lens cap and the 25mm wide portion of the BlackRapid R-Strap. I've also split the buckle portion to make it possible to clip the holder to the strap rather than feed it through the buckle (The R-Strap has a clip on the free end which makes it impossible to slide on). \r\n\r\nI haven't stress tested the buckle, but it seems pretty secure."
