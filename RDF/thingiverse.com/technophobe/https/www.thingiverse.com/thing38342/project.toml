function = "This is a mold for replacement rubber feet such as used on my Kinesis Advantage keyboard. My keyboard was missing one of it's feet which keep it from sliding around the desk. Without this foot the keyboard was not stableâ€”it would rock left-right.\r\n\r\nThis mold was designed to be used with sugru silicone rubber.\r\n\r\nThis thing includes the original, positive model and a 4-up mold created using that model (in Blender)."
