http://www.emakershop.com/forum?vasthtmlaction=viewtopic&t=276\r
\r
IMHO, it's not if but when the bed will fail. I decided to design my own replacement bed for the Emaker Huxleys despite already ordering the ReprapPro Huxley's PCB bed.\r
\r
Reason being that the PCB bed is not a drop-in replacement for the Emaker Huxleys. Changes to the Y-axis is required and the thermistor tables are different too.\r
\r
This bed is designed to be a drop-in replacement and has a larger build area that will allow actual printing of the promised 140mm x 140mm area.\r
\r
One of the problem when coming up with the design is determining the resistor to use. Indeed there seems to be no guide to this. For my case, I used my rusty electronics knowledge and some guesswork.\r
\r
First, determine the power wattage for the bed. 90-100W seems like a safe bet, and since the Emaker Huxley's power adapter is only rated to 120W (19V). It's best to give some allowance. Obviously, if your bed is huge or uses a thicker aluminum, you have to compensate for that.\r
\r
So current, I = 90W / 19V = 4.74A\r
\r
Resistance, R = 19V / 4.74A = 4ohms\r
\r
I decided to use 6 x 15W resistors to spread the heat more evenly, but I believe 4 x 25W will work too. So roughly 4ohms / 6 = 0.66ohms each.\r

\r
I also got some high-temp hook up wires.\r

\r
You can use back the original thermistors that came with the kit but just for reference, it's this one.\r
