function = "I've been making action figures lately (see http://tekeian.posterous.com/pages/action-figures). Here is a version for Thingiverse.\r\n\r\nI've printed 80 action figures of various designs. One of the goals is a quick finish and assembly time. Only a flat file and an X-Acto knife are needed for raft trimming, then glue it up.\r\n\r\nThe arms can be articulated by gluing some filament to each arm and running them through the hole in the body.\r\n\r\nThe hands (or claws) can hold objects with a ~3mm edge."
