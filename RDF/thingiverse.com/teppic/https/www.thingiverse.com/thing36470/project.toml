Try it out!***  \n\n---  \n\nThis is my Slic3r settings for Thing-O-Matic, including a postprocessing script to create the correct extrusion commands.  \n\nThese settings works great for me, although I haven't really measured and calibrated the result yet. Feel free to share your experience and improvements!  \n\nFiles are also available in this gist:  \nhttps://gist.github.com/4250182"
