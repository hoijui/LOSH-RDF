function = "The little halfmoon shape thingi that is supposed to hold the bridge for the beginning of the hinge was seriously getting on my nerves, I mean really! yes Really! five prints that thing keeps getting unstuck. also the sharp corner holding the bearing tended to curl up a bit. So I thought time to do something about it!. IOtherwise it's just like the greg's guildler just cut the stuff off when the print is done, I might adjust this a little bit right now it's being held by the main body maybe a bit much, After some test prints I might adjust it a bit, but the bridge is already done on my first print I just dunno how serious the cutting will be wastes less plastic than a full raft I will adjust on the fly and might not mention it till finalized"
