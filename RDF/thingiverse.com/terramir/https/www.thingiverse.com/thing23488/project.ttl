So I thought time to do something about it!. IOtherwise it's just like the greg's guildler just cut the stuff off when the print is done, I might adjust this a little bit right now it's being held by the main body maybe a bit much, After some test prints I might adjust it a bit, but the bridge is already done on my first print I just dunno how serious the cutting will be wastes less plastic than a full raft I will adjust on the fly and might not mention it till finalized" ;
