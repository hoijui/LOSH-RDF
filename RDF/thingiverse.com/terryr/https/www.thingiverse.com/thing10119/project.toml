function = "The 2008 TV Series â€œFringeâ€x9d contains glyphs (pictures) between commercials that provide insights into each episode. This is a decoder ring that allows those glyphs to be decoded. \r\n\r\nThe translation of the glyphs into specific characters has been provided by other fans of the show on the net. I simply created this decoder ring based on that information. \r\n\r\nEach glyph contains a picture and a bright yellow dot and corresponds to a single letter of the alphabet. To decode a picture, align the two rings so the description of the picture is visible, and then select the hole that corresponds with the position of the dot.  For example, a picture of a hand with a dot in the upper left corner would correspond to the letter â€œXâ€x9d.\r\n\r\nEnjoy."
