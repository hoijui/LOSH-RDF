function: "Here is a printable model of a horse called \xE2\u20AC\u02DCsin\xE2\u20AC\u2122 from Google\xE2\u20AC\u2122s 3D warehouse.  The trick for me was finding a way to divide the horse so that overhangs were minimized.\r\n \r\nI used Sketchup to divide the original model. This horse prints reasonably well on my TOM. \r\n\r\nThis model is about 50 mm tall and 80 mm long after printing and assembling."
