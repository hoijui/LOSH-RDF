function = "We have a pole that allows us to reach our attic ladder, and I wanted to create a bracket so I could mount the pole inside a closet. The pole is roughly 31 mm in diameter.\r\n\r\nI designed the bracket from scratch using Sketchup.\r\n\r\nI added supports to the arms to assist in printing. Once printed, these break away easily."
