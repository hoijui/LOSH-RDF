function: "this is a work in progress. i will p=be posting up the files as as they are finalized so that the community as a whole can work together to further develop this concept. \r\n\r\nthis system has 1 NEMA 17 stepper motor as a direct drive motor and 2 pull solenoids providing pressure against the filaments. each solenoid has a delrin block attached and a spring to provide pressure when a solenoid is retracted the other engages pushing the other filament into the drive gear."
