function = "This thing was revised on May 24, 2014. The revision added a 0.5mm thick surface to the clamping face of the part. The interior remains hollow. The older .STL file has been deleted and replaced with the revised version.  \r\n\r\nThe \"Super Clamp\" (manufactured by Manfrotto, et al.), is widely used by photographers and stage hands for mounting cameras, lights, audio and other equipment. A triangular insert is supplied with the Super Clamp. The insert is used when clamping to a flat support, such as a board, etc., however, these inserts are easily lost. Here's a replacement for the Super Clamp insert.   \r\n\r\nAlthough this part doesn't look exactly like the original, it is perfectly functional. I printed in PLA, but ABS will work just fine."
