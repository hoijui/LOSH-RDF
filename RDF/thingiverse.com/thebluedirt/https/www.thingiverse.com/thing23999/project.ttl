    okh:function """This buckle,combined with a belt material (I used woven paracord), will produce a nice looking belt with two awesome properties:  



(1) Guaranteed not to set off metal detectors  



(2) Can be used in an emergency to provide almost 50 feet of high-strength para-cord!  



The buckle features a single-print, two-piece design.  The buckle works like any typical one, but prints the part already assembled.  



The design also features a space for personalization (initials, etc).  The version depicted was personalized for my father-- the files provide are the 'vanilla' part.  



STEP file is provided for those who would like to personalize.  



Makes a great father's day present! Enjoy!""" ;
