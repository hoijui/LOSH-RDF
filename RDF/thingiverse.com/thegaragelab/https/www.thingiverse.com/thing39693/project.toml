function = "A very simple thing you can clip a PCB into and keep it safe from accidental shorts or mount onto a more permanent fixture.\r\n\r\nInspired by things 24096 (the Raspberry Pi plate) and 32201 (XClip for Raspberry Pi) this one is a bit more applicable for lower resolution (0.3mm or higher) prints and far more functional than aesthetic.\r\n\r\nIt also has the benefit of being parametric."
