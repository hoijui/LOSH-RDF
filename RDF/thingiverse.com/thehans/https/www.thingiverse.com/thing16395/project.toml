function = "This is the same model as the original, only with a filesize about 1/100th.  The original had an absurd number of vertices (64000 or something like that) for such a relatively simple shape.  I decimated the mesh using meshlab and came up with this.    \r\n\r\nWith the old model I could not slice it, all my RAM was used up and it sat there for hours.  Now it slices in a minute."
