function: "this is the very first thing i did with openscad when i was just learning how to use it,\r\nit's a simple horizontal bearing holder when you load it into openscad it's fairly obvious by the variable names how to manipulate to get the bearing size and bolt spacing you need \r\n\r\nwhen i get time i intend to re-write it for even greater flexability eg change the shape of the block amount of holes"
