function: "I really love the camera sliders that are built with extruded aluminum.  Most of the ones I've seen are part of larger, more complicated designs, meant to be belt driven or requiring special hardware.\r\n\r\nHaving leftover aluminum pieces from a build, I designed this simple bracket to mount the piece to a surface.\r\n\r\nThis is not for steady video dolly-style effects.  This is really just to be able to change one axis for a still camera."
