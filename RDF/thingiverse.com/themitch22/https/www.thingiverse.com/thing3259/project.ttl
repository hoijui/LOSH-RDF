\r
This is my first design so be nice. This is planned to be built in one piece on a Makerbot. I don't have a HBP so I think this print is too big to print without warping. I tried to account for the 100mmx100mm limitations and I don't think the overhangs are severe. Feel free to give me suggestions of changes for printing.""" ;
