function = "Well since I fixed my chair with my Makerbot, I decided to fix something else that was bothering me. I lost a tab for my Razer Lycosa keyboard a while ago so I could only have it laying flat, which isn't good for my wrists.\r\n\r\nI took the other tab and measured it with my calipers and started designing a part in Sketchup. I got the basic design down and the pegs that stick out I added a small support so it would be printable. \r\n\r\nI printed it out and it matches exactly to the other tab except I had to use a Dremel sander bit to make the peg a little smaller since I couldn't print it close enough. \r\n\r\nIt snaps in place like the other tab and now I can enjoy my keyboard raised!"
