\r
I took the other tab and measured it with my calipers and started designing a part in Sketchup. I got the basic design down and the pegs that stick out I added a small support so it would be printable. \r
\r
I printed it out and it matches exactly to the other tab except I had to use a Dremel sander bit to make the peg a little smaller since I couldn't print it close enough. \r
\r
It snaps in place like the other tab and now I can enjoy my keyboard raised!""" ;
