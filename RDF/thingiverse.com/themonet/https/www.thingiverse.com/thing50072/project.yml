function: I was tired of having my backup hard drive sitting on my desk.  So I designed this cradle that connects to the metal stand of my (2006) iMac and holds the hard drive behind the screen.  I decided that making it look like a mustachioed man with glasses was the perfect look for my hard drive.  He's just a know it all with a perfect memory.
