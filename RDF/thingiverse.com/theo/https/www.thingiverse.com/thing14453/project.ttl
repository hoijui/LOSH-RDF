The Makerbot was printing and surrounded by this sweet smell of melted plastic it inspired us to draw these. \r
\r
apple, archlinux, floppydisk, openhardware, pacman, twitter; not every shape is easy to print, and not every shape can become a cookie. Those shapes were chosen for their printability (sometimes), and of course their level of geekiness !\r
\r
Ideal for Christmas gift.\r
\r
Enjoy printing, cooking and eating - you greedy fellaz !""" ;
