function: "Ultra \xC3\xBCber geek fantomie and I made these cookie cutters one night on top of a mountain, 2km high.\r\nThe Makerbot was printing and surrounded by this sweet smell of melted plastic it inspired us to draw these. \r\n\r\napple, archlinux, floppydisk, openhardware, pacman, twitter; not every shape is easy to print, and not every shape can become a cookie. Those shapes were chosen for their printability (sometimes), and of course their level of geekiness !\r\n\r\nIdeal for Christmas gift.\r\n\r\nEnjoy printing, cooking and eating - you greedy fellaz !"
