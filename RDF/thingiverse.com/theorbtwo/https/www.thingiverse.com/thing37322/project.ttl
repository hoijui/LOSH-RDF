\r
For the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, the festival of lights, one traditionally lights candles for eight days -- one on the first day, two on the second, etc, using a ninth candle, called the shamash.  A device called a Menorah is used to hold the candles, and to keep the shamash seperate.  (The shamash isn't one of the holy candles, but rather is there so you have an excuse when you use the light of the menorah for mundane tasks, instead of studying and spreading the story of Hanukkah.)""" ;
