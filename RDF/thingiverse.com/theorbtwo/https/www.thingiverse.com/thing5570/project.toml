So, an experiment, jam a coloured marker in the feedstock\r\ninlet and see what happens. What happened was, coloured prints came\r\nout. So the idea for the marker organ was born, a way to attached\r\nseveral coloured markers to the feedstock, and pick which one, or\r\ncombination, is colouring the plastic.\r\n\r\nThis is the first attempt, a simple clamp over the feedstock which\r\nholds a single marker against it."
