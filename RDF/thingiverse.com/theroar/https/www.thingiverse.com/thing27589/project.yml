function: A hardware store had plastic stakes for tomato fencing and such. 2.50 each, but the clips did not match the fence I bought. I made this clip to work with a furring strip. They are cheap and I had the spikes from a tree house project for the kids.  I used a few zip ties to hold the fence what I wanted. Tomatoes are now growing up... not out. =)
