function: "This is a house that I created. I have a module where 8th graders learn Google sketchup. One of their final lessons is to pick up a physical object and make a exact copy in sketchup.\r\n\r\nI think the sweetest part of the lesson is that I have them use the dimension tool to prove that the build is accurate. Super easy way for me to gauge success and them to learn to use the tool. =)"
