function: "A version of my lighthouse created in OpenSCAD. \r\n\r\nAdded a version LH2. Just added some labels to help if you are changing it. I also hollowed out the tower and figured out how to make more post for the top of the lighthouse as well. Whoever made the code for example 5, it is pretty sweet and easily adaptable!"
