function: "A super simple thing that I was surprised wasn't already here.\r\n\r\nSpool clamps are used by luthiers to build violins and other stringed instruments. Typically they're made from a hardwood dowel with a threaded rod trilled through the center, with cork or leather lining the jaws.  They're great for clamping the edge of things without having to worry about the orientation of the clamp.\r\n\r\nThey cost about $4 each at a luthier supplier, which doesn't seem too much but you really need a couple dozen of them for any real project, and that starts to add up quickly.  Everyone says that it isn't any cheaper to make your own, but I figure plywood disks and carriage bolts are cheaper than that.  And I have a project I can use them on.\r\n\r\nTwo 1\" disks.  One has a 0.26\" hole in it for a 1/4\" bolt.  The other has a 0.26\" square to fit the square end of a carriage bolt.  I'm providing the OpenSCAD script and DXF files for each disk."
