function = "I liked MrJohn's Nickel Calibration Test (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11215) but I wanted to use a larger coin, like a Golden Dollar.  Also, it's a very simple thing so I figured a an OpenSCAD version was in order.\r\n\r\nIt's parameterized with adjustable amount of outer margin and slop around the coin.\r\n\r\nI've also created a STL file for a dollar coin."
