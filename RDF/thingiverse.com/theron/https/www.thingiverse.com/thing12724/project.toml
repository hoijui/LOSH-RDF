function = "We use fellow crasher Jerry Isdale's 3D Logo (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1770) for give-aways and for the monthly MakerBot 101 class at CRASHspace.  I was trying to make a pyramid with it in OpenSCAD, but it wasn't rendering right because some of the normals are flipped.  So I fixed it in MeshLab.  The original prints just fine, so this isn't necessarily a replacement.  But you may need this to create any derivatives."
