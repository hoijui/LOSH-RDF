function = "Everybody needs a Mickey Mouse hat, including Walt Disney. This should be sized for the full-sized Walt Disney's Head (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:751).  I printed it at 75% (45 mm inner diameter) because that's how big I printed the head.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty parametric so you can make it whatever size you need."
