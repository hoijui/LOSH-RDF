function = "An idea for a corner gluing clamp brace.  Using two, you can hold three pieces of material into a corner with clamps.  The edges are chamfered on the outside and there is a groove on the inside to keep the braces away from the joint (and glue).  There are holes in the sides for spool clamps (such as http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10448)."
