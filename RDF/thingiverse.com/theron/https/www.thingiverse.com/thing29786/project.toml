function = "I have cabinets in my bathroom that were made by Ikea.  I got some cool feet that screwed on to the bottom.  We re-did the bathroom and put in title, but that meant that the legs were now just a bit too long.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they don't make the cabinets or feet any more, I don't think.  I don't want to throw away my cabinets just because the feet are an inch too long.\r\n\r\nSo I modeled up feet that slip on over the threaded rod (no threads - might be in version 3).  And this way we get a choice of colors!"
