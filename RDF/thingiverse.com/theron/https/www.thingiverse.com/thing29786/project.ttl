\r
Unfortunately, they don't make the cabinets or feet any more, I don't think.  I don't want to throw away my cabinets just because the feet are an inch too long.\r
\r
So I modeled up feet that slip on over the threaded rod (no threads - might be in version 3).  And this way we get a choice of colors!""" ;
