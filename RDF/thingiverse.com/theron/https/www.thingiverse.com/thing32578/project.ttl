    okh:function """This is a collaboration with Tim Pool http://timcast.com and Geoff Shively twitter.com/Jiraffa. They use 3G hotspots for live video streaming and they often overheat and stop working, so they wanted some way to cool the hotspot.\r
\r
So we sat down and designed this thing in less than an hour and printed it out for testing the next day.  Rapid prototyping FTW!\r
\r
This thing is a holder which allows you to attach a standard 80mm computer fan to the hotspot for cooling.\r
\r
The prototype has been used covering both the Republican and Democratic national conventions during  the heat of summer and seems to work pretty well.\r
\r
A few notes:\r
\r
The grid on the bottom doesn't need to be so tight, and only serves to block airflow. My next revision will make fewer larger holes. The grid doesn't actually need to be there at all unless you need to protect the hotspot from foreign objects.\r
\r
The smaller holes in the middle of each side were intended for a setscrew to hold the hotspot in place, but I don't think they're necessary.  You can hold it all together with tape or rubber bands.\r
\r
Most everything is adjustable in the OpenSCAD file, but has not been tested for extreme values.""" ;
