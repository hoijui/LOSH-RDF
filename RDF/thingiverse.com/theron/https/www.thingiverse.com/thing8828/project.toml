function = "I wanted to make a bar that had different thicknesses.  This OpenSCAD script lets you set a starting thickness and step size for four different sizes.  The length of the bar is also definable.  The uploaded script has 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm steps in a 50mm long bar.\r\n\r\nMight also make a good test object as you know five dimensions."
