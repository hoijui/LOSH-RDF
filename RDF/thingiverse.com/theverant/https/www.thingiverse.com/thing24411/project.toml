function = "weatherproof enclosure for home rolled cables with VGA connectors.  I'm using these to connect sensors to central reporting node.\r\n\r\nIt uses 4-40 screws to hold enclosure together.  I may go with a clip system in the future so no external parts are reuired.\r\n\r\nStill testing whether this works or not!  (pun intended)\r\n\r\nSketchup file will be added at later date, as will finished product."
