function: "This is a very small mecanum wheel - 1\" in diameter.  Most mecanum designs use a central hub with vanes style but I found that these designs didn't print well on my TOM as there isn't much support structure for the vanes.  This is a first attempt at a design with more \"meat\" to hopefully get a better print.  I've also included the original rhino file.\r\n\r\nSo far this is just one of the mono-directional wheels."
