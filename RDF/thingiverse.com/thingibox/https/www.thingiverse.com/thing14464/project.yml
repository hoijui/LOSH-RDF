function: "Amazed by the extra-rigid piece of aluminium and the extremely limited heated build platform 1.0 of my Cupcake, I decided to buy the Thing-o-matic HBP and then adapt it to my printer.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of strange designs came to my mind, and finally I got what I think was the most simple and effective solution: printing 4 extra corners and use one of the wood platforms used for the X stage of the printer.\r\n\r\nWhat will you get?\r\n\r\n- An extra plain build surface\r\n- Forgot about the aluminium sticker\r\n- More uniform temperature distribution\r\n- Improved build size\r\n\r\nOf course, this mod is compatible with the amazing XY lowrider by twotimes!"
