function: "This set of parts combines with three M3 screws and 2 M4 x 60mm (minimum length 50mm) pan-head screws to provide a mount for a Wade adapter and hot-end. In this adaptation the hot-end is held in place by a front insert piece that presses against the hot-end.  \n\nThis set now includes 3 different options for hot-end mounting. The \"groove_mount\" option is the standard straight groove, which defaults to 3mm long and 1.45mm deep. The \"noscrew_mount\" option provides a screwless groove-style mount for a hot-end with a V-shaped groove that usually mounts with two screws through the extruder body. The \"screw_mount\" option just provides a straight hole for hot ends that are secured to the extruder.  \n\nThis set also includes the original \"mini\" x-carriage for reference, and a newer design x-carriage modified to have the same mounting as the inverted mini x-carriage. A two-piece hinged arm is also included which you can use to attach a 40mm fan or other accessory to the front of the carriage.  \n\nThe SCAD files are included so you can modify these parts to fit your own hardware and preferences. See _configuration.scad_ for tunable parameters."
