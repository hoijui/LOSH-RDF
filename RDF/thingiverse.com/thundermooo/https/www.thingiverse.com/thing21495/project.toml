function = "This project that creates a chair from the shape of soap bubbles has recently been posted to Kickstarter. A soap bubble evenly distributes curvature throughout its shape, but at the same time equally distributes the structural forces as well. If you could harness this property for a structural system, you could use recycled materials and yield the same strength as high performance steel. \r\n\r\nAnyone who would like is welcome to print the file for themselves, but the model was created to be a reward for my kickstarter. Please take a look and contribute if you want to help out. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748240161/soap-bubble-chair\r\n\r\nHave a look at my website for more informational slide decks and videos that detail the ideas behind using the shape of a soap bubble in architecture and industrial design. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.mSurfaces.com"
