    okh:function """Using the same logic that created the soap bubble chair, I created a double sided vase whose shape could be formed with soap bubbles. A soap bubble evenly distributes curvature throughout its shape, but at the same time equally distributes the structural forces as well. If you could harness this property for a structural system, you could use recycled materials and yield the same strength as high performance steel.\r
\r
I recently posted a Kickstarter campaign to support plan to build a real chair that uses these concepts. Please enjoy the soap bubble chair model posted earlier to Thingiverse, and I would encourage everyone who can to pledge a contribution on Kickstarter. My goal is to get 250 people to pledge $40. \r

In the coming days and weeks I'll be posting more things that use these shaping techniques, so check back and enjoy. Or just follow me on Twitter at @mSurfaces for the announcements.""" ;
