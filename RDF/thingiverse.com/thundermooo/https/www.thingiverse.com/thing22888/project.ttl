\r
My project that creates a chair from the shape of soap bubbles has recently been posted to Kickstarter. A soap bubble evenly distributes curvature throughout its shape, but at the same time equally distributes the structural forces as well. If you could harness this property for a structural system, you could use recycled materials and yield the same strength as high performance steel. This model depicts the chair's shape with actual soap bubbles, rather than in a solid print\r
\r
Anyone who would like is welcome to print the file for themselves, but the model was created to be a reward for my kickstarter. Please take a look and contribute if you want to help out.\r

Have a look at my website for more informational slide decks and videos that detail the ideas behind using the shape of a soap bubble in architecture and industrial design.\r
