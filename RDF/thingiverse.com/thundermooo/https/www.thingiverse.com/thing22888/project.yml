function: "This model is a subsequent design based upon the earlier posted model, 'Soap Bubble Chair':\t\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21495\r\n\r\nMy project that creates a chair from the shape of soap bubbles has recently been posted to Kickstarter. A soap bubble evenly distributes curvature throughout its shape, but at the same time equally distributes the structural forces as well. If you could harness this property for a structural system, you could use recycled materials and yield the same strength as high performance steel. This model depicts the chair's shape with actual soap bubbles, rather than in a solid print\r\n\r\nAnyone who would like is welcome to print the file for themselves, but the model was created to be a reward for my kickstarter. Please take a look and contribute if you want to help out.\r\n\r\nkickstarter.com/projects/1748240161/soap-bubble-chair\r\n\r\nHave a look at my website for more informational slide decks and videos that detail the ideas behind using the shape of a soap bubble in architecture and industrial design.\r\n\r\nmSurfaces.com"
