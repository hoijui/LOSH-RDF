function = "This is a adapter to fit standard exhaust hoses to the Full Spectrum 40W Hobby Laser and the HPC LS3020 Laser Cutter. It might probably fit a few other laser cutters from China as well.\r\n\r\nThe standard exhaust fans that come with these lasercutters are not all that great. They are inefficient, leaky, have a non-standard hose fitting, and block access to the back laser compartment. This adapter allows you to fit a standard exhaust hose to the laser, which can then be connected to some proper air filtration equipment.\r\n\r\nIt was created by Alexander Brock in the RaumZeitLabor hackerspace in Mannheim, Germany, for their FS laser cutter."
