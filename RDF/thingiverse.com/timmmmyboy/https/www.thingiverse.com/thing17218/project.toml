function = "I suppose I'll always remember that Perry was my very first....thing. This is actually a scan that I did using 123D. Check this blog post for details on how that was done: http://makerbot.umwblogs.org/3d-scanning-from-photographs-with-123d-catch\r\n\r\nI'm pretty pleased with how it turned out but would love to know more on how to give it a flat bed to sit on and remove the makeshift ramp that was left from the table being included in the scan. I've included the .obj file that I got from the software and the only editing I did was removing the extra furniture and parts of the table in Meshmixer (very new to this).\r\n\r\nIn any case you can print your own Perry and keep him close. If you do I'd love to see a picture of him in your natural habitat!\r\n\r\nUpdate: Thanks to Landru I've put the updated version of Perry on here with smoother polygons and a flat bottom."
