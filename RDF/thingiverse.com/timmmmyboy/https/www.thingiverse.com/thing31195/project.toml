Using the Sketchup file at http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-create-your-own-3D-Printed-iPhone-Case-from/ I added the logo and other design elements. For reference this is the iPhone 4 GSM model. My understanding is this should also fit the 4S GSM model (I hope so anyway, that's the phone I have) Doh! Turns out the CDMA version of the iPhone 4 is the one that matches the 4S. I've now added both the 4 (GSM) and 4S (which is also CDMA 4) as separate downloads."
