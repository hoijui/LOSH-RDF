function = "Turn the unused keyholes in boltless shelves into practical hanging space.\r\n\r\nUsing 2 keyholes in the uprights this thing sits and provides a hook for things like scissors, headphones (I use 2 half shelves and a laminated MDF as a PC desk, huge desktop), pots and pans and a whole thingiverse of items.\r\n\r\nMake your own custom 3d prints that are held up with this print.\r\n\r\nYes itâ€™s completely parametric so it will work with any brand of keyhole style boltless shelves\r\n\r\nThe bridge in the model might sag, as long as it minimal it should add to prints snug fitting. (Yes it works better without a perfect bridge)\r\n\r\nSome of the pics are of the non parametric version; it has a smaller wedge in the hook but otherwise is near identical to the openSCADâ€™s uploaded stl\r\n\r\nBTW: http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2012/01/30/openscad-what-would-you-like-to-learn-next/\r\n\r\nupdate(9th Jan 2013)made changes to work with Customizer"
