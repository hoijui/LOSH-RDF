    okh:function """This is a box that is designed to be laser cut.  It can be used for the storage and counting of screws and nuts and has a notch for stacking alignment.  A divider is installed while the box is being used for storage to prevent any nuts or screws from falling out of the sorting holes.\r
\r
I designed this for sorting 4-40 nuts and 1/2" long 4-40 screws.  I used 1/8" hardboard for the material.  You ideally want the material that the box is made from the be the same thickness as the parts that you are sorting. The 1/8" hardboard is a little thicker than the nuts, so you sometimes get 2 in one sorting hole.  Running your hand over the sorting area you can easily feel when there are 2 in a hole and correct the situation.  When I sell a 6 Packer (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16290, for sale at timogiles.etsy.com) I need to count out 22 screws and 22 nuts to be packaged.  This box makes counting much faster and does a great job storing them when I'm done!""" ;
