function: I made this guide to keep the filament lined up with the hobbed markings on the extruder bolt. I find the arc of the filament from unspooling would tend to push itself off the markings and then my print would suffer. I tried other guides, but most of them were a plate with a hole which did work but put too much resistence on the filament causing the same issue. This one is very small, slides on the bolts of the extruder's resistence arm, and floats so it can move a little if needed. This worked great with the least amount of resistence. It only takes a few minutes to print it and try one.
