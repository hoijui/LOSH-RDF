function: "Nearing completion of a project, I found that I needed one more Misumi HBLFSN5 cast corner bracket than I had.  Designed and printed this instead of ordering one.\r\n\r\nIt will work with Misumi 2020 style aluminum extrusion.\r\n\r\nNote: This was a quick hack to get me back on to building my other project.  It's not been parameterized, or cleaned up at all.  It has, however, been printed and tested to work."
