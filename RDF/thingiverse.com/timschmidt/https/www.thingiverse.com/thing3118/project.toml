function = "I've collected a full set of mendel parts, and replaced as many STLs as possible with existing OpenSCAD versions - including the latest versions of Vik's files and the OpenSCAD rework of Wade's geared extruder.  I'm working to replace the remaining STLs with OpenSCAD re-works.  Also on the todo list is unifying various configuration options into a single config file, and extracting more shared code into mendel_misc.inc.\r\n\r\nI will gladly accept patches, pull requests, additional files, etc.  Let's hack on the mendel like a proper software project!"
