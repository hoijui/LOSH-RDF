function: "This is an experimental Z axis combined leadscrew base for the Mendel.  It's been modified to reduce the number of printed and non-printed parts necessary, and also to parameterize the length of the available Z motor adjustment slots.\r\n\r\nI've integrated a Z bar clamp into the body of the leadscrew base, which utilizes the frame bar and nuts holding the leadscrew base in place to clamp the Z bar in place as well.  This design was inspired by Whosawhatsis' parameterized Huxley work.\r\n\r\nI've included two STLs, one which closely mimics the original Z axis combined leadscrew base in dimensions, and one which (on my mendel) is sized large enough such that it butts up against the closest frame vertex, eliminating two more nuts from the BOM.\r\n\r\nAlthough I've paid close attention to positioning everything, this part should be considered experimental, I haven't installed it on a real machine yet, nor have I parameterized it much.  You've been warned."
