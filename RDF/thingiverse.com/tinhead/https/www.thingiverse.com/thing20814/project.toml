function = "This is the smallest printable tracked base I was able to print reliably.\r\n\r\nIt is designed as two independent mirrored halves, each one hosting it's reduction gearing, motor, etc.\r\n\r\nThe only vitamins you need are motors and 4mm threaded rods, the rest is all printed or filament.\r\n\r\nThe motors are the round type found in most CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drives to close/open the tray, so get your old drives and find a matching pair :) Important: keep the small screws keeping the motor in place you will need them.\r\n\r\nIt's all designed in Blender so you get the .blend file for now, I'll add stl's at a later point."
