function: "I created a 3D text of the MakerBot name/logo that you can print out to add bling to your printer or maybe blend into other objects like key chains or what have you.  I created this in Solidworks (because that is what I know) so I attached the native part file in addition to the STL file.\r\n\r\nMy daughter and I finished building our Makerbot Thing-O-Matic last week and we decided to paint it red on the outside and white on the inside.  This obliterated the nice logo's that Makerbot prints on the wood, so that is what we decided to create this 3D printed logo to attach onto the front of the bot."
