function = "One of the first things I designed and printed for my Thing-O-Matic was a cover for the Arduino/motherboard opening in the side of the bot.  The cover has holes in the right places for the USB cable, SD card and reset button.  the cover replaces two of the 3/4\" spacers under the motherboard and that is how it is held in place.  \r\n\r\nI think it cleans up the look of the printer and maybe protects the motherboard from being poked at by curious little fingers."
