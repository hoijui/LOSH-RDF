function = "While I was waiting the 4 weeks for my Thing-O-Matic to arrive, I was thinking of all sorts of improvements for it before I even built it.  One thing I knew I wanted to do was to integrate the Gen4 Interface directly into the machine.  So I designed a new mounting for it so it is on a hinged panel that swings out the front when needed....and closes back up into the bot when not used.  There is plenty of space in the electronics area for the interface parts to fit, even with the 2 stepper drivers mounted right behind it.\r\n\r\nI used the original Gen4 Interface PCBA and LCD panel, and just remounted them on parts I printed with the Thing-O-Matic.  I designed the hinge to have detents so it holds the panel in place when pushed all the way in or pulled out.  I am using blue tape a pull handle until I decide what kind of permanent handle to print and mount.\r\n\r\nI think it just gives the bot a more finished look, but does not change any actual functionality."
