function = "Someone requested a 3D printed copy of this stylized duck based on some plans from a wood turning project.  It was easy enough to make a 3D model.  I first tried printing the duck as one piece vertically, but the overhangs were a problem.  So I split the duck body down the center and printed 2 mirrored halves.  This turned out much better."
