function = "While staying at someone's house for a while, my wife found the shower difficult to use.  The Grohe shower head is one of those hand held types, but the wall bracket did not match the shower head correctly, and held it at the wrong angle....the shower head was perpetually pointing in towards the wall.  So to shower, you had to constantly hold the shower head in your hand the whole time.  My first thought was that that bracket was mounted upside down or something, but no luck.  It must just be mismatched.  So, I designed and printed a new bracket that holds the shower head at the right angle.\r\n\r\nAfter I was done, I noticed other similar OpenSCAD objects on Thingiverse, that I probably could have modified, but I made a new one in Solidworks since I did not search until afterwards."
