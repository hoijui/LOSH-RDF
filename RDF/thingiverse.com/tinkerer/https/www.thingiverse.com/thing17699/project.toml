function = "I needed a rubber door stopper to keep my kitchen door from denting the side of my stainless-steel/gray refrigerator.  I couldn't really find anything other than some ugly white stick-on ones at the hardware store.  I wanted something gray that would blend in.....so I made one.  I used my Thing-o-matic to 3D print a negative mold of the final shape, then I formed the doorstop itself using sillicone rubber (or homemade Sugru.   See my instructions below.  \n\nI do not expect anyone to actually make an copy of this, but maybe serve as inspiration of other things you can make using your 3D plastic printer that are not plastic.  I find my printer so handy to make things for around the house."
