    okh:function """I needed a rubber door stopper to keep my kitchen door from denting the side of my stainless-steel/gray refrigerator.  I couldn't really find anything other than some ugly white stick-on ones at the hardware store.  I wanted something gray that would blend in.....so I made one.  I used my Thing-o-matic to 3D print a negative mold of the final shape, then I formed the doorstop itself using sillicone rubber (or homemade Sugru.   See my instructions below.  

I do not expect anyone to actually make an copy of this, but maybe serve as inspiration of other things you can make using your 3D plastic printer that are not plastic.  I find my printer so handy to make things for around the house.""" ;
