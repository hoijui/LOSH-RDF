\r
You can buy one in the MakerBot Store! http://store.makerbot.com/3g-5d-shield-for-cupcake.html\r
\r
This is a shield for the Gen3 Motherboard that allows connecting a fourth stepper (for controlling a stepper-extruder) directly to the motherboard. This is my "sorry guys" for coming up with the firmware changes and that ugly cable hack that was used to connect the Gen3 EC to an external stepper.\r
\r
Note: I fixed a glitch in the RPM variants of the Machines.xml files. Sorry about that.\r
\r
Below you can download a file "3G_5D_Profiles.zip" that contains three profiles: \r
\r
A skeinforge 40 profile, called "3G 5D (Dimension) Example v2," that is the same profile I use with both Gen3+Shield and Gen4 motherboards. Note that this profile is NOT for use the RPM variants of the machines files. \r
\r
Two skeinforge 35 profiles, called "3G 5D Shield (RPM) 1.75mm ABS MK7" and "3G 5D Shield (RPM) 1.75mm PLA MK7," that can be really be used with any stepper-driven extruder. These are for use with the RPM variants of the machine files.\r
\r
Update Oct 2nd, 2011: I just updated the hex file with endstop fixes. I also uploaded a new firmware based on 3.0 that will work better with RepG26. You will need to update the EC to 3.0 as well. The stock EC firmware will work. The source for the new 3.0 fimware is here: https://github.com/giseburt/G3Firmware/tree/3G-5D-Shield-3.0\r
\r
Update Nov 4th, 2011: I've added an E-Stop connector and associated circuitry to make it reset the bot in case of a failure. Because of this I've changed the pricing slightly.\r
\r
 Update Nov 13th, 2011: I've fixed a glitch in the 5D machines file for use with RepG27.""" ;
