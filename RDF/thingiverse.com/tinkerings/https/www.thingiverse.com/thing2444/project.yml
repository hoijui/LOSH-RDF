function: "When building my Cupcake, I found that there are two sets of screws that are very difficult to put in place: the Z-rod bearing brackets, and the X-rod rod covers.\r\n\r\nThis tool is designed to be a 4-nut \"wrench\" to hold four nuts in place around the rod so you can start and tighten those sets of screws with relative ease. The tool has two ends, one for the Z-rods, the other for the X-rods.\r\n\r\nI have printed and tested this. I'm very happy with it. I've also determined that it's very useful for maintenance.\r\n\r\nSince there is a huge chicken-and-egg problem with this tool, if there is interest I will put this up on Shapeways for sale at a reasonable price. I also designed it so it can be made with a laser cutter from two pieces of material.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Built-to-Spec is now selling it on their store: http://builttospecstore.storenvy.com/products/53608-cupcake-tool-v1-3\r\n\r\nIt is also very helpful for putting together a Thing-O-Matic!\r\n\r\nI designed it in Illustrator, exported it to DXF, imported thos into SketchUp, exported those to STL using this plugin.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.3\r\n\xE2\u20AC\xA2 It now works better for the Z-stage, and it fits the nuts better.\r\n\xE2\u20AC\xA2 I added grooves from the edge to make the nut-holding potion part of the outer skin, reducing oozing and making the build quality better.\r\n\r\nTo-Do:\r\n\xE2\u20AC\xA2 Add a bevel to the back so it is easier to remove once the screws are tightened.\r\n\xE2\u20AC\xA2 More photos of how to use it."
