function: "This is a derivative of the MakerBot Temperature Sensor board.\r\n\r\nI rerouted it so that all of the primary wiring is on the back side to make home-etching and soldering easier. Since a home-etched board doesn\\'t have plated thru-holes, wires that connect via a thru-hole would have to be soldered on both sides, which is more difficult that it sounds.\r\n\r\nThere is one via, and I changed the LED and current-limiting resistor to SMT.\r\n\r\nI added a capacitor for power conditioning.\r\n\r\nThe outline it modified to support mounting along the end of the EC, sharing the two top screws.\r\n\r\nNote that in the photos, I hadn't added the outline or the capacitor yet."
