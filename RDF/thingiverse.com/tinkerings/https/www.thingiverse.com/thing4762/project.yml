function: "Because I believe every 'bot should have at least one of these, I made a video. Behold: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iGnlqBLn5s&sns=em\r\n\r\nI started with the latest Mechanical Endstop on thingiverse from MakerBot (v1.0), which is for the Gen4 electronics, cleaned up the traces to make it easier to make at home, and then made a few. \r\n\r\nI quickly realized that I would need support parts to make these work in my Cupcake, and so far I have the Z Minimum (down) working and a good start on the X and Y supports as well. \r\n\r\nI have provided the PDF I used for toner transfer, the sourcefikes for the board and the schematic in Eagle, and the OpenSCAD and STL files for the two parts needed for the Z-Minimum endstop. \r\n\r\nTodo:\r\nMove the traces further from the screws so a home-etched board doesn't need tape to not short on the screws/nuts. \r\nAdd a LED position on the back of the PCB in case the shelf is printed in non-clear plastic.\r\nX and Y stages.\r\n\r\nThese boards should also work well with the Mendel inspired x and y carriage lowrider by twotimes http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4213 With that the X and Y endstops are already done, and you only need the Z!"
