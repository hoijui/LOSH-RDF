function: "This thing lets you use thinner z rod with your current m8 carriage ends. \r\n\r\nThis is a test part that I printed but didn't end up testing. The theory is that a thinner z rod would be less likely to cause wobbles in the print if it was non-straight. This piece is the id of a 10-20 coupling nut (yes, I'm american... I know... It's what they have in stores here, so It's what I designed for...) and the od of an 8mm nut. You should be able to \r\n1- print this, \r\n2- press in a 10-20 coupling nut whilst still hot\r\n3- swap out your flexible coupling for something that will grab the smaller 10-24 rod\r\n4- use the same x-carriage and print with fewer wobbles!"
