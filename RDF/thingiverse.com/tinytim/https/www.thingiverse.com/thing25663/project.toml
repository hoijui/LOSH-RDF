function = "Decided to derive a feeder upgrade for my ultimaker over the weekend using only stuff I already had lying around.\r\n\r\nThis is a basic derivative of the stock ultimaker feeder, but allowing a rollerblade bearing to be used to press the fibre against the hobbed bolt using a spring-loaded end block.\r\n\r\nThe vertices in the model were placed by hand (approximately) but the whole thing prints fine and seems to work all right (so far)."
