\r
This is a basic derivative of the stock ultimaker feeder, but allowing a rollerblade bearing to be used to press the fibre against the hobbed bolt using a spring-loaded end block.\r
\r
The vertices in the model were placed by hand (approximately) but the whole thing prints fine and seems to work all right (so far).""" ;
