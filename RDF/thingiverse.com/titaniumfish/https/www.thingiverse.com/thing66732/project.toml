function = "This is a custom lid for a coke bottle (tested with a 2 litre bottle). It has 2 siphon tubes at the top for your use. \r\n\r\nI designed this thing as part of a drinks dispenser. One side of the siphon tube attaches to an air line. The other side has a tube that goes to the bottom of the bottle. Air goes in, liquid comes out (hopefully)"
