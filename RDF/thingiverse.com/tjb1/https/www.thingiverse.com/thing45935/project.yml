function: "Small vise that is printable, jaws are 2\" wide and can open up to 1.5\".  Use M4x60mm Pan Head Phillips from Lowe's and 2xM4 nuts, one in the back of the jaw to lock the machine screw and one in the spur wheel.  \n\nThis is a project for a class in school that I have made, I have not printed it yet but will be doing so soon.  Gap between jaws has a .5\" radius so you hopefully don't have to bridge it.  \n\nNote: This was drawn in inches.  \n\nEdit:  Wheel was updated to have the extrusion on only one side, please place the extrusion at the back so when tightening the jaw, the forced is placed on this small extrusion so it should be easier to turn.  I realized that without a professional machine it would be near impossible to print a .010\" thick extrusion on the bottom side.  \n\nEdit 2: Printed it today and everything worked perfectly with the new wheel file.  \n\nEdit 3 (11/25/2013): Rotated base and block, all parts should now be printable in current configuration."
