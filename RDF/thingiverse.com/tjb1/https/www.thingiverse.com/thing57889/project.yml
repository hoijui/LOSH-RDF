function: "Edit:  I see this is still being added to favorites quite often, but I would like to add that this is not for the new Kossel (Mini).  This only works with the Legacy Kossel.  \n\nThis works with the Kossel effector. Fits a Makergear groovemount, dimension of hole on bottom is .625\" and .190\" deep so if your hotend matches that it will work.  Hole through center is 2mm, works with the M5 quick connects from Tri D printing but should fit all other M5 quick connects.  \n\nFits the effectors with the 6x60* hole spacing only and only works with 1.75mm filament.  \n\nHole spacing is 120* x 3 holes on a 50mm circle."
