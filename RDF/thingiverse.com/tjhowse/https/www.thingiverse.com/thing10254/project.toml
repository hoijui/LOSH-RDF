function = "This is a spindle variant on randyy's excellent parametric filament spool, with two notches 60mm apart along a supporting arm. It is designed to clip onto the two two parallel threaded rods on a mendel or prusa, and possibly other types of reprap, and hold the spool up away from the printer.\r\n\r\nIt's got a few dags on it, and could probably have some cutouts taken to reduce cost of print, but I wanted it sturdy.\r\n\r\nDerivative of: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8317"
