function = "This is a dock for a Motorola Defy mobile phone. It's designed such that the USB plug will fit into the side, and the soft buttons along the bottom are accessible. There is a space in the rear support of the dock to hold a weight if you want to make it a bit more stable, and a small cutout into which you can hook the charging cable."
