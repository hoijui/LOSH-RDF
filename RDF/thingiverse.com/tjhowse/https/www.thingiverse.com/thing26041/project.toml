function = "This is a quadcopter design that uses the folded aluminium bars from a fly screen as the arm struts.\r\n\r\nNote that the motor mounts are designed for a spacing of 42mm diagonally between the motor mounting bolts. This is parametrically adjustable.\r\n\r\nA bill of materials for my build is available here: \r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq6iGQSKjhLXdEZ6RmtVU3BITUVkczgyS0N6aTFQbWc\r\n\r\nTotal weight is 906 grams, with a 2200mAH li-po battery. I have 400 grams of steel strapped to the bottom as a dead weight. It can fly for about five minutes with that load.\r\n\r\nExplaination video:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QZtf85m5vY\r\nAction video:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrC8AcyuGwY\r\n\r\nFor more up-to-date, but less-documented parts, I'm hosting the scad files here: https://github.com/tjhowse/quad"
