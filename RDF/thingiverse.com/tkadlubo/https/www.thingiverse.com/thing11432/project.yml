function: "This is a cover for a pocket notebook that is compatible with Levenger Circa system.\r\n\r\nLevenger and Circa are trademarks of the Levenger Company (http://levenger.com).\r\n\r\nOn the photo (left to right): a new cover with protective coating, a cover with blue leather glued around it, a cover with protective coating taken off, a full notebook made from 2 of those covers, some linen, and leather. This notebook has seen over a year of hard use in the front pocket of my jeans, which gave it a nice weathered feel."
