function = "This is a small hand rake for gardening. I like the idea of making useful things on 3D printers, and if you like gardening you'll probably find this useful. My first print wasn't great but it proved the idea. I think with more infill it would work great. Try something strong like 70% infill and a few shells it should work great. The part is large (8 inches long) as it was designed for the Ultimaker, but I believe Repraps could do it too? Makerbotters would need to cut and glue for it to work.\r\n\r\nThis is my first Thing on Thingiverse, which I'm excited about, so even though I want to make some improvements I thought I'd share it. The improvements I'd make are that I'd adjust the spacing of the finger indentations slightly, and increase the length of the tongs a bit. Look for a derivative if I get around to it. Source is Solidworks 2012 and I'll update this with that soon.\r\n\r\nI'll also probably make a nice little shovel to go with it soon."
