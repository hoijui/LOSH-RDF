    okh:function """This is a small hand rake for gardening. I like the idea of making useful things on 3D printers, and if you like gardening you'll probably find this useful. My first print wasn't great but it proved the idea. I think with more infill it would work great. Try something strong like 70% infill and a few shells it should work great. The part is large (8 inches long) as it was designed for the Ultimaker, but I believe Repraps could do it too? Makerbotters would need to cut and glue for it to work.\r
\r
This is my first Thing on Thingiverse, which I'm excited about, so even though I want to make some improvements I thought I'd share it. The improvements I'd make are that I'd adjust the spacing of the finger indentations slightly, and increase the length of the tongs a bit. Look for a derivative if I get around to it. Source is Solidworks 2012 and I'll update this with that soon.\r
\r
I'll also probably make a nice little shovel to go with it soon.""" ;
