    okh:function """The $8 Ikea "Not" lamp is a great cheap floor lamp, and I've got several at home. I realized though that a few of the lamps I have would be nicer if they didn't need to rest on the floor, so I designed and printed this simple bracket that allows you to mount one on your wall. Its 6 5/8" long so its no good for a MakerBot, but it fits great on my Ultimaker and I think RepRaps could do it too.\r
\r
Mine was printed with .35mm layer height (the "Low" quality profile in NetFabb) and 4.9mm infill spacing. Its a bit springy but I wanted a quick print to make sure it would even work. I'd recommend tighter infill like 2-3mm spacing for less springy-ness, which will be apparent when you switch it on, if you don't use a switched outlet.\r
\r
Ikea lamp is here:\r

\r
But they have plenty of cheap wall sconces, so this is more for those who want to convert an existing lamp. I do want to say though that I'm pretty happy for coming up with a real useful 3D print here.""" ;
