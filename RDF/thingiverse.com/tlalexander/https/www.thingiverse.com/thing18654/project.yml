function: "Picture this: You're just getting ready to film your breakthrough documentary on Cholula Hot Sauce, but during your \"research\" you accidentally bathe your prized video camera in that very condiment. Your dreams, and your camera's electrical innards, seem short-circuited.\r\n\r\nBut wait! Your Galaxy Nexus has a fine camera on it. Why not use that? Alas, there's no easy way to mount it to your tripod! You might find a mount on here, but then you have to go find a nut to thread it into your tripod, and thats annoying.\r\n\r\nWell, if you happen to have the same el-cheapo tripod that I got somewhere like 10 years ago, then you're in luck!\r\n\r\nThis Thing is a basic tripod mount for the Galaxy Nexus. Its tapered just like the nexus, so slap it in your tripod, place the thin end of the nexus in the slot, and then just slide the phone towards the fat end until you're happy with how snug it is. It can fit pretty tight if you want it to! It certainly won't fall out. Its made to fit the tripod quick release I have, but I think most cheapie tripods still use the same setup.\r\n\r\nDon't have the same tripod? I Uploaded a special version just for you! Its got a hole for a hex nut in it so that you can put a 1/4-20 nut in it and it should work with any standard tripod! I haven't tested that yet, but will update when I can. (UPDATE: Works great!)\r\n\r\nNotably, this was designed for the US Verizon LTE version, which is thicker than the International GSM version. If someone tells me how thick the thing is in the middle and 20mm each direction from there, I can easily whip up a version for the GSM variety.\r\n\r\nSolidworks 2012 source files as well as IGES included, for maximum not having to edit STLs."
