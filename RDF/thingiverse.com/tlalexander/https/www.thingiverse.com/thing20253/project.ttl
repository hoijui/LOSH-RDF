\r
I've downloaded the MakerBot Replicator and converted it to formats that are more portable between CAD systems. I think STEP would have been sufficient, but why not throw a few more out there too! If you're not sure, try STEP. But someone specifically asked for Parasolid, and I figured I'd throw in IGES too.\r
\r
I also exported a simple Bill of Materials that looks like it will be a good start for people. Hint! if you see a part number like 91290A110 or similar, its a McMaster Carr part number. But you already knew that didn't you?\r
\r
Of note - I looked at the export settings in hopes I've done it right, but I never use STEP or Parasolid so I'm not sure. Let me know if I messed it up!\r
\r
Also of note, this includes the entire assembly for the dual MK7 extruders, so if you need those parts, they're in here!\r
\r
One component is missing though. The file MP138-Type-K_Thermocouple_2.sldprt. You'd have to ask a man named Jack at MBI about that.\r
\r
EDIT: Jack has been found! Missing part is here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20348""" ;
