function: "This is a fun part, inspired by an example image on the K3dsurf page:\r\nhttp://k3dsurf.sourceforge.net/images/k3d1171.png from\r\nhttp://k3dsurf.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nHowever, I designed mine in solidworks since I don't like mesh stuff.\r\n\r\nIts pretty basic but its great for testing retract/stringing and jump/lift, and also for illustrating why a minumum layer time setting is critical for a slicer (something NetFabb currently lacks, though I hear the newest beta has it half implemented)."
