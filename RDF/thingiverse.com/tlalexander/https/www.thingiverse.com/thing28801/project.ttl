    okh:function """This part will solve bowden tube popping issues. If you've got access to a manual (or CNC) lathe or a CNC mill, you can make it. I show it with a hex, but that is optional and I only did it as I had a CNC mill handy and in that case it didn't matter if it was round or hex. Round works just as well though! It was designed with help from Joergen Geerds and he and I have tested them over several months with PLA and ABS with great success.\r
\r
Drawings and everything are included in the Zip. the STL is useless but thingiverse makes a nice preview out of it.""" ;
