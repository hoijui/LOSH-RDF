This was taken from the Rostock Github plywood.scad file, converted to STL, then manually converted to a real part/drawing in solidworks (OpenSCAD didn't do anything when I tried to export as DXF).\r

Remember designers - even if you made something by hand, providing CAD files helps builders understand what they are making. :)""" ;
