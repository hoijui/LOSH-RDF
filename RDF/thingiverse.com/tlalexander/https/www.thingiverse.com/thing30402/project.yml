function: "Apparently no one on the internet wanted to actually provide this file in a usable format for someone who might have a laser/router (even printing it onto large format paper would be helpful), so I figured that - again - I should save the internet with my file conversion-fu. This was taken from the Rostock Github plywood.scad file, converted to STL, then manually converted to a real part/drawing in solidworks (OpenSCAD didn't do anything when I tried to export as DXF).\r\n\r\nRemember designers - even if you made something by hand, providing CAD files helps builders understand what they are making. :)"
