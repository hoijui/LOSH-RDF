function = "The Rostock rods were taking 45 minutes apiece on my printer, and I was really wishing I could print more than one at once. Problem is, it just barely fits on the build platform, so you can't just make a plate like normal.\r\n\r\nInstead, I pulled this into solidworks and basically added a raft-like feature on top so I could stack them.\r\n\r\nThey don't come out as pretty this way (though messing with slicing settings could help), but they do look like they'll work just fine.\r\n\r\nI haven't printed them the full 6 up, but I printed up to 3 and its pretty solid, so I think 6 up would work just fine. I added a six up version and a 3 up version. 3 up might be best so you can test the slicing parameters and make sure it works before spending more time."
