    okh:function """The Rostock rods were taking 45 minutes apiece on my printer, and I was really wishing I could print more than one at once. Problem is, it just barely fits on the build platform, so you can't just make a plate like normal.\r
\r
Instead, I pulled this into solidworks and basically added a raft-like feature on top so I could stack them.\r
\r
They don't come out as pretty this way (though messing with slicing settings could help), but they do look like they'll work just fine.\r
\r
I haven't printed them the full 6 up, but I printed up to 3 and its pretty solid, so I think 6 up would work just fine. I added a six up version and a 3 up version. 3 up might be best so you can test the slicing parameters and make sure it works before spending more time.""" ;
