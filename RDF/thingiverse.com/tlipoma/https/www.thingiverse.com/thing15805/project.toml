function = "Update: Added NexusDock3! This version incorporates some of the great improvements from JinxTheRabbit. The device now fits much better into the dock and doesn't wobble around. The dock also has a cable guide on the bottom to keep it flat.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Added Dock2 which has a larger USB hole to accommodate other USB cables.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Moved USB hole to fit the phone better. Changed back to be more stable and hide USB.\r\n\r\nThis is a dock for my new Galaxy Nexus. It uses the cable from my old original droid. If you use a different cable you may need to adjust the hole size a bit."
