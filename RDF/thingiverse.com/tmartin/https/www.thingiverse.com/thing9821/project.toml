function = "Just in time for the Fourth of July! This is intended to be a semi-disposable dirt-cheap model rocket that can be produced in under an hour on a makerbot in only one print. It uses standard inexpensive estes C-class motors since these are not much more expensive than an A motor and much more powerful. It has been flown three times and has performed well each time. It does not have a parachute or any other recovery mechanism and on the occasions I've flown it I have yet to retrieve one since it travels extremely high and seems to disintegrate when the ejection charge goes off. I flew it mainly at night for the spark trail effects and couldn't find it afterwords, but judging by the impressive visible trail it flew very far and straight. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This rocket has no method of retarding it's descent and presents a potential hazard to anyone in the area, fly only in uninhabited areas and at your own risk.\r\n\r\nDesign Features: The six fins towards the back give this rocket good stability despite its short height by packing a large surface area behind the center of gravity (provided by the weight of the motor). In order to keep the height within the limits of a standard makerbot I felt the extra fins were a good idea, and besides they look cool. The ring fin provides some extra surface area but mainly aids in durability to keep the thin fins from snapping off. The motor sits partway up the rocket body to bring the center of gravity as far forward as possible for stability reasons. The printed part tapers away from the rocket motor and seems to have enough clearance from the hot gasses, but nevertheless may present some fire hazard although this hasn't been observed in any tests yet."
