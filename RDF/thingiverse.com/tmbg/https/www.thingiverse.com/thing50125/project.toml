function = "I printed TheCase's excellent mini-quadruped design, and I love the simplicity of the parts, but I wanted a third degree of freedom in the leg for more complete kinematics, so I slightly redesigned the leg parts.\r\n\r\nThis also results in a slightly less bulky leg.\r\n\r\nFor now, I've left off the servo buttons at the coxa joint, but I may go back and add them back in for smoother motion. \r\n\r\nIf there's interest, I may workup a PCB which carries a Teensy 2.0 microcontroller board and provides power and support for twelve servos.\r\n\r\nUpdate:  Video of its first gait!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsHNA3oLXC8"
