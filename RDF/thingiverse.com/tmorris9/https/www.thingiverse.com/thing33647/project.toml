function = "Tiny photo stand inspired by the \"frameless photo stand\" here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24630\r\n\r\nI wanted to make it hold the photo a bit tighter as well as the weighted quarter. This one is taller as well and you can actually lift the entire unit by the photo and it won't slip off.\r\n\r\nI am printing a bunch of these and giving them to photographer friends, they love them."
