These are used for model making, headlight restoration, guitar restoration, Polymer clay and much more.  \nI have been using them to sand my printed Star Trek badges.   \nI decided I needed a storage container to keep them organized so I built this one.  \nIf you want some of these unique pads you can get them at http://epoxyjewelry.com/misc.html"
