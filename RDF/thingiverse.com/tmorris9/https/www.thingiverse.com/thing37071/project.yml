function: "Micro Mesh pads are high precision double sided flexible foam sanding pads. These are used for model making, headlight restoration, guitar restoration, Polymer clay and much more.  \nI have been using them to sand my printed Star Trek badges.   \nI decided I needed a storage container to keep them organized so I built this one.  \nIf you want some of these unique pads you can get them at http://epoxyjewelry.com/misc.html"
