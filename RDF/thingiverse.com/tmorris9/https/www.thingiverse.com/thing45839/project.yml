function: "I am a fan of these small puck shaped cheese disks so I decided to print a stacking holder for them.\r\n\r\nThese cheeses come in a pack of 6 so I made this tall enough for that.\r\n\r\nMy printer was not tall enough to print it in one shot so I divided it into 2 pieces that can easily be glued together.\r\n\r\nI originally designed it to hold them with the cellophane in place but after I made it I found my next batch of cheese would not fit as well, there were variations on the cellophane wrapper.\r\n\r\nSo instead just remove the cellophane and put the bits in with just their wax shell on."
