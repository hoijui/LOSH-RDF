Rather than just making it flat faced I made it with the center inset to it's framed.\r\n\r\nAfter printing I decided to fill the middle with doming epoxy (that's what I sell for a living) and I think it looked pretty good. It will look good without the epoxy as well.\r\n\r\nCould also be used as a keychain."
