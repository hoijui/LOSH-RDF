function: "When heating up soup or canned meals in the microwave I always covered them with a paper towel to prevent splatter (covering the inside of the microwave with bits of food).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that many times the paper towel dips down into the food soaking it up and making a mess.\r\n\r\nSo I designed this to solve the issue. It covers the paper bowls while still allowing hot steam to escape. If the food splatters, just rinse it off in water."
