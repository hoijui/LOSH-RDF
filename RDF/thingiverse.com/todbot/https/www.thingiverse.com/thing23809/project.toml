function = "Enclosure for MAKE's / Adafruit's Menta Arduino board.\r\n\r\n(see: http://www.makershed.com/Mintronics_MENTA_p/mkad43.htm & http://ladyada.net/make/menta/ )\r\n\r\nIt's a great little Arduino clone that fits in a mint tin yet still has Arduino-standard header sockets for shields.\r\n\r\nI found the mint tin limiting though if you're adding wires & parts to your circuit, plus I have always felt a little iffy about putting prototypes in metal enclosures.\r\n\r\nSo here's a printable case for mint tin-sized circuits like the Menta.  It has openings for the DC power jack and the FTDI cable.\r\n\r\nIncluded is a 25mm high version and a 35mm high version.  For larger or smaller sizes, it's pretty easy to stretch the case bottom to fit your size.  Also you can design in some holes for pots & switches on the top.\r\n\r\nThe case top has little clasps that grab onto the small nubs on the case bottom to securely keep the case on."
