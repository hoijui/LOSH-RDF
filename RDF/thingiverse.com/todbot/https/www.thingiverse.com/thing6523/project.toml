function = "Here is a simple enclosure for a LinkM USB-to-I2C adapter for programming BlinkMs. ( http://linkm.thingm.com/ )  Normally LinkM comes with an enclosure, but if you want to make a custom one for yourself, you can use this as a template.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure is made so it will snap together and not need glue. (Though adding a dab of glue once assembled will make a strong fit)\r\n\r\nThe basic form of this enclosure will likely work for other USB \"fob\" sized devices.  Make custom enclosures for your USB thumb drives!"
