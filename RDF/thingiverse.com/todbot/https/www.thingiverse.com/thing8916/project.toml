function = "For Maker Faire this year I made a second version of my BlinkM Cylon: BlinkM Cylon mkII. This is not a very cost-effective way of getting a Cylon effect. It however is a good way of showing how to wire up multiple BlinkMs with a long cable, using the new WireM cabling kit for BlinkM. And unlike normal Cylon circuits, this has full RGB color effects and gradual fading.\r\n\r\nIt features a snap-fit laser-cut enclosure.\r\n\r\nFor details on the circuit see:\r\nhttp://todbot.com/blog/2011/05/29/blinkm-cylon-mkii/"
