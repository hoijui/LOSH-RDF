function = "Do you like to play dominoes but do not have a set of tiles or bones to play with? Then you need this file. Make your own dominoes out of acrylic or wood with this file. \r\n\r\nI plan to make lots of these for friends and family in different colors out of different materials. I will use 3/8 inch or 1 cm think material to cut out the tiles. I then will paint the dots with a contrasting color.\r\n\r\nMy first project was made with a 12 inch by 12 inch (30.4 cm by 30.4 cm) piece of 1 cm think hobby plywood obtained from a big box store of national recognition. The dots were burned into the wood through the rastering or engraving step so no painting was required.\r\n\r\nI set the file up so that you could etch, burn, or engrave a logo on the backside and then flip the panel over before making the dominoes. It should register perfectly, but this has not bee attempted yet.\r\n\r\nGood luck with your project and let me know how it goes.\r\n\r\nTodd"
