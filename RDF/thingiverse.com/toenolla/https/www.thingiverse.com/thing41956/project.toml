function = "A sturdy gauge that shows you the right width to friction fit perpendicular slots on your projects.\r\n\r\nSlots range from hairline to 7mm, in .25mm increments.  It covers most thicknesses that can be cut with hobby lasers.\r\n\r\nThere is space in the center to log the settings and peak output used when you cut the gauge, so you can perfectly recreate the cut that made the gauge slot when you do your project."
