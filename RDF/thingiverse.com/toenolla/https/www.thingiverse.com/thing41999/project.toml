function = "Friction fitting is a difficult process, especially when working across materials that may react differently to the laser.  \r\nMake these gauges out of your favorite materials to determine how to adjust your parallel cuts to create a tight fit.\r\n\r\nCut in increments of 0.1mm.  Includes a hook hole and space to log your cut info, so you can recreate exactly the cut you made when fabricating the gauge.\r\n\r\nUse with my Friction Fit Gauge to get tight finger joins, even between different materials."
