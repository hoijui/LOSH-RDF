function: "Everyone in the world would like to give a Kanye West style to their cellphone. Now with the iKawest, it's possible!\r\n\r\nAlso, it's a pretty original screen protector! Less than the half of the screen can got some dust on it. More! You can't access the touch screen with your fingers. You don't have the choice to use a voice recognition system. It's a revolution!\r\n\r\nIf you print this beautiful accessory with glow in the dark plastic, you will never lost your iphone again!"
