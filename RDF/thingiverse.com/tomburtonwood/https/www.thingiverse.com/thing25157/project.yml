function: "Ok, so if u need an example of how awesome 3d printing is, i saw my nephew today at a family do. he's about 10 or so. he's never used any 3d software before, but he;'s a huge Minecrafter. i introduced him to http://tinkercad.com and after a few of the tutorials came up with this model. i saved the .stl and printed it as soon as i got home. i need to make a few alterations as per his specs but for a first time effort i think this is pretty rad. \r\n\r\ni printed this with raft and support material\r\n\r\nhttps://tinkercad.com/things/jH8wotTFbSK"
