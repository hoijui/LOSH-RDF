function = "This is a total hack building upon jamesvilleneuves Bolt / Nuts v 1.5. \r\n\r\nBasically i want to build sculptures connecting individual modules together using a variety of fasteners and connectors. For the first project i wanted to use threaded screws to connect two objects together. Given all our work with scanned heads and such i thought it would be interesting to have a head screw on and off. \r\n\r\ni have started trying to learn openSCAD so this project by jamesvilleneuve was perfect to build off of. that said my openSCAD skills are not mad skills yet, so i had to resort to a nice little hack instead. \r\n\r\nThus in tinkercad i made a \"positive\" nut to boolean out of the \"top\" of my model. u can DL this here. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33253\r\n\r\nThen i simply booleaned together the actual nut into the space left by the positive. then joined the head and the actual nut together, et voila!\r\n\r\nApps: Netfabb, Tinkercad, openSCAD, RepG Sailfish\r\n\r\nPrinted w.
