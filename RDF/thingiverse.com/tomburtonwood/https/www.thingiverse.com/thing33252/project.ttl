\r
Basically i want to build sculptures connecting individual modules together using a variety of fasteners and connectors. For the first project i wanted to use threaded screws to connect two objects together. Given all our work with scanned heads and such i thought it would be interesting to have a head screw on and off. \r
\r
i have started trying to learn openSCAD so this project by jamesvilleneuve was perfect to build off of. that said my openSCAD skills are not mad skills yet, so i had to resort to a nice little hack instead. \r
\r
Thus in tinkercad i made a "positive" nut to boolean out of the "top" of my model. u can DL this here. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33253\r
\r
Then i simply booleaned together the actual nut into the space left by the positive. then joined the head and the actual nut together, et voila!\r
