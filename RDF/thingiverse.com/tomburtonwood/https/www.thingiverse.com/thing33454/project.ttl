info about BAS: Founded in 2005 by Duncan MacKenzie, Richard Holland, and Amanda Browder, Bad at Sports (B@S) now features over 20 principle collaborators and is a weekly podcast, a series of objects, events, and a daily blog produced in Chicago, San Francisco, Detroit and New York City that features artists and â€œart worldersâ€x9d talking about art and the community that makes, reviews and participates in it.

B@S can be tricky to describe: it acts as a curious investigator, an archivist, oral historian, and occasionally as a provocateur. We produce content that lies somewhere on the venn diagram of art, journalism, media, intellectualism, and â€œthe naughty bits.â€x9d We represent artists and their art world through an archive that is text, audio, physical, ephemeral, historical, and constantly evolving through ongoing and unique projects.
Bad at Sports has â€œdone stuffâ€x9d with apexart in New York City, the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Baer Ridgeway, NADA Art Fair, Open Engagement and many others. We share collaborators with Art Forum, Art Practical, The Chicago Tribune, Chicago Magazine, Art21, BUST magazine, Proximity Magazine, Modern Painters, Beautiful Decay Magazine, Art in America and numerous other publications.

Our podcast has included approximately 400 interviewees/co-conspirators including Kerry James Marshall, Jeff Wall, Larry Rinder, Peter Saul, Liam Gillick, Mary Jane Jacob, Chris Ware, Tania Bruguera, Jeffrey Deitch, James Elkins, Meg Cranston, Carol Becker, and Polly Apfelbaum.
Bad At Sports has been a lot of different people but is currently Brian Andrews, Mark Staff-Brandl, Amanda Browder, Stephanie Burke, Terri Griffith, Richard Holland, Christopher Hudgens, Claudine Ise, Duncan MacKenzie, Patricia Maloney, Sarah Margolis-Pineo, Nicholas Oâ€™Brien, Caroline Picard, Abraham Ritchie, Tom Sanford and Abigail Satinsky.
