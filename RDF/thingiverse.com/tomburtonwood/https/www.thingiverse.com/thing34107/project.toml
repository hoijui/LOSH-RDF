function = "One of the things i love about Thingiverse (haha) is all the connectors, fasteners and hinges that people upload. My art making is loosely focused on modular work and systems. So for me Thingiverse is the perfect research environment. Currently i am building a collection of all the fasteners and connectors that catch my eye, for a new body of work i plan to produce in the New Year.\r\n\r\nRecently I have been making a series of \"Art History\" PEZ toppers. I really like the juxtaposition of iconic sculpture / artworks on the candy dispenser. But i'm also pretty intrigued by the mechanical and formal qualities of this PEZ stem itself.\r\n\r\nTo further extend the modular possibilities for the PEZ dispenser i have hacked together a \"Foot\" connector, not dissimilar to Wallace's slippers in form if not pattern.\r\n\r\nI modeled it in Tinkercad and you can find a lot of my files up there too. This is very much a work in progress. I don't think it's symmetrical for one thing. But it seems to work. I have tested several attachings and detachings.  \r\n\r\nI have uploaded the basic \"slipper\" file. I have also attached this file to tbusers \"Dispenser Insert\" so that you can stack multiple PEZ on top of each other. I plan to make some customs with different heads and embedded connectors. \r\n\r\nI also plan to start making larger sculptures from multiple PEZ stems, connected together with 2 way and 4 way connectors. As these pieces develop i will add them to this page."
