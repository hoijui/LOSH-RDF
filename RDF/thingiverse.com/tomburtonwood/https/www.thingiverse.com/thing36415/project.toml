function = "\"Draped Seated Woman\" by Henry Moore\r\nScanned at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, August 2012\r\n\r\nI guess i got caught up in the whirlwind of the semester starting and forgot to post this earlier in the year. It is a scan made with 123d Catch of Henry Moore's \"Draped Seated Woman.\" This piece has been sited at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in the UK, for about as long as I can remember -- and one assumed it would stay there. However the owners of the piece - Tower Hamlets Council - in London are putting it up for sale at Christies Auction House to meet budget shortfalls. Apparently they hope to raise Â£4 - Â£17 million from the sale of the piece. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/08/henry-moore-sculpture-sold-london_n_2091431.html"
