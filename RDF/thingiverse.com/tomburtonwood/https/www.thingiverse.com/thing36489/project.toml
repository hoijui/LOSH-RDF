function = "Added a pedestal and \"#saveoldflo\" text to my scan of \"Draped Seated Woman - by Henry Moore.\" - the original sculpture of which Tower Hamlets Council in London proposes to sell. I thought it would be fun to add a 3d protest piece to the 2d images and graphics being produced in opposition to the sale of the piece. Can someone in London please print this out for me and deliver it to Tower Hamlets Council. Maybe epoxy it to the pavement (sidewalk) outside their offices.  \r\n\r\nMy printer is en route to Miami right now so i can't print this - but i am adding it to Thingiverse asap and will print a copy of it next week. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.artfund.org/news/2012/11/11/help-save-henry-moores-old-flo\r\n\r\nImage credit: https://twitter.com/BobandRoberta/status/275173312378830848/photo/1"
