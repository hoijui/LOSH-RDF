function: I enjoy watching Netflix on my iPad, especially when my wife is watching "Dancing with the Stars"! I got tired of cupping my hand over the speaker and decided to design one that is form fitting. I know there are several on Thingiverse now, this one was created mid 2011. ***update, I bought my wife a new iPad 4 and it fits perfectly!***
