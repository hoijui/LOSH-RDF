function = "The Makergear M2 electronics enclosure is a beautiful black box that uses no hardware. The lid slips into place but is not locked down. I designed a latch that locks into a slot in the side of the box with a quarter turn, no hardware or drilling holes.\r\n\r\n***update, I've added a bevel to help with clearance issues between the box and Z axis***"
