function = "The fan on my Makergear M2 would tap the frame slightly when homing the X axis. This is easily fixed by rotating the fan slightly, but would mess up my feng shui ;-). I needed to keep the fan square and move it over a few millimeters. This bracket offsets the cooling fan.  \n\n***update, I've moved the hole up 3mm to help the fan clear the clips on the build platform.***"
