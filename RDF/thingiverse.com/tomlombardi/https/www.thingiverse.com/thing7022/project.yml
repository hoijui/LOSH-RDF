function: "Unlike the X axis, the Y axis idler is supported on one end to the acrylic middle plate. This arrangement places a pretty good load on the acrylic and I noticed some flex as the Y axis would change direction. I designed the bracket to fit over the head of the Y axis idler bolt and attach to the two top screws of the rod cover.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this part is dimensioned for a stock ToM. My ToM Y axis rods a slightly longer than the body and make the body bow out. I've seen others comment on this so I know I'm not alone. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not implying that this is a defect in MBIs design, the acrylic may be happy with this for years without problems."
