function = "This takes the slop out of the tension screw on the extruder. Since I've upgraded my MK5 extruder to a MK6 stepstruder I've notice that the filament set screw jumps up and down as the stepstruder does it's reversal routine. Some folks use tape to shim up the slop, I thought it might be more fun to make something to address the problem. I designed this with a hole that is close to the correct size without having to drill it out so much. It's a small part, but it printed out great with the stock MK6 .39mm profile."
