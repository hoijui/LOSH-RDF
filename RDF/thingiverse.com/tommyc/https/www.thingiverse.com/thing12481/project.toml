function = "Slight change to Greg's excellent x-carriage.\r\n\r\n1, I broke at least 2 x-carriages while trying to insert the bearings (I didn't warm up the holders first)  So i change the holder design a bit to let the bearings slide in easily, then i added 2 build-in ziptie channels to the holder themselves.\r\n\r\n2. Added a belt_socket_offset variable to allow changes to belt-socket alignment.  0 gives Greg's default which fits Prusa's new (felt branch) x-ends nicely.  You may want to increase it to something like 10 (guesstimate only) if you are using the original prusa x-ends."
