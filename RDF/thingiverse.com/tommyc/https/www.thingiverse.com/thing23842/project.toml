function = "This version is design for the following Misumi leadscrew and resin nut.\r\n\r\nLeadscrew: MTSTRA10-300-S20-Q6\r\nLeadscrew Nut: MTSRN10\r\n\r\nThe stainless steel leadscrew and resin nut makes for a lub free configuration.  Pairing them with the Misumi LMUW-MX10 self lubricating linear bearing makes for a lubrication free setup.\r\n\r\nYou can also use either a LM10LUU or 2 LM10UU with these x-ends.  I opt for the Misumi LMUW-MX10 because I want to make my printer as maintenance free as possible.\r\n\r\nMore pictures here: http://goo.gl/JRg97"
