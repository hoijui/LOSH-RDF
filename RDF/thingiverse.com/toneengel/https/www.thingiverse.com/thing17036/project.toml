function = "Wooden box designed around a 13.5 inch long, 2 inch diameter spindle assembly from a woodworking support stand.\r\n\r\nWhile there's room for four spools on the spindle, don't count on feeding from more than one since the spindle rotates all the spools.\r\n\r\nMy goal in building this was to stop babysitting the printer. With 1/4\" plastic tube running from the front of the box to the printer, I get nearly constant tension on the Z axis and noticeably more uniform prints than I was getting before.\r\n\r\nNot sure how important managing filament moisture content and dust are yet, this is most likely overkill unless you happen to have the wood and spindle lying around."
