function: This is a relatively simple 24"x24" corrugated cardboard divider assembly. It consists of 22 boards with slots every few inches. This is very similar to what you might get at U-Haul when purchasing one of the wine glass or dish protector boxes, but mine has several improvements. For example, the size is custom, and allows for two layers in a 24x24x8 box with a cardboard pad separating the two layers. Additionally, I used a unique double bladed knife that cuts the grooves perfectly parallel and even across all the boards since I can cut them all at once.
