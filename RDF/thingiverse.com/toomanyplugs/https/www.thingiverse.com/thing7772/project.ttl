\r
It's not really "parametric" like everyone uses the word, but it is editable in OpenSCAD, which was the point (I couldn't figure out a clean scheme for parameters, so I brute-forced it). If someone else wants to clean it up, go for it.\r
\r
I also added Incomplete Polygons for the first 2mm of the holes, as described here: blog.makerbot.com/2010/12/13/design-tip-incomplete-polygons/ I was having trouble getting the little holes to stick on the first layer without this.""" ;
