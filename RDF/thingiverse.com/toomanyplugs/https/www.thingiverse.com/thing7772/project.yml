function: "It is basically the same design, but I needed some extra edge distance on some features so that it would Skein right for my printer. Since I had to recreate it in OpenSCAD anyway, here it is. Buback did all the hard part, I just copied it into a different format.\r\n\r\nIt's not really \"parametric\" like everyone uses the word, but it is editable in OpenSCAD, which was the point (I couldn't figure out a clean scheme for parameters, so I brute-forced it). If someone else wants to clean it up, go for it.\r\n\r\nI also added Incomplete Polygons for the first 2mm of the holes, as described here: blog.makerbot.com/2010/12/13/design-tip-incomplete-polygons/ I was having trouble getting the little holes to stick on the first layer without this."
