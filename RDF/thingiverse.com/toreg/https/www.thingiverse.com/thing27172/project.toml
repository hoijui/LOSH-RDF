function = "A support leg for the box \"retur\" at IKEA for those times you cannot drill in the wall and hang it. (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00165703/)\r\n\r\nElevates it 10cm off the ground and makes it easier to wash the floor etc.\r\n\r\nPs. This is for the back-wall only. I use doublesided tape on my tiled wall to hold it upright.\r\n\r\nPersonally I use these boxes to sort my dirty laundry... So the sorting happens when I undress :-)"
