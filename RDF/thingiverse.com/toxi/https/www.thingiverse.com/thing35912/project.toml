function = "Test object for a new Clojure based generative voxel modelling tool chain with support for automatic hollowing of solids and construction of parametric internal micro-structures using implicit surface functions. The scale of the fillets is freely configurable (in code, not in the uploaded STL of course) and can even be applied recursively as shown in the second thing."
