function = "Late night, trying to load coffee grounds into the filter in order to jump-start my brain with a jetfuel espresso, making a big mess because our Elektra portafilter is too big for the support forks on our Rancilio Rocky grinder.  Isn't it time I learn how to use OpenSCAD anyway? \r\n\r\nThe result: a parametric portafilter support fork.  Now anyone with a Rancilio Rocky coffee grinder can generate a support fork for their portafilter by plugging in their filter's exact outer diameter.  The STL file is designed to print on the MakerBot Replicator 2 with support."
