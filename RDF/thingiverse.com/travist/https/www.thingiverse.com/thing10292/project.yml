function: "A handy way to hang your headphones from your desk.  A couple of guys at work were complaining about the wires from their headphones catching on their chair and knocking things around.  Seemed a pretty simple solution.  I'm probably going to make a v2 that will have lip to hold the cable specifically, but for now this will help.  The \"clamp\" is sized to fit on Ikea desks.  It makes a nice tight grip without any sanding needed from my Cupcake.\r\n\r\nI've included my modules .scad file if you want to change the size of the clamp, or have better ideas for it :)"
