    okh:function """I am working on a project called the Air Quality Egg. Here is a Kickstarter video: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edborden/air-quality-egg\r
\r
We got funding in just 4 days!\r
\r
Okay, so here's the deal, we are a bunch of tinkerers and hackers, who really believe in open source communities. That is why Thingiverse is so awesome to our project. I have been mainly working with the physical prototype of the Air Quality Egg - a form that will hold electronic hardware that communicates with sensors outside your window, door, or wherever you place your sensors.\r
\r
Currently, this prototype is made to be 3D printed. There are special slots for magnets. However, we are investigating with options to create an injection mold. Currently, we have to make over 400 eggs! And the kickstarter isn't even over!\r
\r
I have some experience with casting, and know a lot of the aspects of this model is not good  (undercuts, etc.). I will be tweaking this soon, but would LOVE to see what you guys come up with.\r
\r
Some things that I was thinking:\r
What are some clever connections besides magnets? Maybe threaded? Snaps?\r
\r
Other forms for the Egg? Does it have a flat bottom or something?\r
\r
Let us know your thoughts! There is more information about the process of the project, as well as STL and Rhino files of the digital model throughout different stages. Warning, earlier models are messy! http://airqualityegg.wikispaces.com/Industrial+design\r
\r
Okay, let's get down to it. Rhino files are on the wiki. If you need any other file types that I can export to, let me know: chao.albert@gmail.com\r
\r
Additional technical information:\r
The files are created with Rhino. The digital models are exported from watertight meshes. The two holes in the back is for an Ethernet cord and a power cord. There has been talk about using free software for modeling... I'd be interested!""" ;
