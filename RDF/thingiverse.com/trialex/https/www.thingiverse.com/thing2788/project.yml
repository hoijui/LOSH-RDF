function: "This is a wallet I designed to match my requirements. I currently use a Jimi wallet (http://www.thejimi.com/), which is great, but has no way to store coins. It was also inspired by the \\\"Wood Wallet\\\" by design group on Etsy (http://www.etsy.com/listing/42408406/wood-wallet). I wanted a way to store coins without them rattling around.\r\n\r\nIt is a single solid piece construction. It has five cutouts for Australia\\'s three largest denomination coins - $2, $1 and 50c. The coin holes have access cutouts so you can remove the coins without tipping the whole thing upside down.\r\n\r\nBank notes are folded in thirds and placed on top of the coins, and 4 credit cards are stacked on top and held down with a rubber band. The credit cards keep everything else from falling out.\r\n\r\nThe wallet was design in Pro/Engineer WF2. It is fully parametric - you can change coin diameters etc. to suit the sizes of your currency (.prt file attached). I know Pro/E isn't very common or free/open source; I'm working on v2 in SketchUp."
