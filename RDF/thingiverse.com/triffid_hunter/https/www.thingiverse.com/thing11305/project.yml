function: "I saw prusa's excellent heated bed, but the dimension was too large for the blank stock I had available, and there were too many narrow traces for an easy home etch, so I designed a different one.\r\n\r\nDimensions are 200x200mm, hole centers are 190mm apart.\r\n\r\nDesign resistance is 0.95 ohms. Etch from 1oz (36um) copper to get this resistance.\r\n\r\nGives 150w from a 12v source, and consumes 12.5A.\r\n\r\nI've had my bed up to 140\xC2\xB0C before, and didn't want to take it higher for fear of cracking my glass or damaging the FR4 PCB material."
