\r
Note: pictured model is sized for M6 threaded rods!\r
\r
\r
I've seen a few similar designs but I couldn't find them when I went to look, so I made this one myself from prusa's 'felt' Z motor mount.\r
\r
Unlike prusa's felt mount, this one won't print vertically due to the bar clamp!\r
\r
This eliminates the need for: 4x M3 nylock nuts, 4x M3 washers, 4x M3 screws, 4x M8 washers and 2x M8 nuts; total 20 fewer vitamins.\r
\r
***UPDATED 9 November***\r
Replaced with scad that defaults to standard frame rod spacing, and an STL that has M8 holes rather than M6""" ;
