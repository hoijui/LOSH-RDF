function: "I'm sitting here looking at my printer, thinking \"why are there three separate parts there?\"\r\n\r\nNote: pictured model is sized for M6 threaded rods!\r\n\r\n\r\nI've seen a few similar designs but I couldn't find them when I went to look, so I made this one myself from prusa's 'felt' Z motor mount.\r\n\r\nUnlike prusa's felt mount, this one won't print vertically due to the bar clamp!\r\n\r\nThis eliminates the need for: 4x M3 nylock nuts, 4x M3 washers, 4x M3 screws, 4x M8 washers and 2x M8 nuts; total 20 fewer vitamins.\r\n\r\n***UPDATED 9 November***\r\nReplaced with scad that defaults to standard frame rod spacing, and an STL that has M8 holes rather than M6"
