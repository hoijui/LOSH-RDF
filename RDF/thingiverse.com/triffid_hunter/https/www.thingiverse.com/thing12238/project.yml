function: "Want to upgrade to LM8UUs in the future? Don't have any now? Don't want to print a heap of new parts when you do?\r\n\r\nPrintable LM8UU-sized PLA bushing!\r\n\r\nThese are sized to be a little tight fresh off the bed, but due to their design they wear in quickly - about 15 seconds of pushing up and down a smooth rod for me.\r\n\r\nIf your printer makes them too tight or too loose, just adjust the ID in the scad file.\r\n\r\nScad is fully parametric, should be able to make LM10UU or any other size if you wish."
