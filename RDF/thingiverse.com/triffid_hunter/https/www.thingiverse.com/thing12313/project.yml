function: "Wanted something that would print /fast/ with firmwares that have lookahead acceleration, however this turned out to be a better exercise of bridging algorithms and settings\r\n\r\nI took inspiration from many of the other vertices here on thingiverse but ultimately hacked up the vertex in prusa's repository\r\n\r\n***UPDATED 9 November***\r\nPosted updated scad, and M8 STL\r\n\r\n***UPDATED 14 November***\r\nAdded a block between horizontal and vertical holes, for extra stiffness when installed."
