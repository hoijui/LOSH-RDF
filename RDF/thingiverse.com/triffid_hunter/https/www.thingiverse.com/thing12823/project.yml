function: "I found the clips were very weak due to being printed vertically, so I designed some that are printed horizontally and also have more substantial arms for extra strength.\r\n\r\nI also redesigned the spool to take a clip rather than having one built in\r\n\r\nTODO: feet with sockets, wrist and ankle clips."
