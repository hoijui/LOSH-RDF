\r
I found that the large gear clip sockets were too deep- they came too close to the top of the part and I have quite a number of large gears with the corners snapped off.\r
\r
SO I hacked them up in openscad, making the clips and sockets parametric.\r
\r
I also added an option to round the corners so they can be given to small children.\r
\r
I have rebuilt the center piece in openscad so now it can be made parametric, and have a proper clip socket profile.\r
\r
I have arranged all the pieces into a plate. Approximate plate dimensions are 150x150mm.\r
\r
TODO:\r
* redo the gears themselves in openscad using the excellent gears library in mcad, for a fully parametric cube gears!\r
