function: "*** Last Update October 30 2011 ***\r\n\r\nI found that the large gear clip sockets were too deep- they came too close to the top of the part and I have quite a number of large gears with the corners snapped off.\r\n\r\nSO I hacked them up in openscad, making the clips and sockets parametric.\r\n\r\nI also added an option to round the corners so they can be given to small children.\r\n\r\nI have rebuilt the center piece in openscad so now it can be made parametric, and have a proper clip socket profile.\r\n\r\nI have arranged all the pieces into a plate. Approximate plate dimensions are 150x150mm.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* redo the gears themselves in openscad using the excellent gears library in mcad, for a fully parametric cube gears!\r\n\r\nWIP: not printed yet!"
