    okh:function """This is my 3rd version of printable LM8UU bushings.\r
\r
Prusa suggested to me that putting some spring/give in them could be a good idea, so I gave it a go.\r
\r
They're more than strong enough to handle the forces they get subjected to, and as an added bonus they're far less likely to crack your X-ends when you insert them since they'll happily compress a little.\r
\r
I replaced a set of my original bushings with these, they're still wearing in but seem to work great so far. It certainly solved the chatter problem I had!\r
\r
PLEASE NOTE: ABS is not a suitable material for bushings. It's too soft so it has lots of friction and wears quickly. These printed in ABS would be a novelty only, not a useful part.\r
\r
PLA works well, as will any other hard plastics.""" ;
