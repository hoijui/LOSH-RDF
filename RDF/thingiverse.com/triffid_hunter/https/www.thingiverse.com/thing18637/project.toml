function = "Very similar to prusa's original bar clamps.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\n1) much tighter so they grip more strongly, but not so tight that they're difficult to assemble\r\n2) the \"wings\" are on an angle so the washers will sit flat on them when they're tightened\r\n3) teardrop-shaped horizontal hole for easier printing"
