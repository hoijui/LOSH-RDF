function: "I made this to replace a small plastic part in the distributer of my Pop's MGB. It is the white part pictured next to the damaged original. It functions as a rotating shutter between a photo-gate that sends a signal to ignite the spark plugs. I modeled this part based after the \"Crane xr700 Shutter\" which fits the \"Lucas 24D Distributer\"\r\n\r\nWe've tested this part in the car, and it worked perfectly!"
