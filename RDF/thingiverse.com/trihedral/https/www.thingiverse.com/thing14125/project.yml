function: "My brother's computer seemed to have a bad video card (failed intermittently), but rather than having to poke around replacing capacitors, it turned out it's cooling fan's plastic blades were cracked, keeping it from rotating. So I printed up a new one. \r\nI really didn't expect that my 3d printer would pay for itself, but between repairing computers, cars, and anything else I can imagine, it's getting there."
