    okh:function """The Expandable Spool Holder is free standing, holds as many spools as you would like, and holds most spools of different widths and diameters.  The holder will fit spool diameters with a minimum of 6.125", with no real maximum.  I have used it for the following standard spools: Makerbot RepRap and Printrbot wooden spool. I plan to design other attachements such as: filament guide, feet for flat surfaces, and attachments for hanging the entire assembly.  You can quickly adjust the width with a set screw rather than having to move a nut on all thread.  

*Note: The newest revision has an "indent" so the bearing screw may be tightened down without holding the bearing from spinning (thanks for the recommendaton Lightn).  HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT PRINTED this revison to test it, but the only change is the indent.""" ;
