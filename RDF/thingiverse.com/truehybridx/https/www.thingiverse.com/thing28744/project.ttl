    okh:function """Plastic piece from my 97 F-150 door linkage, its the go-between for the rod that unlatches the door and the handle mechanism.\r
\r
The original piece is a bit more intricate and I'm not sure if i want to replicate the whole thing or just enough to get the door working again :D\r
\r
But ill keep the Sketchup file updated at least.\r
\r
And of course, if you can make it better, by all means make a derivative :D (I'm better in Sketchup than in OpenSCAD so this is what most of my Things will be)\r
\r
Uploaded the OpenSCAD file for it. This one attempts to use a pin of some sort to keep it in the latch hole.""" ;
