function: "Plastic piece from my 97 F-150 door linkage, its the go-between for the rod that unlatches the door and the handle mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe original piece is a bit more intricate and I'm not sure if i want to replicate the whole thing or just enough to get the door working again :D\r\n\r\nBut ill keep the Sketchup file updated at least.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, if you can make it better, by all means make a derivative :D (I'm better in Sketchup than in OpenSCAD so this is what most of my Things will be)\r\n\r\nUploaded the OpenSCAD file for it. This one attempts to use a pin of some sort to keep it in the latch hole."
