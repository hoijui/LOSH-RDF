function = "My dirt simple spool holder. Got the idea from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6202 but decided to remake the vertex for slightly easier modification.\r\n\r\nCurrently the holder can be printed and accepts M8 or 5/16 threaded rods. The holder can be rendered to use less material in OpenSCAD but thats untested.\r\n\r\nThe foot is also untested but it should print fine :)"
