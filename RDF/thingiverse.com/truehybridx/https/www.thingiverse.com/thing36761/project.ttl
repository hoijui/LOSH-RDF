\r
Currently the Tag and Crest don't quite fit together :/\r
\r
I'm going to play with it in OpenScad and maybe make the pieces fit together better, unless someone beats me to it.\r
\r
Would like to keep as two pieces for painting, but whatever happens happens\r
\r
Tags and Crests the Digidestined were after in Season 1 to make their Digimon more powerful....\r
