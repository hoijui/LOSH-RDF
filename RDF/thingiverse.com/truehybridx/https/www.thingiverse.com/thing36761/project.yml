function: "Original Design by The Pixel Pot Project by WeIrDiE_InC from Trimble 3D Warehouse (Google Sketchup Warehouse)\r\n\r\nCurrently the Tag and Crest don't quite fit together :/\r\n\r\nI'm going to play with it in OpenScad and maybe make the pieces fit together better, unless someone beats me to it.\r\n\r\nWould like to keep as two pieces for painting, but whatever happens happens\r\n\r\nTags and Crests the Digidestined were after in Season 1 to make their Digimon more powerful....\r\n\r\nSketchup File Provided for tweakers who wanted more than the STL"
