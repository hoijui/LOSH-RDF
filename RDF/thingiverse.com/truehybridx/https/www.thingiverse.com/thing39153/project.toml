function = "I bought a couple geared steppers from Trinity Labs which ended up being the shorter shafts.\r\n\r\nLike a normal hacker I took a design I liked and worked it into fitting what I have on hand.\r\nSketchup did a surprising job with this :P\r\n\r\nV1 has the same exact holes as the original Tinkey Struder just with a wider back to line up the shaft a bit better. (I hope, currently testing)\r\n\r\nV2 has a longer base to fit mounts for greg extruders.\r\n\r\nI really needed the V2 only but figured I'd release them both."
