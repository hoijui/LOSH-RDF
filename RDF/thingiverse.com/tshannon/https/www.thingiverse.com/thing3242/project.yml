function: This is a small piece to be attached to the back of a desk.  It can hold 3 cords, and keeps them from falling behind the desk when they're not being used.  The ring diameters are custom for my cords (ethernet, vga, and audio) but they may work for you or you may be able to adjust the diameters to suit your cables.  It's attached with two wood screws through the cylindrical standoffs.
