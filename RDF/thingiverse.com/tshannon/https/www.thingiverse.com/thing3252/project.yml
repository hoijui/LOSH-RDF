function: "This is a shape that makes three orthogonal shadows in the shapes of the letters M, I, and T.  It was inspired by the cover of the book Godel, Escher, Bach (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GEBcover.jpg).  This was one of my first makerbot prints, but it came out pretty well.  With a bit more work, the photo can be much better, and the model could probably use a bit of tweaking as well.\r\n\r\nChoose your favorite 3-letter acronym and make something similar!"
