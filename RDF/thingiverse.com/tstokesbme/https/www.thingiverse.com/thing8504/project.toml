function = "This is based on a standard block from our lab. The two large holes accommodate 50mL tubes. The next size down handles 15mL tubes. The two smaller sizes are for centrifuge tubes, depending on how low and tight you want your tubes to fit and how many slots you need. We like to have a lot of these laying around so I'll probably print 10-12 before I'm done."
