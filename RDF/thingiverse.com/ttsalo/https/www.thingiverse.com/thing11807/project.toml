function = "This design replaces the stock mendel-parts.com Orca v0.20 Y belt end pulleys with pivoting ones which allow the belt tension to be adjusted by tightening a M4 threaded rod running under the ZY structure.\r\n\r\nThe advantage is twofold:\r\n- The belt tightness can be easily adjusted by turning the nuts in the M4 rod.\r\n- The rod compensates for the belt tension so that the belt tension no longer acts to bend the left M8 threaded rod. Otherwise tightening the Y belt may result in the Y rails becoming non-parallel and causing problems in levelling the print bed.\r\n\r\nNote: decreases the Z print area by a couple of millimeters, in my machine to 120mm."
