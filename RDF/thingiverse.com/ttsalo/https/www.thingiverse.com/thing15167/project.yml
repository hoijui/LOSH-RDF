function: "Development of Moineau pump: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7958\r\n\r\nThis is still under development, but the final goal is to develop this into a paste dispenser operated by a stepper motor and used in a 3D printer to form things from any paste-like material. For now, this operates with just a hand crank. Compared to the original, the rotation is reversed and the idea is to feed it from the top and have it push the pumped material out from the nozzle at the bottom.\r\n\r\nPrinted and tested (by hand) a very rough, smaller prototype. Some pumping action was seen with water-flour mixture, so it works on a basic level.\r\n\r\nPrinted and tested a spider coupling for driving the pump. Seems promising, the orbit of the rotor didn't seem to be any kind of a problem."
