The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever_tumbler_lock seemed like the best bet.\r\n\r\nSee it in action: http://youtu.be/Fzuhta2IQZ4\r\n\r\nThe model has three tumblers with 6 bitting positions for each. It's keyed [0, 3, 5].\r\n\r\nNote! The derived Fully Printable Padlock http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27205 contains an improved version of this mechanism."
