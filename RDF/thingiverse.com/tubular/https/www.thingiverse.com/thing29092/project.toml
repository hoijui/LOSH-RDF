function = "A parametric Cotton Reel constructed by mating two identical halves.  \r\n\r\nThe halves make it easy to retrofit to reprap rods without any disassembly (for a simple filament spool holder).\r\n\r\nAlso great for cable grommits, eg for closing up a hole in an enclosure or wall after you pass a terminated monitor cable through."
