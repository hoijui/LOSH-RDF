function = "If you happen to have an OpenPandora that has a weak hinge and doesn't stay open at angles other then 'fully open', you might want to try this bracket. It holds the lid open at about 130Â°. Use one in central position or two if you put the Pandora on a table; this way it doesn't lean.\r\n\r\nAttach the hook at the lid first, coming from the side of the Pandora. Then align the bottom part. You can now slide the lid holder to the mid of the Pandora or put another lid holder on the other side of the Pandora."
