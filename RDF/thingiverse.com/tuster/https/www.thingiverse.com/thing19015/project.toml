function = "This spool bushing is based on Thing #3783.\r\n\r\nI changed it to fit to the spools I got from reprapstore.com (3mm filament); they have a bigger (54mm diameter) hole. The bushing fits a 8mm rod nicely and can be used without any extra bearing. I recommend it without any bearing (for reasons of better friction of the spool). \r\nIf you still want to use metal bearings, have a look at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19014\r\n\r\nCheck out thingiverse.com/thing:19016 for the 8mm rod rack mounting thing."
