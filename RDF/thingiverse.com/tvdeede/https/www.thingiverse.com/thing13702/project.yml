function: "This item is a simple interface to use the 1Kg spools from Orbi-Tech in the 3D touch printer instead of their own plastic.\r\n\r\nI designed this thing as I had some of these spools and I want to empty them before purchasing any further material.\r\n\r\nUsed it for several prints now and it seems to work ok.  The plastic has the tendency to wrap around the bottom cylinder but that does not seem to prevent functioning as this cylinder is also turning on a bearing."
