function: "We found latest Prusa i3 printer design, the one Josef Prusa showed at Makerfaire this year in New York, for its elegant simplicity, but hinge like connection between Y axis assembly and frame needed improvement, in our opinion.  \r\nUsing CAD software we reworked Prusa i3 design:  \r\n- Laser cut frame was stiffen by adding two angle members connected to the rear side of Y axis assembly.  \r\n- Original, printed Z Axis mounting parts proven to be easy to break, which is why we replaced them with stronger laser cut parts.  \r\n- We did not like loose ends on Z Axis lead screw (similar to Printrbot design), therefore we added miniature flanged ball bearing on each side, to support lead screws on the top.  \r\n- All printed plastic parts were slightly changed, we felt that we should give them additional strength and better cosmetic appearance.  \r\n- Y axis assembly can be removed and installed back in a minute.  Convenient for transportation or shipment.  \r\n- Dimensions and axis travels of original Prusa i3 preserved.  \r\nTest print here:  \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZhU4h7qCJY  \r\nMore Pictures here:  \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/37863465@N03/8334662257/in/photostream/"
