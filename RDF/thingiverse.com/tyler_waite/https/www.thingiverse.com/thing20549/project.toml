function = "When I was thinking about a theme for my chess set, I wanted something simple and non-licensed. This represents an earlier day in the internet when the simplest way to show an emotion or even send a \"picture\" was to create an emoticon.  Each face represents a different piece as follows:\r\n:) - King\r\n:( - Queen\r\n:D - Pawn\r\n:/ - Knight\r\n:P  - Rook\r\n;) - Bishop\r\n\r\n(The corresponding labels are on the bottom of each piece.)\r\n\r\nI am a high school student, and a MakerBot would let my creativity pour out (through an extruder, of course).\r\n\r\nThis part was made with Tinkercad.
