function = "This is a component of the Free Universal Construction Kit, a collection of adapter bricks that enable complete interoperability between a wide range of popular childrenâ€™s construction toys. By allowing any piece to join to any other, the Kit encourages totally new forms of play across otherwise closed systems. As with other grassroots interoperability remedies, the Free Universal Construction Kit implements proprietary protocols in order to provide a public service unmet, or unmeetable, by corporate interests.\r\n\r\nThis is adapter uck-00f04m, which joins DuploÂ® to KrinklesÂ®.\r\n\r\nComplete information about the Free Universal Construction Kit can be found at http://fffff.at/free-universal-construction-kit."
