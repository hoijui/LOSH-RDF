function: the straight rods(8mm x 450mm) and the bushings were scrapped from 2 old printers, as well as the "manual transmission" handle, previously rubber rollers that drive the paper... all the screws and bearings on it were re-used from the original cupcake system with exception for 2 linear bearings on the bottom of the extruder platform and the universal adapter that connects the engine to the screwed rod.
