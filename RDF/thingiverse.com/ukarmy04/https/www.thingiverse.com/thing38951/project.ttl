    okh:function "This is a prototype Micro Spider-H Quad I've been working on.  The design is intended to replace the conventional wood designs that most people use for H-Quads.  The arms are angled outwards at 25 degrees so that any load encountered during a crash will be felt mostly as an axial load rather than a perpendicular load.  The center spine is arched upwards slightly, partially for aesthetics and partially because it helps the arms form a stronger bond with the spine.  I haven't been able to test/weigh this quad yet." ;
