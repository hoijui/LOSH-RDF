function = "I found that PLA fan ducts kept melting against the lower aluminium heat sink. I needed a low profile holder for the fan duct that also kept the top of the hot end clear.\r\n\r\nIt works beautifully.\r\n\r\nIt also makes it very easy to mount fans on both sides of the hot end for dual extrusion support."
