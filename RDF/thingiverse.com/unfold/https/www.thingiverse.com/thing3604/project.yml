function: These are the files for the first prototype of a clay extruding print head for a Bits From Bytes Rapman. Its a slightly improved version of the one we use for printing our initial ceramics objects (unfoldfab.blogspot.com). The design is based on the Frostruder by Zach Hoeken from Makerbot but uses one double action solenoid valve instead of two single action ones. It is important to note that it was never designed with elegance or easy printability in mind, its just a quick and dirty prototype.
