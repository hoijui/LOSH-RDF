function = "This is a simple reprap enclosure which also serves as a heated build environment.  It gets up to about 35-40 degrees C just from the natural heat of the reprap as measured on the inside-top with a laser thermometer.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, this seems to keep ABS smells in, and now that I've added a scrubber, even the inside isn't bad."
