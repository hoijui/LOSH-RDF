function = "I made a Sketchup model of the MakerBot so I could test out some paint schemes.\r\n\r\ncupcake.skp consists of all of the 5mm laser cut parts from Batch 3-4, with a slight tweak to remove the tape dispenser.\r\n\r\ncupcake-xy.skp has the all of the above plus the X/Y stages and all the rods.  Each part is created as a component and then grouped logically.  The display style is also tweaked slightly to speed rendering and look a little more realistic."
