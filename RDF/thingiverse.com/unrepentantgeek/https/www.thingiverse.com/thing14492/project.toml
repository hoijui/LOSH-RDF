function = "Inspired by the cantilevered Z stages of the Thing-O-Matic and Ultimaker I designed this upgrade for the Makerbot Cupcake CNC.  It should be possible to get 140mm of z travel with a standard x/y stage.\r\n\r\nI've designed it to fit a standard reprap extruder.  There's room for any extruder, the mounting holes for the makerbot extruder are just a bit too wide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a bunch of m3 nuts and bolts you will need a few bits of new hardware: 2 x 268mm lengths of 8mm smooth rod, 3 x LM8UU linear bearings, and an M8 Coupler.  You will also need to print one of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9622 to couple your z motor to the z rod.  For the z rod I just hacked down one of my z rods to 185mm.\r\n\r\nYou also need a popsicle stick, an m3 x 30 bolt (fully threaded) and a printed z-endstop-adjuster part.\r\n\r\nIf there is sufficient interest I've been pondering making an upgrade kit available."
