function = "I couldn't find a suitable cable clamp for my project, so I made one. Allows to attach a cable to a frame with 2 screws.\r\n\r\nFully parametric design, you can easily change the size of the clamp, the diameter of the cable and of the screws.\r\n\r\nThere are two clamp types :\r\n1) Half-clamp (blue) : two clamps can be attached together to prevent the cable from going through a hole.\r\n2) Full-clamp (yellow) : a single clamp can be used, screwed to a flat surface, to hold a cable.\r\n\r\nBoth types can be generated from the same OpenSCAD file.\r\n\r\nThis is my first published design, comments welcome."
