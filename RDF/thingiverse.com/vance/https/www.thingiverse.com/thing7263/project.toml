function = "This is a frame that a standard Arduino will snugly fit into, to get the circuit board off of the table.  Full access to all connectors is available, so it is useful during development.  The design can be printed on a 3D printer.  I printed mine on a MakerBot Thing-O-Matic in ABS plastic.  It is a preliminary design, which I hope to extend to an enclosing box later, but it seems like it might be useful to people."
