function = "Called micpod as in tripod. The micpod is the size of a microphone in the area that fits into the microphone holder. Put the micpod where a microphone should go to have a secure place to put your camera. So a regular mic stand is not that exciting. It can only go up and down. What is exciting IMHO is when you use this with a microphone boom stand. For those unfamiliar mic booms stands are what a drummer uses to sing.   \n\nThe micpod lets you place the camera on a steady mount where a tripod can't go. Full sized cameras are out for most mic booms.  \n\nThings that are in the weight area of microphones work great.  \n\nYou could also read/ watch your iPhone on the couch without holding it.  \n\nYou can get a closeup of your rapman while it is running and watch it from somewhere else. Out of babys reach directly above the crib might be fun too."
