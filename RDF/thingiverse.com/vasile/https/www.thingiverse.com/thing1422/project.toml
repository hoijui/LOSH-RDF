function = "This file contains one half of a clamp that can be used to mount a\r\n   camera on the edge of 1/8\" thick sheet of material.  The two halves\r\n   are identical, so two of them form the clamp.  Pass a 1/4\" x 20\r\n   bolt through the hole in the mount, fix the other side with a nut\r\n   (tighten until the clamp grips the material), and that bolt should\r\n   screw into the tripod-mounting hole on the bottom of your\r\n   camera. The camera will be held such that you can shoot pictures\r\n   parallel to the plane of the material.\r\n\r\n   To slide the clamp along the edge of your material, loosen the nut,\r\n   reposition, and retighten.  To change the height of the camera\r\n   above the plane of material, use shorter or longer bolts, or adjust\r\n   the length by placing a second nut on the bolt on the side of the\r\n   clamp where the head of the bolt is."
