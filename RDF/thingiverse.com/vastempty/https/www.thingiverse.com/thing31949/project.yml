function: "This is a Lacto Fermentation Lid for canning jars.  Heavily/completely based on the excellent work by AlexEnglish.\r\n\r\nI got started on Lacto Fermentation because of my daughters' ongoing GI issues. The doctors have worked around to trying prescription Probiotics.   Of course I had to learn all about it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see I have tried most of the popular jars; pickl-it (too expensive and a hassle to open and taste test your batch), Fido (I like), I also tried a simple mason jar and lid you need to bleed out the CO2 every 12 hours or it might burst (forget it).  Here is my contribution, a working and tested lid (yes that is my vegi mix in the center jar with the blue lid)."
