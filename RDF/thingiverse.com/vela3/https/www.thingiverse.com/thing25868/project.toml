function = "I think a clean and robust design such as the Orca deserves clean and robust cable handling. \r\n\r\nBased on Rotoscans derivate of Landrus cable chain I puzzled a chain on all the axis of my Orca. \r\n\r\nI made the holes 5% or so bigger so it moves easier. \r\n\r\nI allowed some backward bending, which is not a good idea. This I repaired (untested!) in the uploaded files. \r\n\r\nFor the next derivate it would be nice if the links can be opened. \r\n\r\nThe links for the Y must be a bit shorter for a smaller curve. The links for the Z can be bigger."
