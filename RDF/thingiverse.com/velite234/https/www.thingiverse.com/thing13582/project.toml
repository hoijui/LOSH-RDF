Use your imagination xD\r\n\r\nOr, if you don't want to use your imagination you can also check out this video:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcA4KHZOLG4\r\n\r\nThe quality is not great (and no sound, sorry about that). The one on that video is the X-12 (an earlier version) but the only difference is the nozzle.\r\n\r\nThis one was our first succesful launch with the same fuel the X-12B uses:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIAwVWGTbzU\r\n\r\nNot very impressive, but it was a lot of fun xD"
