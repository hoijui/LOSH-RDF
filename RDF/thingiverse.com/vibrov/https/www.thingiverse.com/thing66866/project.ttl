Since I liked the banana tuning from Jeremy: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45236  
but some people might not want to change their blocks. So I designed a working version that one can bolt on existing UM blocks.  

I prefer to use solid blocks from chasmaker: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22157. It allows me to bolt on the tensioner with small bolts.  

Use 10mm M3 bolts for mounting to chasmakers blocks. If you use longer ones for the tensioner check if endswitches work. Leave everything else original on the blocks. So if you have wooden blocks with long bolts already through them. Just remove the nuts. Screw back the bolts a bit and then use the tensioner as replacement of your nuts. So the tensioning bolts on the lever stay unchanged. It's often just a hair of adjustment extra needed.  

Cura settings: .4mm nozzle and wall thickness, 100% infill.  
Rotate the tens-case stl file 180 else you have to bridge. Solidworks messed up. Troubles rotanting the assembly.  

Solidworks parts and assembly added. Do with it as you please. Please do improve.""" ;
