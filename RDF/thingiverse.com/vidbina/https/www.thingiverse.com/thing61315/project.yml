function: "A finger ring casing for a smart device to your liking. Keep your gadget close!\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm working on the circuitry for a HID, this idea came to me during the Artefact of Society Design Course I completed on Coursera a little while ago.\r\n\r\nImagine a mouse, a clicker, a remote, a quantified-self ish gadget, all rolled into one. Obviously I will mostly focus on the development of the mouse/clicker device, but everyone is welcome to hack something awesome into existence.\r\n\r\nThe current model is still one seamless piece, I still need to complete the model and add a seam to allow user to open the case and place their hardware within. Just so you know ;)"
