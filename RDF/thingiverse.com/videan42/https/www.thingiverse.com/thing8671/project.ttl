\r
This is my first experiment with using OpenSCAD.  A friend of mine is making an NES case mod and he needed a unicorn horn (don't ask).  I searched through Thingiverse, but all I could find were prints for the pen plotter.  Clearly, this needed to be fixed.\r
\r
The design is just a parametric spiral with a bit of an offset to make it seem twisty and more natural. It's made entirely with blobs, which gives it a really cool texture when it prints.\r
\r
I tried to put in pins for alignment, but I could never get them to print cleanly enough.  The spiral was a good enough guide for me, but someone who's better at OpenSCAD might be able to get it to work.""" ;
