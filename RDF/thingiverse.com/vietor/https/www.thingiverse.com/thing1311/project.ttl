    okh:function "I thought it would be point less to publishing this, but after seeing \\\"Sumobot Chassis by langfordw\\\" I said to my self why not. The EEEI Robotic http://ieee.rutgers.edu/robotics/ club at Rutger was inviting all student to joint the line following competition to build a robot from a kit. More detail description of the kit can be found here http://ieee.rutgers.edu/robotics/attachments/069_Kit_Description.pdf. They also made four classed meeting once a week for student who have no skill in soldering or programing to assemble the kit. After the four classes student have two week to prefect their bot before the competition. The kit costs $65, but since I already had Atmega sitting alone in a box I decided to get the kit without the Freeduino for $45. I got chance to use the Atmega and learn how to program it. I could not let this opportunity just pass by." ;
