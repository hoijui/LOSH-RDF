function = "I made this bike mount at my good friend's request. The mount is fairly heavy duty. The estimated cost is $0.80 of ABS material at $0.02 per cc. I printed it with a honey comb structure making it strong for vertical compression. As a tip, I recommend coating the mount with epoxy for easy clean up and then paint it with a \"Sharpie\". Enjoy."
