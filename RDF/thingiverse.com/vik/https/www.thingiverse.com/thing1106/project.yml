function: "This is a reprapped replica of a traditional type of adze made by the Maori in New Zealand. The blade is usually made from pounamu, a type of nephrite closely resembling jade. Fine specimens are often worn as jewellery in the form of a necklace pendant. The bindings are traditionally native flax, but I have taken the liberty of using PTFE threadseal tape for my version.\r\n\r\nCredit: Bronwyn Holloway-Smith (http://bronwyn.co.nz) and Vik Olliver CC-BY-SA"
