function = "This is a reproduction of a \"tea bowl\" that I'm doing for an exhibition. I mean, I did a spoon http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1109 , right, so a bowl was a natural progression. I don't claim it to be water-tight, but there are no actual holes and the mesh is manifold. It's quite large - 150mm diameter and 75mm high.\r\n\r\nThe neat bit though is that if you look at the bottom the edges hang over at more than 45 degrees. I found this was possible if you get it just right on circular objects as the nozzle tries to wrap the existing edges of the object with extruded filament as it orbits.\r\n\r\nCredit: Bronwyn Holloway-Smith (http://bronwyn.co.nz) and Vik Olliver CC-BY-SA"
