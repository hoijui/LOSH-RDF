function = "Our kitchen working surface gets covered in washing up liquid every time our washing up brush gets left or knocked around. So I created a holder in the vain hope that people will stand it up and our kitchen will be just that little bit tidier.  \n\n\n\nEven if you don;t lean the head over the feet it's still pretty stable.  \n\n\n\nI even remembered to include drainage holes, but do squish the water out of the sponge before storing or it'll dribble all over the windowsill."
