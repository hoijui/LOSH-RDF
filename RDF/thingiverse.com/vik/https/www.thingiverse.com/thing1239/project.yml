function: "Pairs of poi are swung around by M\xC4\x81ori in a creative way, usually in rhythm and particularly well (I think) by the ladies. Traditionally made by stuffing bundles of native flax, these days kids make them from plastic shopping bags. As disposable shopping bags are a bad idea, I've made some that can be raprapped in two halves and stuck together.\r\n\r\nCredit: Bronwyn Holloway-Smith (http://bronwyn.co.nz) and Vik Olliver CC-BY-SA"
