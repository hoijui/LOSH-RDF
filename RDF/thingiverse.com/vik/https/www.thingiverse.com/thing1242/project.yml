function: "M\xC4\x81ori fish hooks don't work by penetrating the fish. Instead, they slide over the front of the fish's lower jaw and grip it with large barbs. This allowed the M\xC4\x81ori to improve their catch, and thus expand their population. The discovery of the design is traditionally attributed to the demigod Maui.\r\n\r\nCredit: Bronwyn Holloway-Smith (http://bronwyn.co.nz) and Vik Olliver CC-BY-SA"
