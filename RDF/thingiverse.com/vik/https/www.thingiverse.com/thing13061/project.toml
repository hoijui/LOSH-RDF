function = "This prints as a set of two parts: A well shaped a bit like a volcano with a filling crater at the top, little tunnels to let ants into the crater, and a lid with a centring stem to keep the rain out. The aim was to have something stable I can put ant poison out in without worrying about what our stupid cats will do.\r\n\r\nThe shape I settled on is a broad, flat cone for stability and to lower aerodynamic drag - it's vaguely reminiscent of the tornado ground cameras. The central well is a 45 degree cone to discourage sloshing and to make it more likely that your RepRap will produce a watertight object!"
