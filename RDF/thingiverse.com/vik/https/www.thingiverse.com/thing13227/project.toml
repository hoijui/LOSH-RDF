function = "This adapter slides on to an airgun \"10mm\" dovetail as found on my Cannon 737 (Sharp Innova). The rail is slightly split so that the clamping action of the scope closes the adapter up on the 10mm dovetail.\r\n\r\nNot sure how much abuse it'll stand up to on a spring airgun but seems OK for pneumatics."
