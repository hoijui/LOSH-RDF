function = "This is something I made to hold two asthma inhalers - preventer and reliever - on the desk or bedside table. The damn things roll away down gaps at the slightest excuse, causing trouble for the now purple owner. This holder corrals them neatly, and gives you somewhere to put change, hearing aid, glass eye etc. as well.\r\n\r\nParametric SCAD files provided for those not using standard inhalers."
