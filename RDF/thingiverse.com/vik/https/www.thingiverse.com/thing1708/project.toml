function = "Four of these feet will support a Mendel deposition bed. The semi-circular recess rests on the Y rails, so no bearings are required. The bed can be levelled by tightening the 2 Nylok nuts on each foot, thus compressing the spring structure.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the two M4x40 machine screws are recessed into the attachment bracket, and three small holes are provided. These nicely take No.4 3/8\" to 1/2\" countersunk or pan-head woodscrews - the SCAD file has an option for it.  The M4 screws are held captive by two nuts which are recessed, so no washers needed there.\r\n\r\nThis allows just one layer of bed to provide an adjustable flat upper surface for deposition."
