function = "This is a clamp that attaches directly to the underside of the Mendel deposition bed when used with http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1708 feet. Like the feet, it used No. 4 1/2\" countersunk woodscrews or equivalent. The belt is clamped in place by 2 M4 nuts, M4 washers and M4x16mm machine screws.\r\n\r\nIt's kinda neat in that it uses the mess caused when trying to cap a hexagonal hole as a means to entrap a nut."
