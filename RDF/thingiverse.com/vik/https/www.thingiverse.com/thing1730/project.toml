function = "This is a one-piece design for the Mendel X motor bracket. The clamps are all built-in. All M4 nuts are captive where possible, and only two idlers are provided for the X axis belt to run over. Additionally, there are two loops positioned so that a 50mm PC cooling fan can be used to cool the X motor. This may be necessary if you're hunting for speed and making the X motor a trifle warm!"
