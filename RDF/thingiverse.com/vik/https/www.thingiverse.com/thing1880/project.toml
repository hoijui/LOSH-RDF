function = "This is a modification of the Y bar clamps, and comes with a shelf sticking out of it to stick optical or mechanical limit sensors on. It clamps onto 8mm or 5/16\\\" rod for those who still work in old money.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that non-standard endstop mechanisms can be stuck to the shelf, allowing experimentation with microswitches etc.\r\n\r\nThere is also a part equivalent to the PCB spacer in the standard Mendel that is used to close the clamp after it is attached to the bar (doesn\\'t show well in the STL image)."
