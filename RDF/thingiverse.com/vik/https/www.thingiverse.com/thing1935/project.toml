function = "This parametric version of the Mendel Extruder has even more parametrisations and a captive nut & bolt to stop the stepper motor from sliding away from the pinch-wheel. It also has holes to allow two woodscrews to be driven through the sides of the PTFE instead of epoxying it in place. This allows repairs and upgrading of the extruder without the use of a chisel.\r\n\r\nAn M4x40 screw is now used to strengthen the M4 stepper motor adjustment screw, and a cutout allows one of the two M4x40 mounting screws a little more room so a washer can be used underneath its head."
