function: "Solves the dilema of where to tuck one's hose away safely. Girls do not like to disconnect hosepipe fittings, and so it is easier to create a tap-like holder for the hose to nest in, where it can be used for rinsing hands and tools. \r\n\r\nThe tap in our garden is at watering can level anyway, so repositioning the end of the hose makes it easier to wash tools off etc. without cricking your back. As the water flow is usually slow when you do this to avoid soggy sleeves, the kink in the hose doesn't seem to matter much.\r\n\r\nAlso, you now know where to find the damn thing!"
