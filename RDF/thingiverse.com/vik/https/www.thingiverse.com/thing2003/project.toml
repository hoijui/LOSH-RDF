function = "This derivative of the Mendel frame vertex part has the option in the SCAD file of having a foot. The default file has one. I\\'ve oversized the holes slightly so that even people with wonky printers in development stand a chance of having a part they can use directly without having to ream the M8 holes out.\r\n\r\nUsing vertices with feet helps prevent the Z gears and drive hitting the table or objects that have rolled under the Mendel."
