function: "Using a file without a handle on is a potentially dangerous concept, what with this spike being moved around rapidly in front of you and with great force, often in the squishy part of your palm. Much safer and more comfortable to use a handle on it. Also you can hang them up with the loop provided in the handle, or use the handle to stop them dropping through your tool rack.\r\n\r\nTwo sizes are provided as STL's below in the traditional manner; too big, and too small. Fortunately they scale well. You can see it in use at 2:20 in this video: https://youtu.be/riJ47nAv7Bs"
