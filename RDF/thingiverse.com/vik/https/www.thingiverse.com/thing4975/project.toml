function = "I noticed that the Wade didn't print out well without support, so I hacked my DC Wade variant to use a stepper motor. This design uses the same driven gear and bearing block as the standard Wade and my DC variant. I have added a collar to the drive gear to extend it past the motor bracket.\r\n\r\nThis updated design has a thicker motor bracket, more room for the drive gear, shorter fixing slots for the stepper, and simplified mounting for the dual 608 bearings on the driven shaft."
