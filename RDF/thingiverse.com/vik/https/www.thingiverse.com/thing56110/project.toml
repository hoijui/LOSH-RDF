function = "This design slips on to the slide handles of your lathe or mill (http://machineryhouse.co.nz/L159 is the exact model used) and allows it to be driven by a stepper motor. This can be as part of a full CNC/computer setup, or a simple, repetitive task controlled by an Arduino. The drive gear is easily removable, and the motor is slack when not driving."
