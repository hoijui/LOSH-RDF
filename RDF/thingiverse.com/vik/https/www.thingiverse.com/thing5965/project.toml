function = "This is a plug designed to go in the upper holes of NFT and similar hydroponics runs. It is not entirely waterproof, but will help stop rain entering your system and diluting the nutrient. More importantly, it cuts out the sunlight and prevents algal scum growing in the run immediately beneath an empty hole.\r\n\r\nOh, and it keeps frogs out."
