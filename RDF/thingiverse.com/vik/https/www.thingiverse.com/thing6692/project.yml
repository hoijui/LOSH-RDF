function: "When you want to mix up some 2-part epoxy, there are never handy things to mix it up in. Well, problem solved. Not only that, but it comes with a little spatula that's flat at one end and pointy at the other.\r\n\r\nYou can re-use these a few times, and if using PLA and \"organic\" epoxy, you can even burn it up at the end of its life with a relatively clear conscience.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I sell PLA bioplastic filament at Diamond Age Solutions and am having an ethical dilemma over whether I should optimise this design..."
