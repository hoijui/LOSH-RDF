function = "This is a modified Prusa Mendel X Carriage that will fit the standard Mendel X axis. It uses PLA bushings instead of the standard bearings.\r\n\r\nThe main difference is that it will clamp to the Mendel drive belt using the 2 clamps provided in the design.\r\n\r\nA secondary difference is that it will hold the double-Wade seen in the background of the photo (details coming soon)."
