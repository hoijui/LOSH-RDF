function = "Here's a model of MjÃ¶llnir, Thor's Hammer ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mj%C3%B6llnir ), scaled to the same size as an artefact found at BredsÃ¤tra in Ã–land, Sweden. Not quite up to the same standards of workmanship, but it'll do for a start. There is a hole for a cord in the handle, and the SCAD file is parametric so you can easily change it's size and shape without altering the size of the cord hole."
