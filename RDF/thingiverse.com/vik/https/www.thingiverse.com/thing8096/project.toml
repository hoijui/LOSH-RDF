function = "We have a hand-wound impeller fan bellows for the log fire in the dining room and it makes a devil of a racket when you turn the handle. My wife hates it so I made a much quieter version that runs off a couple of AA batteries. Basically it is http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7350 with a handle and battery holder stuck on, but I've improved the parametrics a bit.\r\n\r\nIf I run it off 12V it beats my 110mm forge blower!"
