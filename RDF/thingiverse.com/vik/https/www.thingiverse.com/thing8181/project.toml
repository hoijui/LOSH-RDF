function = "Croc clip leads have this bad habit of going wandering. I even seem to have some that wandered in to my workshop. So I need something to give their little jaws some exercise on, and simultaneously keep them organised and close to hand.\r\n\r\nIt's much safer than letting them chomp on passing mains leads and adaptor cables.\r\n\r\nThis one is slightly flexible, so I can do things like screw it to wooden pillars. If anyone takes that out of context, I'll sue."
