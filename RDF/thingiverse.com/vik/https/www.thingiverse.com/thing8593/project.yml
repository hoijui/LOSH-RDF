function: "I had two things: A broken penknife on my desk, and a need to showcase the new Silver PLA at http://diamondage.co.nz/pla.html - preferably with something shiny. Like that knife blade. Ahah! I now have a light handle that fills my hand well and has a nice lanyard hole too.\r\n\r\nThis handle is configured to accept a 2.5mm x 25mm x79mm blade with a 6mm pivot hole. The OpenSCAD file is parametric though, so you can fiddle around to suit whatever blade you happen to have at hand or knock up in the forge."
