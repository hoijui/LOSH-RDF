function = "This is a bearing race for a thrust bearing. It just needs two M8 washers and 8 x 4.5mm (0.177\") ball bearings of the kind normally fired from BB guns. It was designed for the bearings of the RepRap Darwin Z axis, but is a generally useful little widget. Including washers, it occupies approximately the same space as a 608 bearing.\r\n\r\nA set of 4 of these bearings has been in constant use for 1 1/2 years with no issues."
