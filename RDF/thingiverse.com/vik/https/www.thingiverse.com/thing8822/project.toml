function = "This is my second modified Prusa Mendel X Carriage that will fit the standard Mendel X axis. It uses PLA bushings instead of the standard bearings. These now clip in place and have pins on top that locate into generous spaces in the carriage. This allows the user to optionally bond the bushings in place by dropping glue, blu-tak, gum, earwax etc. into each hole.\r\n\r\nThis is designed not to fix to a Prusa Mendel, but to clamp to the Mendel drive belt using the 2 clamps provided in the design.\r\n\r\nTwo pinch extruders http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8830 or one Wade extruder can be fitted to the carriage."
