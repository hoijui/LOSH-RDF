function = "Simple filament pusher using a dc reduction drive from Jaycar, a couple of microswitches and a skateboard bearing. The drive gear is a brass shaft coupling hobbed with a M4 tap as per: http://reprap.org/wiki/Wade's_Geared_Extruder. Simple design just made to suit what I cound get hold of. BOM and photos to come once I get it off the printer!\r\n\r\nAs the printer requires more filament the microswitch is depressed and the motor starts supplying more until it catches up and then turns off. I chose a slightly smaller motor which runs much quieter and runs at 70rpm from 12V.\r\n\r\nSet up with a second microswitch wired to machines E Stop so if you finish the reel or something bad happens things stop!\r\n\r\nVideo if it in action:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/An926fPPbcY\r\n\r\nPlease post if you want the Solidworks files"
