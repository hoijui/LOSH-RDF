function: "A very simple upgrade for the SeemeCnc H1 printer is replacing the idlers for the belts with ball bearings. Using the stock bolts this means we need a sleeve to go from the 1/4\" cap screw to the 8mm ID of the bearing.\r\n\r\nThe bearings are cheap readily available skateboard bearings. Also known as 608 size. Measurements:\r\n22mm OD\r\n8mm ID\r\n7mm height\r\n\r\nThis is quite possibly the second simplest STL on thingiverse after a cal cube!"
