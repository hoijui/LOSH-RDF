function = "We needed some items for individuals to decorate and arrange at an elderly center.  It turned out to be easier to design in Blender than 3D scan a scrappy real leaf from the yard.  This leaf fit the bill and it turned out to  be an excellent subject to fine tune my Carve and Fill settings for a thin object in Skeinforge.  11 quality \"leaves\" printed and only 20 more to go."
