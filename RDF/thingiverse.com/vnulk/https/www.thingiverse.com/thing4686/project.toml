function = "I saw a photo of this toy in a woodworking magazine and thought it would be fun to make some toys for the grandkids.  I believe the wooden version would hold positions more easily than the slick plastic so I sharpened up features to ease stacking.  Standing 3.25 inches high will not be a choking hazard and 5 or 6 will be a welcome addition to the toy box."
