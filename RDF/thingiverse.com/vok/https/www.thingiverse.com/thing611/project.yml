function: "A decorative thimble designed in TopMod, using the method described in the shotglass tutorial which is linked from the shotglass object:\r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:434\r\nAfter TopMod (the .obj file), this was resized and converted to .dae using Meshlab so that it could be printed by Shapeways.  Here is the object at Shapeways:\r\nhttp://www.shapeways.com/model/27961/collector_s_thimble.html\r\nThis was basically my first attempt at 3D design; the tutorial was extremely helpful.  \r\nI'd be curious if anyone tries to print this with Makerbot or RepRap.  One note is that it lacks the support between the inner and outer layers that is described in the shotglass tutorial, so I imagine that would need to be added.  I think the thinnest surfaces and smallest gaps are a bit under 2mm.  The outer dimensions are a bit large for a thimble; that was so that Shapeways could print it (my first attempt had been too thin)."
