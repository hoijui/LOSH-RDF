function = "This is the hardware for an alarm clock that supports many alarms.  The design is not yet tested, and the firmware has not been written.  This schematic was made using Eagle 5.6.0 with the Sparkfun eagle library.  ENC1 is a Grayhill 61C11 rotary encoder, pins 4 and 5 provide quadrature outputs while 2 and 3 are either side of a momentary switch.  Timekeeping is handled by a DS1307 RTC chip.  Alarm is indicated via buzzer and flashing Luxeon LED.  I expect there to be errors, if you find any, let me know.  I'm still making the BOM and working on PCB artwork.  Most specced components in this design are surface mount.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I've just put up a new version of the schematic.  I moved around the resistors and LED a little to make the schematic clearer.\r\n\r\n-VE3HOP"
