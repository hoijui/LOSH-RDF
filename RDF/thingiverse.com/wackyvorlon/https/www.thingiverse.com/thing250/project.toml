function = "An important part of electronics is recognizing functional blocks that form larger circuits.  This schematic is a drawing of a basic amplifier.  R1 and R2 form a resistive voltage divider to set the gain of the amplifier.  If you replace one of these with a potentiometer, you can adjust it.  This circuit will work with just about any op-amp.  EAGLE 4.16 format."
