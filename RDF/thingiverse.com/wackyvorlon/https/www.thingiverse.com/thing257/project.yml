function: This is a light I made for a friend, intended to mimic the flicker of a fireplace.  This schematic represents the design as I made it - it wasn't until later that I realized I could have just as easily replaced the ULN2803 with a single TIP120, ah well.  I haven't breadboarded the circuit with a single TIP120.  I used an attiny45 instead of the attiny13.
