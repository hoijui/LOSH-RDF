I created this to make small trays for screws and other small parts, but the parameters can be changed to make other similar objects (bowl, cups, etc).  A few example stl files are included.  \r\n\r\nFor square trays, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:43406  \r\n\r\nFor round trays with lids, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:44535  \r\n\r\nThe lids are compatible with these trays as long as the sidewall and diameter match.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Printer:**\r\n--[Afinia H480*](https://www.amazon.com/Afinia-H480-AFINIA-3D-Printer/dp/B00ISIV1QI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1455258411&sr=8-1&keywords=afinia&linkCode=sl1&tag=whirligh03-20&linkId=f9361e957929d53402884fed662b8e02)\r\n\r\n**Filaments:**\r\n-- [Octave Flourescent Green ABS](http://thrinter.com/walters-filament-collection-abs/#octave-fgreen)\r\n-- [Octave Flourescent Yellow ABS](http://thrinter.com/walters-filament-collection-abs/#octave-fyellow)\r\n-- [Octave Blue ABS](http://thrinter.com/walters-filament-collection-abs/#octave-blue)\r\n-- [Octave Glow in the Dark Blue ABS](http://thrinter.com/walters-filament-collection-abs/#octave-glow-blue)\r\n\r\n**affiliate link*"
