function = "Shell for a Pentax D-LI90 based USB charger.  The D-Li90 is used by the Pentax K-7, K-5 and K-01.  \nI use it to keep my phone (which I use as a gps) charged while backpacking.  The nice thing about this is a 'dead' battery that won't work in my camera still has plenty of charge to keep my phone topped off."
