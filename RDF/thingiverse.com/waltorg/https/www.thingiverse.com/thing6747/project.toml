function = "Dig out those old prescription glasses you've had sitting around forever, design a rad new frame, print it out, pop in lenses.....pick up chicks!\r\n\r\nThis is a derivative of Prusajr awesome working glasses!  I redesigned in Google sketchup and split into smaller units to allow printing on a makerbot and easy customization.\r\nI was too anxious to try them out and did not design a hinge to allow folding.  I will work on a new design later.  Super glue seems to work great.  I did not include the STLs since you really need to edit the Sketchup file to fit your particular lenses."
