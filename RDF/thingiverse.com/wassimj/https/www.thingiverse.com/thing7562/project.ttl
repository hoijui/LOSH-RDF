    okh:function """I made this geodesic dome as my first experiment using Autodesk's 3DS Max Design 2011. I was inspired by Buckminster Fuller and his domes. I exported it to .STL and scaled it up in replicator-G to print on the Makerbot ToM with Stepstruder MK6. It took 45 minutes to print. You can see more images at:\r

I was worried that the top might collapse since there is no support material, but it held up.. The very top is a bit 'messy' and blended in, but it held up just fine. It is nice to see it build in rings getting smaller and smaller as it goes up.""" ;
