function = "I mostly hacked Jonas KÃ¼hling  work, so all the credits go to him\r\n\r\nwhat did I do?\r\n\r\nI converted from LM8UU to LM12UU and from M3 screws and nuts to M4.\r\n\r\nI also made the whole thing thicker and put a bigger mouthplate with added nut holders. \r\nIt helps me greatly to glue the nut in the nut holder and then just turn the screw.\r\n\r\nI also added a small end stop for the LM12UU. As I will use those holders to mount my Z axis in my CNC I thought that maybe the added support is worth the extra plastic."
