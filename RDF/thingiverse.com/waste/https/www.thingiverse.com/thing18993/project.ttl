\r
what did I do?\r
\r
I converted from LM8UU to LM12UU and from M3 screws and nuts to M4.\r
\r
I also made the whole thing thicker and put a bigger mouthplate with added nut holders. \r
It helps me greatly to glue the nut in the nut holder and then just turn the screw.\r
\r
I also added a small end stop for the LM12UU. As I will use those holders to mount my Z axis in my CNC I thought that maybe the added support is worth the extra plastic.""" ;
