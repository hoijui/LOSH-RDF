function = "I noticed a serious lack of Parallax Propeller related projects on Thingiverse, so I decided to make a holder for a QuickStart Board I received.\r\n\r\nBased on oomlout's original Arduino holder design, I made a similar holder for the QuickStart Board. Jessica Uelmen from Parallax came to our Hacker Space, FamiLAB, and gave an instructional class on the boards. I made this to hand out to the students."
