function = "Derivative of Adafruit's Raspberry Pi Case. As of time I made the original case, Adafruit's SVG did not show the correct dimensions in Inkscape. So I took out some calipers and measured, and resized. May be a TAD bit too large, but the Pi fits well, and does not move too much.\r\n\r\nI also added the Raspberry Pi Logo, added some heat venting holes, and added some holes on the top that fits Radioshack 276-150 Perfboards."
