function = "I printed some wrenchs for our FabLab ( http://www.nybi.cc), as an idea for a possible gift during exhibitions, a sort of business card or something like that...\r\n\r\nWe have slogans such as \"hacking ergo sum\", or \"in bidouille we trust\" and they are already here if you want to print them ^^\r\n\r\nBut since I took some wrench from the google warehouse, changed some things (inverting faces, rotating bits, to make it printable...) and removed the existing text to had mine, everyone can make their own personalized wrench quite easily in Sketchup8 :)\r\n\r\nThey are not intended to be used as real wrenchs, but maybe that can work if you don't need to tighten things with too much force (and are also possibly not metric, I haven't checked)."
