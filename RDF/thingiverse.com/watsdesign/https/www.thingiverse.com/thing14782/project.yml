function: "In 2008 I made the first tree of this kind, and always wanted to upload it.\r\nThe idea behind is to have more than 2 pieces slotted together and finally to obtain something closer to a real tree. For that the tips is to divide the height to have as many sections as used panels : 6 in this case, resulting in larger notches corresponding to the thickness/angle of the accumulation of panels.\r\n\r\nThis tree may also serve to hang little jewelry :)"
