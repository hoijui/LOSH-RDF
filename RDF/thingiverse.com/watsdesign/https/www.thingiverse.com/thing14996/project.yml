function: "A little redesign of the cap holder after some suggestions of my father :)\r\nHoping to making it simpler and more practical.\r\n\r\nThe bottom and perfectly flat face will hold the cap, even more, thanks to a sort of lip like the original thing (due to the first layer being usually more squished than the next ones); while the support, once removed, will leave a sort of grip on the attach.\r\n\r\nSupported diameters : 40.5-77mm for the common known diam. (52mm in the pictures)\r\n\r\n(If you wonder about the file name: \"s\" mean \"support\", because the initial versions were without; while \"p\" is for \"pente\" because the side is not straight for a more pleasant contact when grabbing the cap.\r\nHere is also a 80sec. making-of the 49mm holder http://youtu.be/jQms74oR9hY )"
