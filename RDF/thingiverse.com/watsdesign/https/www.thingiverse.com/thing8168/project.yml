function: "After seeing how http://www.my3dscanner.com works I wanted to give it a try.\r\n\r\nA leather glove on a quite dirty cutting mat were good textured things (enjoy these rules of imperfection), and hard to model otherwise.\r\nI was surprised by the result of this first try and the simplicity of the process. With just a backlight to avoid the shadow it would be even better !\r\n\r\n(I'll maybe upload an stl if I can pursue the reconstruction, or someone else ^^)\r\n\r\n[edit:]\r\nSee : http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8229\r\nAnd http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8232 for the printable version !"
