function: "I broke my frame, and my friend Tony offered me to help design a new one (he was an eyewear designer for some years).\r\n\r\nThat's not perfect yet, but it's already cool :)\r\n\r\nhttp://watsdesign.blogspot.com/2011/05/glasses-for-everyone-in-progress.html\r\n\r\nUltimately I wish we could make a parametric design, maybe with a cool interface like magic-box:\r\nhttp://magic-box.org/tool/?url=http://magic-box.org/designs/presentation/glasses.mbt&state=viewer\r\n\r\nAnd thus allowing almost everyone to make their own glasses in a fablab (a lasercutter is certainly better for this job).\r\nIn the same philosophy of these two other project:\r\nhttp://www.thethirdteacher.com/ourvoice/march-12-2010-%E2%80%93-do-it-yourself-eye-exam/2010/03/12\r\nhttp://fuseproject.com/category-6-product-45\r\n\r\nBut with more diy-open-source-freedom :)\r\n\r\n[edit 04 aug 2011:] Just discovered http://www.oyoglasses.com/ maybe they will allow mass-cutomization of 3d-printed glasses"
