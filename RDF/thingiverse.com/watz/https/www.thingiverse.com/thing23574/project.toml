function = "A version of the Bre Pettis Polhemus scan reduced to a low polygon state, after which I've outlined the polygon edges with boxes to form a lattice geometry from the original structure. \r\n\r\nThis was done with my Modelbuilder Processing library, specifically with UGeometry.loadSTL() and UPrimitive.box2points(). The output is a mess of overlapping meshes, which must be cleaned up in Netfabb or similar. Download BreTest01 LoLoPoly.stl if you want to see the low-poly STL that was used as input."
