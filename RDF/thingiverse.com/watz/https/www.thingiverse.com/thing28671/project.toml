function = "Something I put together to get a gauge for how certain types of geometry features might print at different sizes. Hardy scientific, but still useful for reference. \r\n\r\nSince the horizontal resolution of a Makerbot isn't so great I've set  it up to be printed vertically at a 15 degree angle with a supporting structure, which seems to be working well. \r\n\r\nI'm including a flat version in case anyone wants to print it horizontally or modify it in any way."
