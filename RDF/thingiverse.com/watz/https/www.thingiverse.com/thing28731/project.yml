function: "I made these printable 8mm connector bars to work with the \"Platonic Solid Vertices\" thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9359. Printing the bars gives the final structure a nice consistent look.\r\n\r\nThe bars are cut at one end to make them stick to the platform, but the round parts make them a good fit for the vertices. I hollowed them out somewhat to be economic about material, but I later realized that the hollow might actually add to the printing time. The thin lines help prevent individal pieces coming loose, I'm having problems with lift so I added the lines as a makeshift precaution. They break off easily once printed. \r\n\r\nThese bars are 12 cm long but can obviously be scaled up (not in ReplicatorG, though, that would scale the radius as well as the length.)"
