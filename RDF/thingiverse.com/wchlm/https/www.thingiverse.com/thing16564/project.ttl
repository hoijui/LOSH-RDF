\r
I didn't care if it bulked up the iPod somewhat. In the end, it's still comfortable in a shirt pocket, either fully coiled or partly uncoiled for listening. However, if the reason you stopped smoking was that the cigarette pack was too uncomfortable in your pocket, you might not like this device.""" ;
