function = "An OpenSCAD design for an iPod wire manager based on measurements of whatever portable music player you own. It does not actually have to be an iPod, but all connections have to be on the bottom. \r\n\r\nExcess earbud wire can be wrapped on the spool behind the iPod. Slits permit the wire to be \"tied down\" at an appropriate length for your current use -- e.g., shirt-pocket length. Or the wire can be fully wrapped when the device is not in use."
