function = "The hinge connecting the head of my desk lamp to the arm broke, leaving the head dangling. I made a new one. It's not perfect (it's a little bit loose around the head, and the peg the hinge is on is too short), but it works.\r\n\r\nLamps get hot. I won't be responsible if your lamp melts this holder and burns your house down. You have been warned."
