function: "After running the extruder nozzel into my glass clip, I was determined to find a better solution.  Enter SUGRU, a silicone based putty that hardens overnight, retains elasticity and resists high heat.  I simply placed Sugru on the edges of the glass plate and heat bed and let it set up overnight.  Now I have a surface with no obstructions.  I implemented this in May 2012, and have used it with no problems since (still working April,2016).  My heat bed runs at 100 degrees C.\r\nI have no affiliation with Sugru, but I think it's a great product."
