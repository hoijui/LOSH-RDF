function: "As a guideline I had this very beautiful design of reprapdiscount:  \r\nhttp://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26093  \r\nBut it was impossible for me to change it in a way to make it easily printable. So I decided to make my own version. But I wouldn't do it without using the excellent professional made little elastic kill button.  \r\nWhile I created this case I had neither the LDC board nor the LCD. So \"Hardwarekiller\" send me, very exactly, all the needed measurements by email - and everything's fit well."
