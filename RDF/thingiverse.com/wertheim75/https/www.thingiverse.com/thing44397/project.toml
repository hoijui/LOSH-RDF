function = "A modified derivative of the Illusionist Locket.  This is a derivative of mctrivia's design. \r\n\r\nThe original design needed a few adjustments for fit and finish.  I added some geometric dimensioning and tolerance and reduced the overall required material a bit.\r\n\r\nAdded a tab to connect to necklace or lanyard of your choice.\r\n\r\nAdded 4 picture areas to the inside of the locket. (Roundish depressions) or enough room to hide something small like a microSD, hair clipping, jewel, etc.\r\n\r\nThe doors may come off but the dimensions are tight enough that you almost need to remove them on purpose....which you can do if you want different pics in them.  \r\n\r\nThe plates won't come off once glued."
