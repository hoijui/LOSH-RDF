    okh:function """This is a test for testing an idea I came up with while struggling with the raft.  What this test does is to print a raftless cylinder with a one layer thick base.  Unlike the ordinary raft, the base is to be trimmed instead of detaching.  In this way, we have the quality bottom of a raftless print and the strong grips as if printing with raft.  \r
\r
The most interesting thing is the thin base behave almost like a thin sheet of metal. If you keeps folding it back and forth along the object silhouette, the base will break precisely at the silhouette leaving a clean shiny bottom; and you can do it with bare hands, no tools needed.
