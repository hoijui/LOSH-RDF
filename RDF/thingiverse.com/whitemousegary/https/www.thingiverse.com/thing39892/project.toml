function = "I'm using some thumbscrews http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13778 to make my makebot platform level, which works great.  However, I just keep rotating the screws in wrong direction, especially whem I'm doing it with left hand.  So, I modified the thumbscrew design a little bit.  I replaced the symmetric teeth with two non symmetric shapes, so I can tell which direction to rotate simply by touching it."
