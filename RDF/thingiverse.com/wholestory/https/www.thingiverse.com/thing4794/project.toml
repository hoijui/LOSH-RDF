function = "This is a generic ring with pave diamonds.... lots and lots of diamonds and lots and lots of prongs.  The stl file had almost 300,000 facets on it.  It's about 83 Megs when unzipped.  I only put diamonds on one side so that, hopefully, there would be no need for supports for the prongs.\r\n\r\nI was thinking it would be cool to print this file out on a Cupcake and then print it out on a Thing-o-matic (when it comes out) to compare the resolutions.\r\n\r\nI made it in a CAD package called Firestorm (which is built on a CAD package called SpaceClaim).  If anyone wants the SpaceClaim file, just ask."
