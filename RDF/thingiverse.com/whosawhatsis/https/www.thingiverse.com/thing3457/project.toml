function = "This script generates a teardrop shape at the appropriate angle to prevent overhangs greater than 45 degrees. The image shows a 45-degree rotation (no teardrop), a 60-degree rotation (shallow teardrop), and a 90-degree rotation (full 45-degree teardrop). This allows you to make holes at any angle that are as round as possible.\r\n\r\nI actually came up with two solutions to this problem, because a bug was making my first solution take FOREVER to calculate. The second solution is still in the file, but has been commented-out."
