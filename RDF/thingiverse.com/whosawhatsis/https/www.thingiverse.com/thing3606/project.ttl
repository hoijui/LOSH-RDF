\r
I was going to modify the x-blunt-plate_1off and x-motor-end-clamp_1off parts for this function, then try to cut passable replacements out of the acrylic left over from my froglet, but when I opened the files I found that none of the existing holes were properly aligned (it looks like someone just eyeballed them), I concluded that those pieces, like the x carriage, need to be thrown out and redesigned from scratch.\r
\r
Not wanting to go to all this effort to design parts that I wouldn't be able to print or test without negotiating the chicken/egg problem (and knowing that others trying to build their first printer from the parts output by the currently available production files would have the same problem), I chose to seek a solution that didn't require a printer (though the parts could probably be printed, too). The parts pictured are cut from 22-gauge sheet metal with tin snips and a power drill.""" ;
