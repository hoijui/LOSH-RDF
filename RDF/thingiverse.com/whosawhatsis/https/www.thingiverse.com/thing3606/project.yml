function: "These pulley extenders fix the alignment of the x-axis belt on on the Mini Mendel Huxley so that the clamping side is properly aligned, and (more importantly) so that the belt does not rub against the chassis on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nI was going to modify the x-blunt-plate_1off and x-motor-end-clamp_1off parts for this function, then try to cut passable replacements out of the acrylic left over from my froglet, but when I opened the files I found that none of the existing holes were properly aligned (it looks like someone just eyeballed them), I concluded that those pieces, like the x carriage, need to be thrown out and redesigned from scratch.\r\n\r\nNot wanting to go to all this effort to design parts that I wouldn't be able to print or test without negotiating the chicken/egg problem (and knowing that others trying to build their first printer from the parts output by the currently available production files would have the same problem), I chose to seek a solution that didn't require a printer (though the parts could probably be printed, too). The parts pictured are cut from 22-gauge sheet metal with tin snips and a power drill."
