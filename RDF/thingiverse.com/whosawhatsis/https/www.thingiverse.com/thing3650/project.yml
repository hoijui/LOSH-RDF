function: "This is the power resistor heater block described by nophead on http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2009/01/yet-another-quick-heater-hack.html (nophead, if you want to make a thing for this, I'll take this one down and post my pics as a copy, or I can just change the license to one of your choosing) made from the kit available from http://www.makergear.com/products/ceramic-heater-core (choose \"Power resistor heater kit\"). The power resistor acts as a heating element to heat an aluminum block around the heater barrel, replacing the nichrome in other hot end designs. It's installed in my oversized Mini Mendel Huxley (which has BARELY enough space in the bottom of the X carriage. Hopefully the radiating heat won't screw up the carriage, but I plan to make a new one when I get it printing anyway.\r\n\r\nThingiverse is flipping some of my pictures upside-down for some reason, I'll try uploading them again later."
