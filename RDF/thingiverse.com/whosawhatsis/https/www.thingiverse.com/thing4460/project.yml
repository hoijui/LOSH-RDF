function: This is a simplified and modified version of Prusajr's PLA bushings. This is another try at a modified version to act as a 180-degree bearing to prevent binding. This version does not allow for as much mis-alignment as my other 180-degree bushing, but it will work as a drop-in replacement for the 360-degree bushings, so that the carriages do not need to be modified. To avoid over-constraint, the ideal arrangement has two 360-degree bushings on one side, and one of these 180-degree bushings on the other side.
