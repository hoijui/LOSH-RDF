\r
Edit: whistle version added. Blame tbuser.\r
\r
Edit: Added pics of a print WITHOUT SUPPORTS! And no cleanup. When it tried to print the bottom of the tentacles, it just kinda made a mess, but that mess built up enough to become a support structure in mid-air. This structure was initially flexible, and was dragged around by the head for a few layers, which is why the tentacles are pointy even though the bottoms were cut off by this. Even the stringing looks appropriate. I am ecstatic about how this came out.\r
