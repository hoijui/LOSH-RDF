function = "This is a ramp that slides in under the SD card slot on the Makerbot motherboard. It makes it a little easier to slide the card into the slot, and keeps it from slipping behind the board. It makes a big difference if your card slot is not as accessible as you might like (so that using it requires holding your fingers at an odd angle to align the card)."
