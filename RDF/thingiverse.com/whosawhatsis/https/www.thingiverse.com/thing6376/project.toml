function = "This is a ramp that slides in under the SD card slot on the Makerbot motherboard. It makes it a little easier to slide the card into the slot, and keeps it from slipping behind the board. It makes a big difference if your card slot is not as accessible as you might like (so that using it requires holding your fingers at an odd angle to align the card).\r\n\r\nThis version has walls, because wulfdesign wanted them and it was a really easy addition."
