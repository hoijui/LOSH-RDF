function: "This is a sphere made of gears. The hub of the gears is off-center so that the surface breaks up when the gears turn.\r\n\r\nThis is based on emmett's cube gears ( http://thingiverse.com/thing:6073 ), but with a lot of improvements to the script. Rendering still takes a long time at first (as much as 10 minutes for this version), but I've added caching so that you don't have to wait that long every time. The render statements I used to do this also stop the OpenCSG renderings from looking like something homicidal impressionist clown with dyslexia painted during an earthquake. I also made the animation work, though even with the caching it won't exceed a few fps. The most important thing, though, is that I added a module to the parameters section to define the shape to cut into gears. You can now make gears out of any STL just by dropping the \"import_stl\" into this module."
