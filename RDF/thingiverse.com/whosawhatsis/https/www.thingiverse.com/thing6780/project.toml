function = "This is for mounting the Extruder Controller and Relay board to the side of a Cupcake CNC. The boards stick out a bit above the top of the side panel, but are still below the Z belt. The big improvement over other EC board mounts is that the bracket mounts to the Cupcake body with two screws instead of one, so it won't pivot the way my previous mounting solution did."
