function = "I was showing off some of my designs at a recent Makerbot user group meeting, and I wished I had tags for them with QR codes and some other relevant data. This bookmarklet will generate such tags.\r\n\r\nNote: I initially set the license to CC-BY for the example picture because the CC licenses look a little nicer on the tags, but I've changed the license to PD, so feel free to use it however you want.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Some errors were reported with the DOM walking, so I rewrote those portions to use Regex instead. This should improve compatibility."
