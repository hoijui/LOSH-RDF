Note: I initially set the license to CC-BY for the example picture because the CC licenses look a little nicer on the tags, but I've changed the license to PD, so feel free to use it however you want.\r

Update: Some errors were reported with the DOM walking, so I rewrote those portions to use Regex instead. This should improve compatibility.""" ;
