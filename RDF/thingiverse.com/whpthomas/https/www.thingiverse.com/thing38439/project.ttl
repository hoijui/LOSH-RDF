__UPDATE__  

If you are having problems with corners lifting, I have uploaded another version (wRafts) with tear-off ear rafts to increase the surface area and make it stick down better.   

This spool holder was designed using an ACIS solid in Shark FX (sfx file included) so will behave well with Makerware, ReplicatorG and skeinforge.""" ;
