function: "I tried a few other 30 x 100 spool holder designs, but I wanted something that printed as a single part, was designed for the Replicator 2, made it easy to load and unload spools and held them securely in place.  \n\n__UPDATE__  \n\nIf you are having problems with corners lifting, I have uploaded another version (wRafts) with tear-off ear rafts to increase the surface area and make it stick down better.   \n\nThis spool holder was designed using an ACIS solid in Shark FX (sfx file included) so will behave well with Makerware, ReplicatorG and skeinforge."
