    okh:function """When it comes to filament changes, I have often found myself fumbling around trying to get the filament into the tiny end of the tube at the back of my Replicator 2. Buy the time I get the filament threaded  the print head has often cooled down substantially, making filament changes slower.\r
\r
So I designed and made this quick change easy filament guide to streamline the process. It supports dual tubes, so you can mount a filament tube on either side. The  filament guide is designed to be held in place on your Replicator 2 by a small zip tie. \r
\r
This filament guide works like a funnel, with a large opening at the bottom leading into the tube, it makes filament changes quicker and easier.""" ;
