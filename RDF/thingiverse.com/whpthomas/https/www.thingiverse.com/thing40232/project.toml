function = "Every time I unscrew the heat-sink fan screws to remove the stepper motor, I find the fan guard flops about and gets in the way. So I have created this retaining clip that simply snaps into place and holds the guard firmly against the fan regardless of whether the retaining screws are removed.\r\n\r\nI recently upgraded my fan to a 24v 40 x 40 x 10 mm ball bearing fan which has a higher CFM air flow but lower RPM - so its much quieter. Highly recommended upgrade! \r\n\r\nThis clip was designed using an ACIS solid in Shark FX (sfx file included) so will behave well with Makerware, ReplicatorG and skeinforge."
