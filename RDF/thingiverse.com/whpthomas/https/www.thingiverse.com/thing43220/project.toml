function = "Yet another spool clip - this one is designed to be printed in PLA. Because its flexible, it is compatible with MakerBot and 100mm x 30mm spools and most likely many others.\r\n\r\nUPDATE Jan 22 2013\r\n\r\nI have created four different clips sizes to accommodate reels with different flange widths.\r\n\r\nS = 3.0mm\r\nM = 3.5mm\r\nL = 4.0mm\r\nXL = 4.5mm\r\n\r\nThis clip was designed using an ACIS solid in Shark FX (sfx file included) so will behave well with Makerware, ReplicatorG and skeinforge."
