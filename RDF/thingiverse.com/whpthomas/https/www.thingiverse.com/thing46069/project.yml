function: "I recently purchased this acrylic hood and side panels from BilbyCNC in Australia.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bilbycnc.com.au/DisplayProd.asp?ProdID=cncRepHood\r\n\r\nThe hood didn't come with any mounting hardware - so I designed this set of hinges, which mount using the existing Replicator 2 socket head cap screw M6 threaded holes on the back of the printer. I also re-designed my YATH tool holder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38949 to work as a side panel retainer.\r\n\r\nThe hinges work very nicely, allowing the hood to be vertically self supporting when open. Internal plates are used to minimise stress on the hoods acrylic panels.\r\n\r\nThis extruder upgrade was designed using an ACIS solid in Shark FX/ViaCAD (sfx file included) so will behave well with Makerware, ReplicatorG and skeinforge. I have included STEP files that can be imported into other CAD programs."
