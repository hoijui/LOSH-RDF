function: "This is a toothpick holder designed to make cleaning your Replicator 2 extruder nozzle, quick and effective. With the extruder drive assembly removed and the nozzle pre-heated, you insert trimmed toothpicks into the top of the hot end with a circular downward motion. Repeat the process to clear out any burnt PLA until the toothpicks come out clean. Then use a sanded down pin to clean out the 0.4mm nozzle tip. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis toothpick holder was designed using an ACIS solid in Shark FX/ViaCAD (vc3 file included) so will behave well with Makerware, ReplicatorG and skeinforge."
