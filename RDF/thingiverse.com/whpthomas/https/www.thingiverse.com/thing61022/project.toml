function = "Looking to install and use ReplicatorG-Sailfish on your Replicator 2?  \n\nHere is a step-by-step guide along with Skeinforge profiles tuned for the Replicator 2 that will get you started with 120mm/s printing and all the other wonderful Sailfish trimmings. There is also a test object you can print to confirm you are getting the kind of output you should expect.  \n\n###UPDATE (28 April 2013)   \n\nUpdated profiles for ReplicatorG 40(r16) with full 5D pre-prime. I now advise using a combination of firmware de-prime and retraction. Set the firmware de-prime to 16 steps in the onboard preferences. The â€œRetraction Distanceâ€x9d in the Skeinforge â€œDimensionâ€x9d module in these profiles will be set to 2mm.  \n\n###UPDATE (27 Mar 2013)  \n\nI have added a bash script for downloading and installing pypy on the Mac. You will need to run \"chmod 755 install-pypy.sh\" before you can execute it from the terminal. See the installation guide for details."
