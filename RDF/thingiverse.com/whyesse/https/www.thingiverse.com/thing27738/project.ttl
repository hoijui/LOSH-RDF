"Micropul is an abstract strategy tile-laying game. It is usually played as a 2-player game in which players take turn placing tiles and stones, stocking new tiles and claiming groups. Micropul can also be played as a solitaire puzzle where the goal is to play optimally and beat your previous score."\r

\r
Update (6/8/2012): The tiles should interlock now. At least, my test prints do. I still haven't tried printing a full set yet.""" ;
