function: "(Almost) everything you need to play Micropul (http://neutralbox.com/micropul) with 1 to 3 players!\r\n\r\n\"Micropul is an abstract strategy tile-laying game. It is usually played as a 2-player game in which players take turn placing tiles and stones, stocking new tiles and claiming groups. Micropul can also be played as a solitaire puzzle where the goal is to play optimally and beat your previous score.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate (6/8/2012): The tiles should interlock now. At least, my test prints do. I still haven't tried printing a full set yet."
