function: I hate leaving my headphones laying on the desk, but I couldn't find a good sized-hook or mount for them. This is sized to slide onto a 1-inch thick surface, and hold headphones beneath the desk (especially if you put a little anti-slip putty on the side that sticks on the top of the desk. It will print on a Thing-o-Matic, but's probably too big for a Cupcake.
