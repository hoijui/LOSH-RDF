function = "I built these to serve as scale models for a project I'm working on. I wanted to absolutely confirm that they'd fit together as intended before I spent a bunch of money on materials and wasted a bunch of time. \r\n\r\nIn the STL files, each component square is about 1 3/8-inches across. As long as you keep them at the same scale, they'll join together as you'd expect.\r\n\r\nI don't expect this model to change much. It was created in 123D Design. If you'd like the original source files, leave me a comment and I'll post them."
