\r
In the STL files, each component square is about 1 3/8-inches across. As long as you keep them at the same scale, they'll join together as you'd expect.\r
\r
I don't expect this model to change much. It was created in 123D Design. If you'd like the original source files, leave me a comment and I'll post them.""" ;
