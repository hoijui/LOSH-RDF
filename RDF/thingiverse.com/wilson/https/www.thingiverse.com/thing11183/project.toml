function = "Seeing tc_fea's Taj Mahal inspired me to upload this version that I printed a few days ago.  I found a model on google warehouse and simplified it to make it printable.  I didn't hollow it out but definitely should have.  This thing is big, too big for a makerbot.  It took up most of my prusa platform and took something like 12 hrs to print even with very low infill."
