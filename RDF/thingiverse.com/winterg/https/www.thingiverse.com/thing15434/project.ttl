    okh:function """Have you ever built a bunch of LED throwies for a project and then lamented when they all died out before you had the chance to integrate them into a project? Well! This LED throwie uses a magnetic reed switch to save energy by only turning on the LED once the throwie comes into contact with a magnet stuck to a metal surface. \r
\r
The LED switching circuit consists of a ultra bright LED with the positive lead (longer lead) connected to a magnetic reed switch and the positive side of a 3v lithium button battery. The negative lead of the LED is connected directly to ground.\r
\r
The enclosure itself was built on a Makerbot Thingomatic and was coded in OpenSCAD.""" ;
