function: "I\\'ve noticed that there are alot of Google Android related stuff on Thingiverse (G1 docks and such) so I have 3D modeled the lovable Google Android so that all of you Google fans may print and display your commitment to the open source smartphone movement! (Or print it just for kicks... I\\'m actually a Iphone user *Sigh*.) Anywho, here it is!\r\n\r\nPS: If you haven\\'t figured it out, the Google Android Guy is a logo created and shared by Google.
