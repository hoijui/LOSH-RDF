function: This is a derivative of Neufeld's "Mounting Bracket for Three 3.5-Inch Drives in Two 5.25-Inch Drive Bays" and features clearance slots for the metal support tabs present in most desktop tower mounting bays that *normally* aid in drive alignment during installation. Without these clearance slots, it is not possible to install neufeld's original mounting brackets as the drive support tabs inhibit the brackets from spanning the entire bay.
