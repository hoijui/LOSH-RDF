function: I made this hat after hearing that Marek Michalowski and his unbelievably cute robot Keepon were going to stop by at Makerbot's Botcave. Sadly I did not have enough time to optimize it for printing and it was never printed. I am posting this hat as a work in progress in the hopes that later this weekend I will have the time to flatten out all of the overhangs or someone might make a printable derivative and repost it to Thingiverse.
