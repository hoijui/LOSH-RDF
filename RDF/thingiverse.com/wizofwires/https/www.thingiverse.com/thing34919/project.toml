function = "Printable inserts to fit wall and floor box plates.  Starting off with serial/monitor DB connectors.   Heavy DB is a clip-in fitted for 4, 6 or 8 port wall plates.  Narrow DB is a recessed clip in for 4 or 6 port  floor box covers.  Both layouts provide flush insertion depth   and are intended for solder on connectors.  This design requires the insert to be slid over the wire then soldering can be accomplished before clicking the insert into the plate.   See instructions for details and links."
