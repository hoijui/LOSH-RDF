function: Replacement for the cheap, fragile valence hanger extension bracket for our vertical blinds. Original was cast in clear plastic but, over time, the plastic became brittle and the clips broke that attached it to the horizontal rail. When designing the replacement I heavily reinforced the clips, printing with ABS allowed me to greatly increase the gripping power.
