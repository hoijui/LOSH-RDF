function = "The use of multiple Xtion's/Kinects will cause interference in the depth-readings. \r\nVibrating the devices will decrease the interference. \r\n\r\nThis is a mount to attach a dc motor (diameter 24mm) to an Asus Xtion Pro or Asus Xtion Pro Live. The motor will have an off-axis weight attached, so it will cause a vibration.\r\n\r\nThis was designed for a project of robotics research group of the Production engineering, Machine design and Automation department at the Katholic University Leuven"
