    okh:function """This is a replica of the "Perched Rock" near Lee's Ferry and Marble Canyon, Arizona. It was first photographed by William Bell in 1872 as part of a USGS survey of the American West. A version of his original stereoscopic view is here: http://www.klettandwolfe.com/ImageDetails/BellsRock.jpg\r
\r
This model was derived from pictures I originally made for a "walk around" photo-animation: http://www.klettandwolfe.com/2010/12/a-walk-around-william-bells-perched-rock-lees-ferry-arizona.html\r
\r
The pictures were stitched in Catch123 then further modified in Meshmixer. The top of the rock isn't accurate as a result of my lack of expertise with Meshmixer.\r
\r
Other variations on the idea include a walk into the historic stereoscopic image: http://www.klettandwolfe.com/2009/10/a-walk-through-.html and a large scale stereoscopic panorama that requires a custom-built viewing device: http://www.klettandwolfe.com/ImageDetails/JumboStereoViewer.jpg""" ;
