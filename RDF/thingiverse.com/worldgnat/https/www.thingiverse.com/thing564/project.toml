function = "What personal hygiene item might you need in a hurry and want to print out of plastic? That's right: a comb. I could find no combs on Thingiverse; this situation needed to be remedied. It's my first model in Blender, so it's a little bit ugly, but probably functional. I would appreciate any suggestions or criticisms you have to offer.\r\n\r\nNote: I don't have a Makerbot/3D printer (yet), so I haven't actually printed it, but it looked alright in skeinforge.\r\n\r\nUpdate: The corners have now been rounded out a bit, and the model has been enlarged a bit so that skeinforge can print the teeth more easily."
