function = "It bothers me when ubiquitous parts, such as motors, must be bought. Hobbyists make tiny motors for RC planes etc, but they require fairly specific custom parts. I tried to design similar parts so that they are more easily available.\r\n\r\nI decided on a brushless design because it seemed like it would be easier to print, and because after some research it seemed that it is harder to design a reliable brush motor than a reliable brushless one. A lot of my inspiration/information came from this page: http://www.flyelectric.ukgateway.net/cdrom.htm, and it would probably be helpful for assembling the printed parts as well. \r\n\r\nI'm a little out of my league here so I have no idea if this will work, but it's worth a shot. I don't know how many people want to actually print a motor and spend the time winding and preparing it rather than just going out and buying it, but maybe it could be useful.\r\n\r\nFor some bizarre reason the entire center has a bunch of non-manifold holes, which I really don't understand (I selected the vertices one at a time and created the faces individually). I suspect this has something to do with the fact that I created the stator by connecting multiple objects together, but I don't know how to fix it. I'd really appreciate if someone could help me out here. I'll post the .blend file as well in case that helps."
