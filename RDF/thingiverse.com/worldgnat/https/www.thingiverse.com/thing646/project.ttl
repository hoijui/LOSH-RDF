    okh:function """It bothers me when ubiquitous parts, such as motors, must be bought. Hobbyists make tiny motors for RC planes etc, but they require fairly specific custom parts. I tried to design similar parts so that they are more easily available.\r
\r
I decided on a brushless design because it seemed like it would be easier to print, and because after some research it seemed that it is harder to design a reliable brush motor than a reliable brushless one. A lot of my inspiration/information came from this page: http://www.flyelectric.ukgateway.net/cdrom.htm, and it would probably be helpful for assembling the printed parts as well. \r
\r
I'm a little out of my league here so I have no idea if this will work, but it's worth a shot. I don't know how many people want to actually print a motor and spend the time winding and preparing it rather than just going out and buying it, but maybe it could be useful.\r
\r
For some bizarre reason the entire center has a bunch of non-manifold holes, which I really don't understand (I selected the vertices one at a time and created the faces individually). I suspect this has something to do with the fact that I created the stator by connecting multiple objects together, but I don't know how to fix it. I'd really appreciate if someone could help me out here. I'll post the .blend file as well in case that helps.""" ;
