function = "I'm debugging my newly built Cupcake CNC, and I wanted a small object that would give me a way to test changes to the bot and to skeinforge. I wanted a simple test that would take as little of my precious ABS as possible. So I created das kleine Testmaenchen, or the little test man. Why in German? Because it sounds more awesome in German. (Thanks to Zaggo for correcting my German)\r\n\r\nIt's a quick, 2 minute build, and it takes under 1cc of ABS."
