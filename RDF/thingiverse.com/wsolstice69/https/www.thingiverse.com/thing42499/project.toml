function = "This is a bracket designed to hold the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Module or similar sonar module, and allow it to be mounted to a servo motor shaft or a flat surface.  (Note: this holds the module with the connection lead pins facing up, for my application I replaced the L shaped lead pins with straight pins)   This should hold the module via a friction fit, however you can also use a small bit of foam mounting tape for a better hold.  I have tried this out on a couple of different HC-SR04 modules and found that the tolerances in the component placement on the modules are not very tight, so I have included the .scad file if you need to make any modifications.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you found this useful.\r\n\r\nHere is one for a micro-servo http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1960232"
