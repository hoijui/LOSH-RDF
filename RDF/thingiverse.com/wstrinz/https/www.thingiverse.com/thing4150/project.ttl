    okh:function """So I decided I'd use my makerbot to make my girlfriend a new bike light for her birthday. I've been using the new sketchup's solid modeling tools, which are extremely useful and quite fun if you have access to them. The only problem I have with them is the difficulty of editing components once they've been fused together. Additionally, I worried the light I got might not be bright enough. I've seen a few bike lights on thingiverse, but they all seem to be for one particular type of flashlight. So I decided to make my design a little more modular and easy to adapt to most any kind of flashlight.\r
\r
As of now there are 3 components:\r
The main light housing - I made this to fit a small LED flashlight, but if you scale up the size of the cylinder, or push a hole through the bottom of it, you could make it pretty easy to adapt to any other flashlight.\r
\r
the bike attachment - this should fit most handlebars, but would be pretty easy to scale up or reshape for other ones\r
\r
the connecters - these connect the main light housing and the bike attachment. One gets printed attached to each other component. keep these the same size relative to one another \r
\r
So if you want to modify it, just edit each individual component in sketchup to make it fight your bike or light! Again, I found the solid modeling tools to be invaluable in sticking it all together, but you should have the tools to do most of it even with the free version.""" ;
