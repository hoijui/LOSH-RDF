\r
Wanting to be done with it and move on to printing with the Prusa ASAP I took the existing "608 Ball Chain Idler with matching Pulley Hack" and 'differenced' out the 'pulley' portion and exported the .stl\r
\r
Then Changed the shaft diameter to 8mm (for the zRod) and output that to .stl, Flipped it over, and combined then in Rhino. (one stl object on top of the another effectively bonds them as one object).\r
\r
I apologize that it's such a hack job but it prints (and hopefully works great) and got the job done.""" ;
