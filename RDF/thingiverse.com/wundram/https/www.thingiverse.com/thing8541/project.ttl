    okh:function """A stellated truncated dodecahedron.  It is also the logo for Mathematica.  My first two attempts were cut from 3/32" clear acrylic.  The third is 1/8" tinted acrylic.\r
\r
I calculated the angles for the triangles and connectors using Mathematica.   The angles for the connectors were 65.0126630 degrees,  152.13568896 degrees, and 164.70420180 degrees.  The triangles are isosceles triangles with a base of 1 inch, and a base to side angle of 111.4999145471926 degrees and a side length of 1.36425707926833 for the tall one.  The short triangle had a base to side angle of 123.53604428357949 degrees and a side length of 0.90504049664228.\r
\r
(Due to an ordering error, the tinted acrylic was .110" instead of 1/8", fortunately I noticed this before I cut the connectors, and so I was able to adjust the slot with in the connectors to compensate for this.)""" ;
