function: "A stellated truncated dodecahedron.  It is also the logo for Mathematica.  My first two attempts were cut from 3/32\" clear acrylic.  The third is 1/8\" tinted acrylic.\r\n\r\nI calculated the angles for the triangles and connectors using Mathematica.   The angles for the connectors were 65.0126630 degrees,  152.13568896 degrees, and 164.70420180 degrees.  The triangles are isosceles triangles with a base of 1 inch, and a base to side angle of 111.4999145471926 degrees and a side length of 1.36425707926833 for the tall one.  The short triangle had a base to side angle of 123.53604428357949 degrees and a side length of 0.90504049664228.\r\n\r\n(Due to an ordering error, the tinted acrylic was .110\" instead of 1/8\", fortunately I noticed this before I cut the connectors, and so I was able to adjust the slot with in the connectors to compensate for this.)"
