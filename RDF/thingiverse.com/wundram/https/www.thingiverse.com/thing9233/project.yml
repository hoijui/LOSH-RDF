function: "I'm working on an openscad script to generate cuts for a sliceform of a openscad form.  This takes advantage of the new 2d features of openscad and the dxf export.  I have had issues with the dxf export and compatability, this have been fixed in the latest development snapshot, so that is what I am using now.\r\n\r\nThis project was inspired by the RACKO thing by JSP7707."
