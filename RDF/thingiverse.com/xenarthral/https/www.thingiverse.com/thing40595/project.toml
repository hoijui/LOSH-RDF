function = "Penrose tiles have 5-fold rotational symmetry, but no translational symmetry, making them well suited for puzzles! This is a laser cut design that makes Penrose tile puzzle pieces.\r\n\r\nThere's a bunch of other great Penrose tiles on Thingverse (16184, 12003, 15021). This design is a kite-and-dart variation that has interlocking jigsaw puzzle-like edges."
