function: "I was searching long time for an usfull adapter for iphone 5 which i can use for every holder out there on the market.\r\nBut all out there don't work well. So i desidet to do one on my own.\r\n\r\nThis one is my first version. It work with every standard iphone 4 stand. So you don't have do buy a new one. And it works with most car holders. I used it for my vw passat."
