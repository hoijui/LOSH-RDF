function = "I skeinforged (41) this at 0.35mm layer 1.5/1.5 pwot/iwot with 100% fill at 48mm/sec feed.  I started printing it and it caused such bad shuddering on the small infill that it caused major missed steps and killed the print.  My sprinter accel settings are default.  I tried setting max start as low as 1 but that did not help...still need to try lowering the accel speeds."
