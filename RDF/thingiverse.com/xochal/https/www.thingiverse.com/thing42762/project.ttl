    okh:function """Here is a few clips i have been working on the clippy clip is the wire clip that opens v2 of it i have yet to test.  the twist clip deceptively named because it pushes in not twist... it is 15mm thick and is just a 14mm ring.  UPDATE clip 2 Failed miserably...  I think i fixed it its back on the que to print! Clip 2.1 is the updated version it has a higher sere angel and rests further open.  Springs were returned to original thickness.\r
