function = "UPDATE 4/23/13:  Added Version 2.5  it includes addition wire clearance and some clean up for eaiser printing.  \nenjoy! V2.5 is for LM10UU bearings only.   \n\n\nI wanted to maximize use of my x axis here is my solution.  I am running a version from earlier in the design process this one is improved to use less plastic,minize cooling stress on ABS and to fix a problem with the fan  \n mounting.   \nI plan to print this one as soon as i have some time!..   this is printed vertically so its super strong.  listing as a work in progress untill i have printed this iteration or some one else reports that it works.  the side fan mount is super adjustable in an attempt to utilize it on several different carriages and get a good fit with what ever shroud you are using. the picture is the earlier version i am running now.   \nUPDATE 2/6/13 ADDED version 3 for use with bronze bushings that have a outside diameter of 16mm.  if you need a different out side diameter just tell me ill put more up  \n\nThings to do: make a lm8uu version.  Add 15.9 16.1 and 16.2 versions to account for for printer Cal varaitions.   Use my test bushings to figure out if the 16mm version will work for you!"
