function = "this is a set of test bushing to figure out what size you should size your holes to make a 8mm brass self aligning bushing fit properly.  \r\nI designed it so someone else could tell me what size i should make the holes when i modify my x carriage for brass bushings. (i dont have any on hand)  \r\nthe test bushings have the actual size printed on them.  \r\nUPDATE: 2/4/13 to clarify the marked size is the inside hole size."
