function: "I redesigned the model which this was derived from including a much improved locking ring, a D shaft for the center piece, one piece end caps and reduced ability to pick. also it is scaled up about 120%  because of the compete redesign the parts are not interchangeable with the original.\r\nI have only printed in PLA if you print in ABS please report how well the lock ring works."
