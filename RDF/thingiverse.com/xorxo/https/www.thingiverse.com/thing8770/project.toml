The main problem was that the overhang parts bent upwards and at some point the nozzle kicked one of the three parts around.\r\nTo avoid this i added some parts which hold the overhang parts down.\r\nUsing this support parts the knot prints very nice on my TOM with MK6 starting from the first layer.\r\n\r\nThe support was added using OpenSCAD, so you can modify it if you like.\r\nIt might be a bit more support than needed, but with this models i do not need to get nervous while printing them..."
