\r
I had some trouble printing the original one because i did not want to omit some of the first layers. The main problem was that the overhang parts bent upwards and at some point the nozzle kicked one of the three parts around.\r
To avoid this i added some parts which hold the overhang parts down.\r
Using this support parts the knot prints very nice on my TOM with MK6 starting from the first layer.\r
\r
The support was added using OpenSCAD, so you can modify it if you like.\r
It might be a bit more support than needed, but with this models i do not need to get nervous while printing them...""" ;
