I had the idea of using the 6 birds from Angry Birds and using them as chess pieces. The King was the original red bird, because he's useless, but he's still the classic angry bird. The Queen is the black/kamikaze bird. The Rook is the Yellow Bird, because it shoots itself forward. The Egg/White Bird, in my head, traveled diagonally in the game (dropping the egg). The Knight is the Green/Boomerang Bird, because it moved in the L shape that a knight on the board does. The pawn was obviously the small, innocent looking baby blue birds, but just like pawns, can be vital at the right times. \r
