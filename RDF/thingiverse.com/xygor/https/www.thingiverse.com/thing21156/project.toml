function = "Derivative of thing:5007.  Bigger to allow RAMPS clearance and to allow the future addition of a cover.  Also an Arduino mounting hole is moved.  I don't know if it is wrong for everyone, but it was wrong for my Arduino Mega 2560.  Plus some other embellishments added: Vertical reinforcing ribs and protrusion on the rod-side face to clamp the rod better."
