    okh:function """This is a support pin as found on adjustable shelving. Usually when you get a bookcase or some furniture it comes with extra pins. For some reason I can never find those extra pins when I need them.\r
\r
These printable pins work well as a replacement and they're quite small so you can print a handful of them in an hour. \r
\r
These are designed to fit my bookcases and provide a snug fit in the 0.185" holes. The peg diameter as described in the STL file is actually 0.19" which I discovered by experimentation provided the best fit for my printer and shelves.\r
\r
The image with the blue background is a rendering of the model to give a better perspective on the shape.""" ;
