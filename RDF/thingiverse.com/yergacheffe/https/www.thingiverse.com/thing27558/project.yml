function: "This is a vacuum hose adapter that allows a Shop-Vac 45mm hose to connect to a Kent CNC dust collector which has a 4\" diameter vacuum port.\r\n\r\nThe Kent CNC dust collector I just purchased has a threaded 4\" vacuum hose connection, so this has an interior thread on the 4\" section that fits directly onto it very snugly.\r\n\r\nThe other end allows a push-fit onto the 1.75\" hose from my Shop-Vac.\r\n\r\nI largely work in SolidWorks these days, so that's the CAD file format uploaded here."
