function: "This allows you to connect two ends of an ANSI MXL sized timing belt together. You can use this to take a length of belt and turn it into a loop.\r\n\r\nIt's designed to fit very snugly on the belt, so you may need to use a small flathead screwdriver to push the belt into the coupler. It provides a very solid joint.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to make this parametric in OpenSCAD. I needed to knock something out quickly for a robotics project, so I did this in SolidWorks as seen in the attached .sldpart file."
