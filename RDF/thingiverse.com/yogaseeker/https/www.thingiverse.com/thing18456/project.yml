function: I'm thinking about making a chess set and this is my first design of a chess piece. It is 2.5 inches which is too big for my chess board, but it will make a nice conversation piece. It took 46 minutes for my Makerbot Thing-O-Matic with MK7 and 1.75 mm black plastic (no rafting). Wipe that Heated Build Platform with rubbing alcohol to get a great stick and no curling!!!
