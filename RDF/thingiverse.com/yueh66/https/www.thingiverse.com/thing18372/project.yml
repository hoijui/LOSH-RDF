function: "This creature is combined of a lantern fish, a crab and an octopus.\r\nSince this is a creature design, I have decided to go with a more unconventional object for its shell.\r\nAfter searching through various water-tank decorations, I have decided to settle with the Easter Island Statue as the shell."
