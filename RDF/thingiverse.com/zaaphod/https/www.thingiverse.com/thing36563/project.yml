function: This is my very first thing!  I was having difficulty setting my printer head to table distance, the majority of the problem for me is my bifocals never being in the correct place to see clearly.  So I devised this simple height gauge, it's just a little lightweight lever with build in pivot, and a base with a reference on it.
