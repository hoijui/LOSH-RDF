    okh:function """I had very bad curling problems while trying to print the sun gears in ABS... the overhanging cone in the center kept curling up and then the extruder would hit it.  I realized it only curled away from the brake tab, because the brake tab was holding it from curling.  So as a solution, I added 2 more brake tabs, I also widened the small part of the cone just a little bit to reduce the overhang distance.   I also had problems with the gear teeth curling up from the platform, so I printed them with a brim in slic3r and that solved the problem, trimming the brim off was not too hard, as I made it wide enough (6mm) so I could just grab it and pull it away from the gear.   This is posted as a work in progress because I am still printing the rest of the parts to assemble this and I'm not completely sure there will be clearance for 3 brake tabs, although it appears to be fine in openscad.\r
\r
Update:  I have my transmission model finished and assembled and these gears are working great with it!""" ;
