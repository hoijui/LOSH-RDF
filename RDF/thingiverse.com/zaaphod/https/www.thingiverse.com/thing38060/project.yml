function: 'I figured out how to get a pin in the 2 halves of the long shaft, and as I was messing with it, it occurred to me, I had room to make it even larger... why on earth would I want to do that you ask?  well, it seems my model would be lacking 2 features of an automatic transmission that could be easily included in this model with a longer shaft... those are:  Neutral and Park.  So with the added length, I can pull the shaft so the driving hex is completely out of the stand thus being able to turn free and also allowing free movement of the annulus, providing a neutral position, then setting a few brakes while in this will provide a Park position.  Park works better with my sun gears with 3 brake tabs if you get one brake slightly ahead and the other slightly behind, it will lock up pretty good, while the shaft all the way out allows the drive end to turn free.'
