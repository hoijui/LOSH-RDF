\r
Because certain issues printing with my Leapfrog Creatr I was designing a colling system for the printer nozzle so I can solve my problems with bridges and that kind of fails in my prints, and to increase printing speed.\r
\r
I needed about 6 versions (someones with sub-versions) but finally IÂ´m happy with this final design. \r
This design can use a 50x50mm fan or a 60x60mm one, IÂ´ll suggest a 60 one with an CFM between 19 and 36 (easy to find over ebay), with a 50mm kind prints are good but not the best we can achieve.\r
\r
I also added in both sides holes to insert a couple of 5mm leds so we can see better the printing area :D""" ;
