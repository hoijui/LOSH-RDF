function: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nBecause certain issues when printing bridges and problematic areas with my Leapfrog Creatr I decided to design a colling system for the printer\xC3\x82\xC2\xB4s nozzle.\r\nAn add on is the increased printing speed.\r\n\r\nI needed about 6 versions (someones with sub-versions) but finally I\xC3\x82\xC2\xB4m happy with this final design.\r\nThis design can use a 50x50mm fan or a 60x60mm one, I\xC3\x82\xC2\xB4ll suggest a 50x50mm one (easy to find over ebay, I bought this one \"Delta AUB0512HB 50x50x15mm 5015 DC 12V 0.15A Brushless Fan 2-pin 2510 Connector\"), but there is a choice to use a 60x60mm kind, but it will crash a little with the right rear stepper.\r\n\r\nI also added in both sides holes to insert a couple of 5mm leds so we can see better the printing area :D"
