function: "This is a clip-on mount for attaching a brushless blower fan to a Printrbot+ extruder. Assuming the extruder dimensions are constant, this will likely work for all Printrbots with laser-cut wooden extruders.  \r\n\r\nIt was designed to work with a 5015S blower fan purchased from eBay for $4.89, which is 50mmx15mm high, runs at 3800rpm, and puts out 20CFM. It runs circles around the 40mm PC fans I'd tried previously to use to cool filament.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, it looks as though the bottom edge of the blower is lower than the tip of the extruder nozzle, but that's due to the angle at which the photo was taken. The bottom edge of the fan housing is at least 1mm higher than the end of the nozzle, which is plenty."
