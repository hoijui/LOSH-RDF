function = "This is a shoe I designed to mount to my Hexacopter camera gimbal to hold my NEX-5N. Basically I have the shoe mounted to the gimbal and then use velcro straps through the side holes to attach the camera when desired. This is intended to work with the 18-55 lens, although it may work for others as well. \r\n\r\nUpdate: the diameter of the lens cutout wasnt right so I made a v3 that is much better"
