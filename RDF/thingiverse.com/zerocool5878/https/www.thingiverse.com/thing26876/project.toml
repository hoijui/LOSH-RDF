function = "I have tweak this a bit to accomodate a 50mm fan. Also added raspberry cut out to act as the exhaust vent on the top. Modified the original vents making them more round and put them on the bottom.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Moved the video rca cutout 1.2mm toward the headphone jack. I might add some clips at some point too. \r\n\r\nUpdate 7/16: Adjusted fan mounts that should fit all 50mm fans\r\n\r\nUpdate 7/24: I made this 40mm version a week ago but for some reason it slipped my mind and I never posted it. :) I will also replace the sketchup file with one that has both 40 and 50mm tops\r\n\r\nUpdate: 8/24: Some people were having issues with the manifold. I have solved the problem and it seems to be just fine now.\r\n\r\nI have update all files including the sketchup file. The new version has double the thickness for the walls so it should be much more solid. I also had to make the 40mm raspberry logo smaller as it was causing the manifold problem.\r\n\r\nThanks to my buddy Chris for helping me with this."
