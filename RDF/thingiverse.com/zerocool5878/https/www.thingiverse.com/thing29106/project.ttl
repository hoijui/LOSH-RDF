As long as the angles are not compromised it should function properly. I will likely print this out as is this weekend just to see how much more work it needs. \r
\r
I have not decided on the way I am going to mount the pieces together. I am thinking about using a threaded hollow rod and nuts but im sure something printed could be done as well.\r

\r
This Star Dial is intended to tell time at night without the use of a watch. It is something they used hundreds of years ago but still works the same way.\r
\r
Note: As far as I know this will only work in the Northern Hemisphere. Also when holding this to the Sky it should have JD to the top. \r
\r
This thing was designed using instructions for a paper star dial here\r
