.i modified the original by making the cone snap in and out as well as chopping off the hard corners.   



print it with exterior support  



this is still a work in progress, it works but i can make it better  



the large cone i printed failed half way through so i glued it to another cone i had to make a super mega phone cone.  



the straight one with the small cone is pretty damn loud  i drilled out the hole so its not the correct size for slip in fit.  



this is a video of the sound difference
