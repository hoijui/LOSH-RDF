function: "I HAVE MOVED ALL MY DESIGNS TO MY OWN SITE http://www.tmophoto.com/product-category/3d-product-download/  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.  \n.i modified the original by making the cone snap in and out as well as chopping off the hard corners.   \n\n\n\nprint it with exterior support  \n\n\n\nthis is still a work in progress, it works but i can make it better  \n\n\n\nthe large cone i printed failed half way through so i glued it to another cone i had to make a super mega phone cone.  \n\n\n\nthe straight one with the small cone is pretty damn loud  i drilled out the hole so its not the correct size for slip in fit.  \n\n\n\nthis is a video of the sound difference  \n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/zgbot/5516445973/"
