Oye!**\r\n\r\n[Brenda the articulated battle tardigrade](http://bit.ly/1W8W1Ag) has been released into the wilds of 3D printing!\r\n\r\n [Join the Horde](http://horde.zheng3.com) to be among the first humanoids to learn about the next epic project from Zheng Labs!\r\n\r\n*We now return you to your regular model description.*\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis nefarious device can easily launch a U.S. penny across a room when printed at 1:1 scale.   \r\n   \r\nIt's the first upgrade many Seej players seek when they need a little more oomph than the Zheng3 Penny Catapult can provide.  \r\n\r\nSeej is an open-source tabletop wargame based around 3D printing.  Rules for Seej are at [s33j.net](http://www.s33j.net)  \r\n\r\nDo you need this in your arsenal? Yes. Yes you do.  \r\n\r\nPenny not included!"
