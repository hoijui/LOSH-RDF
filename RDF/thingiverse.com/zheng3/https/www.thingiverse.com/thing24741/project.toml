function = "\"Keeping one's true intentions hidden is best.\"\r\n\r\n--Qie Zi, The Art of Seej\r\n\r\nThere's a password to a secret Seej model hidden inside the data for the Cryptstone Bloxen. The secret model isn't available on Thingiverse, and only those who break the code can find it.\r\n\r\nCryptanalysis geeks, covert operators, and NSA employees will find the code trivially easy to crack, what with all their fancy algorithms and server farms and such, but the rest of us can probably do it with pencil, paper, and some sweet, sweet brain grease. \r\n\r\nThe door to The Crypt stands covered in dust at http://crypt.s33j.net. The model lies beyond the door.\r\n\r\nStuck? Need a hint? Follow http://twitter.com/Zheng3_Jim and send me a direct message.\r\n\r\nGood luck. Glory XOR doom awaits you."
