function = "The Minister's Cat is a word game we play with our kids on long car trips, or at least it is when we can pry them away from their bickering and iPods for a few minutes.  \n\n\n\nPlayers take turns describing the Minister's Cat with an adjective, progressing through the alphabet as they go.   \n\n\n\nFirst player gets \"A,\"  and says the Minister's Cat is an **awesome** cat. Second player uses \"B\" and says the Minister's Cat is a **brave** cat. And so on. If you can't think of a word, you're out.  \n\n\n\nToday, the Minister's Cat is a ***Voronoi*** cat.  \n\n\n\nThe zip file contains the spiffy Voronoi cat, and a generic cat and base for you to remix so we can all play The Minister's Cat on Thingiverse."
