Players take turns describing the Minister's Cat with an adjective, progressing through the alphabet as they go.   



First player gets "A,"  and says the Minister's Cat is an **awesome** cat. Second player uses "B" and says the Minister's Cat is a **brave** cat. And so on. If you can't think of a word, you're out.  



Today, the Minister's Cat is a ***Voronoi*** cat.  



The zip file contains the spiffy Voronoi cat, and a generic cat and base for you to remix so we can all play The Minister's Cat on Thingiverse.""" ;
