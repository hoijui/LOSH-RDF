function: "I ordered some filament online and the spool had a 32mm diameter hole in it! So I made this for mounting it on a makerbot replicator. It seems to work fine... also works great for larger size spools (all spools really)! The 8% angle keeps the spool tight against the machine without any annoying finger squeezing.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it's actually better than the ones that come with the replicator..."
