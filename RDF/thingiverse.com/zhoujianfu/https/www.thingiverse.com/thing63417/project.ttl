\r
Do they also love pressing the "home" button?\r
\r
Do they not know how to re-open the app yet?\r
\r
If you answered "yes" to all three of these questions, the TPiMBB is for you!\r
\r
Simply print (you won't need support.. maybe a raft?) and place on iPad Mini! It'll stick on tight enough so your toddler can't remove it (but you can!), and completely cover up the home button!\r
\r
Enjoy the peace and quiet.\r
\r
You're welcome.\r

(This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/bsvgJVwQK6X .. maybe make an iPad Maxi version, somebody?)""" ;
