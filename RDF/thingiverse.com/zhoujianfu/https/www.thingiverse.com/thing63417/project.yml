function: "Do you have a little kid who loves using your iPad mini?\r\n\r\nDo they also love pressing the \"home\" button?\r\n\r\nDo they not know how to re-open the app yet?\r\n\r\nIf you answered \"yes\" to all three of these questions, the TPiMBB is for you!\r\n\r\nSimply print (you won't need support.. maybe a raft?) and place on iPad Mini! It'll stick on tight enough so your toddler can't remove it (but you can!), and completely cover up the home button!\r\n\r\nEnjoy the peace and quiet.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome.\r\n\r\n(This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/bsvgJVwQK6X .. maybe make an iPad Maxi version, somebody?)"
