function = "This is a spinoff from my boxotron software. It creates a dxf for a paper box.\r\n\r\nI was just going to alter the boxotron script but ended up rewriting the majority of it. \r\n\r\nThe box design was shamelessly stolen from 4Volt ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:254 ) Thanks 4Volt ! \r\n\r\nIt is only good for thin card ( for now ) as the insets and offsets for thicker material are not calculated.\r\n\r\nMuch like the boxotron this is a command line program , run ./cardbox.py -h for more information"
