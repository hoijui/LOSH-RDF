function = "This is my first cut of a 3D turntable scanner that can be printed on a cupcake/reprap. It is by no means finished but it is a start. \r\n\r\nIt has a turntable  driven by a motor ( a size I had in my \\'bits\\' box ) and mounts for a camera and the laser line drawer.\r\n\r\nIt needs heaps more work but I thought I\\'d put the first cut into the thingiverse and see what people came up with \r\n\r\nThe blender file of the complete device is included in the tar gzip file. I have not uploaded all the stl files individually , grab the zip if you want them all.\r\n\r\nTo build it you will need a 608 bearing , 5mm (or 3/8 ) rod , some M4-20 bolts , a motor , webcam , laser pointer and possibly a PHD in quantum physics :P\r\n\r\nThere is no software yet but this \r\n\r\nhttp://www.sjbaker.org/wiki/index.php?title=A_Simple_3D_Scanner\r\n\r\nlooks like a good start; combined with an arduino to index the wheel and some scripting this could be a automatic scanner."
