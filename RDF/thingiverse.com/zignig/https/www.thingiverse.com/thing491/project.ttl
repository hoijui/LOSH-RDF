    okh:function """This is my first cut of a 3D turntable scanner that can be printed on a cupcake/reprap. It is by no means finished but it is a start. \r
\r
It has a turntable  driven by a motor ( a size I had in my \\'bits\\' box ) and mounts for a camera and the laser line drawer.\r
\r
It needs heaps more work but I thought I\\'d put the first cut into the thingiverse and see what people came up with \r
\r
The blender file of the complete device is included in the tar gzip file. I have not uploaded all the stl files individually , grab the zip if you want them all.\r
\r
To build it you will need a 608 bearing , 5mm (or 3/8 ) rod , some M4-20 bolts , a motor , webcam , laser pointer and possibly a PHD in quantum physics :P\r
\r
There is no software yet but this \r

\r
looks like a good start; combined with an arduino to index the wheel and some scripting this could be a automatic scanner.""" ;
