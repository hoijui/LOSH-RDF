function = "A small desk clamp.\r\n\r\nWorks but it requires a little more super glue than I would have liked. \r\n\r\nIt was designed to be a PCB holder (the one Lady Ada uses in her instructions was the inspiration).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ladyada.net/images/usbtinyisp/tools.jpg\r\n\r\nThe base is too small making it unstable.\r\n\r\nHowever I just finished printing it and it works! \r\n\r\nTo make it you will also need.\r\n\r\n3/8 (5mm will do as well) threaded rod and some square nuts. \r\nSquare brass tubing ( 3.9 mm ) and the size that fits just inside that.\r\n\r\nNeeds some more work:\r\n\r\nBigger base , maybe multipart\r\nBetter way to hold the clamps\r\n\r\nThe tar file contains the blend , photos and all the stl files."
