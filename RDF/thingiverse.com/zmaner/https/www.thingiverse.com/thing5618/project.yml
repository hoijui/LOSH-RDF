function: "This is a Cable holder that you can mount to your wall or desk.  I figured I was sick of all those cables in a tangle mess so I designed this and have found it very useful.  Included are Corel Draw Ver. 14 and 10.  Please let me know what you think about this and I hope it is useful for you.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
