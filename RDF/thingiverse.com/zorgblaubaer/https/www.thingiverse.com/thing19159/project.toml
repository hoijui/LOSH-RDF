function = "When mounting trucks onto a longboard, you sometimes want to adjust its height (to prevent 'wheelbites') and/or angle (to make the truck turn more or less) by putting a riser between the truck and the deck. I created it with OpenSCAD, so changes can easily be made to the height and angle (in a future version probably with 2 variables), and printed it in the FabLab at RWTH Aachen University: http://hci.rwth-aachen.de/fablab"
