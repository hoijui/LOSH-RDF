function = "This is a flight base and space ship to use in the table top combat game X-Wing Miniatures.  The ship, obviously, is a non-star wars design.  The flight base is sized to fit Micro-Machine ships (like the A wing in the picture).  The painted ship is scaled up, but prints great at a small size."
