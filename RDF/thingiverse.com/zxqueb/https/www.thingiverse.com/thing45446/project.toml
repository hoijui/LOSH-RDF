function = "I decided to try to use tinkercad to create a base mesh for a figure and detail it in sculptris.  I had to take it back into tinkercad to base it because opening the base part in sculptris didn't keep the hard edges I wanted.  It seems like using a combonation of the two works well to create organic (sculptris) and inorganic (tinkercad) forms.  Tinkercad also works well to put elements together.  \r\n\r\nI haven't printed this yet.  I will probably have to chop up the model to make for easier printing.\r\n\r\nHere is the link to the tinkercad page: https://tinkercad.com/things/4YtA7aesa8r-base-mesh-tinkercad-final-mesh-sculptris"
