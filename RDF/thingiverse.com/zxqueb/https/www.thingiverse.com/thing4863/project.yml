function: I'm playing around with creating some organic shapes in idough (like a simplified zbrush) for the ipod touch and exporting more or less directly to the 3d printer.  I'm hoping to provide some of my students a more intuitive workflow with a "clay ball" experience for a fairly inexpensive cost (assuming they have an itouch or iphone).   You'll need to mess with the support / angle of the print to get a clean print.
